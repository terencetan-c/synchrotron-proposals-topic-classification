<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of these experiments was to investigate the mechanisms and kinetics of transitions between various lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases formed by monoelaidin (ME) / water, dioleoylphophatidylethanolamine (DOPE)/water and 1-monoolein (MO)/water systems, including the nature of any intermediates formed. Using the pressure-jump technique we have been able to begin to probe the mechanisms of lamellar to non-lamellar (inverse hexagonal and bicontinuous cubic) phases and the interconversion of the bicontinuous cubic phases. In total, using SAXS we were able to monitor the complete time evolution of over 70 pressure jumps including: 14 for DOPE/16 wt%H 2 O (L α H II ), 4 for DOPE /14 wt%H 2 O (L α H II ), 36 for MO/30 wt%H 2 O (Q II D Q II G ), 10 for ME (L α Q II ) and 8 for MO/17 wt% H 2 O(L α Q II ). Given the large number of jumps that were undertaken over the course of our time at the ESRF it is not possible to discuss every data set in detail and we have therefore discussed one or two individual runs that give a general overview of our results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D ) Transition: A Structural Analysis</head><p>Many cellular processes including endo-and exocytosis, fat digestion and membrane budding involve changes in membrane topology. The inverse bicontinuous cubic phases may act as intermediates in these processes and it is likely that the mechanism of formation of the cubic phase from a corresponding fluid lamellar has much in common with the mechanism of cell membrane fusion and fission. The results obtained have indicated several fascinating features which agree with measurements made by us during temperaturejump experiments at Imperial College and lend credence to our proposed theory for membrane fusion processes. These include the decrease in lamellar lattice parameter on transforming to the cubic phase(Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>), the appearance of a broad low-angle peak immediately afterwards and the formation of an initially highly swollen cubic phase which decreases to an equilibrium value(Figure <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). It is thought that the decrease in lamellar lattice parameter reflects a geometrically constrained thinning of the bilayer associated with the transition to the cubic phase. The broad intermediate and the presence of a highly swollen cubic phase can be explained by the concerted movement of water on transforming from the lamellar to the much more highly hydrated cubic phase. A number of features not seen on temperature-jump experiments have also been noted, including the coexistence of the lamellar phase with highly swollen Q II P and Q II D phases, and the direct formation of the Q II D phase from the lamellar phase if a very large pressure-jump is employed. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Integrated Peak Intensity, arbitrary units Time, s 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Integrated Peak Intensity, arbitrary units Time, s Figure 2: Peak Intensities of the 2 Q II D and 6 Q II G peaks with time following a pressure jump from (a)60-580 bar, (b)70-640 bar Figure 2 shows the changing peak intensity of the 2 Q II D and 6 Q II G peaks with time following each of the pressure-jumps. An initial very short delay of &lt;0.5 seconds is noted when only negligible changes in intensity are observed. The data following this initial decay was fitted using an exponential curve of the form ) exp( t x A I I t -+ = ∞</p><p>I t denotes the intensity of the peak at time t.

The rate of disappearance of the Q II D phase is in good agreement with the rate of appearance of the Q II G phase. An increase of pressure-jump amplitude is clearly associated with an increase in the rate of the phase transition. The results shown in table 1 are again representative of the much larger data set that we were able to acquire during the nine shifts. These measurements are now allowing us for the first time to determine the activation energy per lipid molecule for these complex and collective processes. With the successful development of this methodology we plan to compare the activation barriers between different lipid systems in the future and draw conclusions about molecular effects on the transition state.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1:A lamellar-to-cubic transition from1130-250 bar, T=49.6 0 C is shown.
