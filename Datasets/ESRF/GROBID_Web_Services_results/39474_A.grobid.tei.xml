The goal of the experiment was to perform accurate, non-destructive determination of depth concentration profiles with HAXPES (2-12 keV) on advanced CMOS structures deposited on high mobility substrates such as Ge. During the beamtime, two samples having the structure described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (Ge/Si/SiO2/HfO2/TiN stack) have been studied. The use of electrons with kinetic energies from few eV up to 15 keV enables to tune the information depth being able to analyze the desired interface in a non-destructive way. XRR enables the determination of the exact layer thickness and density (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>The results suggest that the Si interlayer prevents the Ge oxidation (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Depth profiles of the electronic structure have been obtained for both samples by following the evolution of the photoemission signal from the Hf 2p3/2 core level as a function of the photoelectron kinetic energy (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The depth profile of the electronic structure reveals the presence of a chemical shift of the Hf 2p3/2 core level, which is related to an interfacial bonding state. Our results demonstrate the excellent capability of HAXPES to study buried interfaces in a non-destructive way. are composed of a Ge/SiO2/HfO2/TiN stack with thickness of 2500, 0.9, 0.5, 5 3.4nmand 2500, 0.7, 1, 5.8, 3 nm, respectively, as obtained from the X-ray reflectivity measurements.

(a) Si 1s spectra for sample A taken at a photon energy of 11 keV, which corresponds to an electron kinetic energy of 9 keV. The extremely high sensitivity of HAXPES enables the discrimination between Si and from a SiO2 monolayer buried at depths 8.5nm and 8 nm, respectively. Representative Ge 1s and 2s spectra taken at a photon energy between 11 keV and 17 keV, which corresponds to an electron kinetic energy range between 3.5 keV and 11.5 keV, are given for Ge-bulk (b), sample A (c) and sample B (d). The large penetration depth of high kinetic energy electrons enables the analysis of the Ge substrate buried by 10nm thick layers for sample A and sample B. No trace of Ge oxide is present on the spectra. Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Fig. 4.
