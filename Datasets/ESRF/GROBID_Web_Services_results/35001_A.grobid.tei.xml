<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of this study was to investigate the phase diagram of light alkaline graphite intercalation compound (GICs) such as LiC 6 at high pressures and high temperatures using a radial geometry. Due to the high air-sensitivity of the sample and difficulties related to the radial geometry, we followed through the HP study with an heavier sample, i.e. CsC 8 , in the classical axial geometry available at the ID27 beamline.</p><p>High-pressure (HP) XRD of CsC 8 was performed up to 14.0 GPa. A sequence of selected diffraction patterns is displayed in Figure A. The first pattern recorded at 0.2 GPa matches the hexagonal ambient structure. Inhomogeneous grain size distribution, preferential orientation effects and the identified stacking faults render a Rietveld refinement or even a Le Bail refinement extremely complex. Gradual transformations under increasing pressure is the most eye-catching feature as well as the overall decrease of intensity of the diffraction patterns. At 1.2 GPa, we observe the coexistence of the hexagonal phase with a new phase. This new phase is clearly established at 2.0 GPa. At 3.5 GPa, new changes in the diffraction pattern evidence a new phase transformation. Furthermore, we notice that the number of peaks of this last high pressure phase is lower than in the preceding phases, which could be associated to a higher cell symmetry or to a smaller lattice. As the pressure increases from 7.3 GPa to 14 GPa, the diffraction line broadening becomes more and more pronounced, and the profile becomes highly asymmetric. We deduced a linear compressibility κ c of 1.079×10 -2 GPa -1 corresponding to a linear bulk modulus B c of 93 GPa for the hexagonal phase (CsC 8 -I). The a lattice parameter was found to be very rigid in this pressure range. We estimated the bulk modulus B v =94 GPa, close to the linear inter-plane bulk modulus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ESRF Experiment Report Form July 1999</head><p>Different attempts to determine the crystal structures of the high pressure phases appearing above 1.2 GPa and above 3.5 GPa were carried out. The presence of a diffraction line at very low angle ∼2 • corresponding to a d-spacing of 7.69 Å prompted us to look for a larger crystalline cell assuming a new stacking. We propose the space group C222 as a possible candidate for the first HP phase. This choice corresponds to a space group search procedure with the Crysfyre Suite and Checkcell softwares. Among the possible space groups obtained, C222 reproduced best the experimental data. The corresponding orthorhombic lattice is described in term of a supercell with parameters fitted within a Le Bail refinement. The second HP phase, observed between 3.5 and 8.0 GPa was found to be very close to the orthorhombic cell defined in RbC 8 and in CsC 4 , a superdense metastable phase of Cs-GICs. We used the same space group Fddd and Wyckoff positions as RbC 8 for the refinement model. This supposes a change of the stacking from αβγ to αβγδ with a corresponding I c =c/4=5.72 Å (a=4.39 Å b=9.20 Å and c=22.87 Å). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">B</ref> shows the Le Bail refinement and residuals for the two HP phases using the GSAS analysis software. The two refinements are not completely satisfying: in the 4.8 GPa refinement, essentially broadening is not taken into account as we can see. And in the 2.0 GPa refinement, the position of the peak located around 2 • is not well reproduced. In order to check the validity of our proposed lattices and to go deeper into the structural determination, i.e. to determine the atomic positions, better complementary and/or quality data are needed. We shall mention that this present study reports for the first time HP transformations of the CsC 8 graphite intercalation compound.</p><p>In addition, we recently carried out Neutron Powder Diffraction at HP. The global results concerning the HP behavior of CsC 8 is the object of a submitted article.
