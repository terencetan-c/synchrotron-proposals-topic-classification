<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of these experiments was to investigate transitions between various lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases formed by the monoelaidin (ME) / water system, including the nature of any intermediates formed. This is the first time pressure-jump experiments have been carried out on this lipid system, and we were able to begin to probe the mechanisms behind the L α -&gt;Q II</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P +Q II D , L β -&gt;Q II D , L α -&gt; Q II D , Q II D -&gt; L β and Q II D -&gt; L β + Q II P phase transitions.</formula><p>Given that many cellular processes, including endo-and exocytosis, fat digestion and membrane budding, involve changes in membrane topology and that the inverse bicontinuous cubic phases may act as intermediates in these processes it is likely that the mechanism of formation of the cubic phase from a corresponding fluid lamellar has much in common with the mechanism of cell membrane fusion and fission. The results have indicated several interesting features which agree with measurements made by us during temperature-jump experiments and lend credence to our proposed new theory for membrane fusion processes. These include the decrease in lamellar lattice parameter on transforming to the cubic phase, the appearance of a broad low-angle peak immediately afterwards and the formation of an initially highly swollen cubic phase which decreases to an equilibrium value. A number of features not seen on temperature-jump experiments have also been noted, including the coexistence of the lamellar phase with highly swollen Q II P and Q II D phases, and the direct formation of the Q II D phase from the lamellar if a very large pressure-jump is employed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L α α α α (Q II P + Q II D</formula><p>) Transition (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) Results from the pressure-jump experiments demonstrate that the L α lattice parameter gradually decreases following the jump reaching a final value of 51.8Å before disappearing (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) reflecting a geometrically constrained thinning of the bilayer associated with the transition to the cubic phase.

The final lattice parameter lies in a narrow band between 51.7 and 52.2Å.</p><p>This disappearance of the L α phase is accompanied by the appearance of a broad low-angle peak from which the Q II P peaks continuously grow, which can be explained by the concerted movement of water on transforming from the lamellar to the much more highly hydrated cubic phase, resulting in a range of hydrations. This is supported by the highly swollen Q II P phase that initially forms, its lattice parameter decaying with time to an equilibrium lattice parameter of 144.5Å. The transition between the lamellar and cubic phases has been observed to pass through a highly swollen cubic phase in both the forward and reverse directions for several systems, the mechanism somehow forcing the uptake of a large amount of water by the cubic phase which is subsequently released. Here the initial lamellar phase coexists with several extremely swollen Q II D phases, the highest having a lattice parameter of 182.4Å. The large lattice parameter may be explained by the high pressure but the coexistence of these two phases has never before been seen under any conditions. The Q II D phase may be observed at various stages throughout the transition, its temporary absences explained by the peaks passing beneath those of the Q II P phase. The ratio of the lattice parameters of these two phases is initially high (1.41) decreasing towards an average value of 1.301. This is within 2% of a theoretical value known as the Bonnet Ratio a(P)/a(D)=1.279. A Bonnet Transformation is a mapping transformation by which the minimal surfaces upon which the cubic structures are based may be interchanged. Such a transformation, though physically unviable, gives rise to a specific ratio of lattice parameters for cubic phases coexisting under equilibrium conditions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L β β β β Q II D Transition Figure 1(b)</formula><p>shows a much larger amplitude pressure-jump beginning in the L β phase and finishing in the Q II D cubic phase. Immediately following the jump, the lamellar phase transforms from the gel-like L β phase to the fluid lamellar L α . Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>(b) shows the layer spacing during this transition. The melting of the hydrocarbon chains causes an immediate decrease in lattice parameter due to the decrease in bilayer thickness. The broadness of the L α peak immediately subsequent to the jump is thought to reflect a P β intermediate phase, this cannot, however, be verified without wide-angle data. The subsequent increase in lattice parameter reflects the uptake of water due to increased bilayer repulsion in the L α phase. We then see the gradual decrease in L α lattice parameter associated with the transition to the cubic phase. Unlike largeamplitude temperature-jumps to the Q II D phase, the transition is not observed to pass through an intermediate Q II P phase. Rather, the lamellar phase transforms directly to a swollen Q II D phase, again via an intermediate characterised by a broad hump in the diffraction pattern. The position of the broad hump lies to higher-angle than that noted in transitions passing though a Q II P phase, possibly reflecting the lower lattice parameter of the forming Q II D compared with the Q II P phase.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L α α α α Q II D Transition. Figure 1(c)</formula><p>shows a transition from the fluid lamellar to the Q II D phase, displaying several features in common with the previous transition. We again see the characteristic decrease in L α lattice parameter (Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>) before the appearance of a broad peak centred on a similar 2 angle to that seen previously, the Q II D phase growing directly from this broad peak. The sharpening and intensifying of the Q II D peaks with time coupled with the decrease in lattice parameter towards an equilibrium value and the existence of a second Q II D phase decreasing to the same value are also features of both transitions. The presence of an intermediate Q II P phase distinguishes this transition from the previous one. Previous temperature-jump work has shown the L α -Q II D transition to always proceed via an intermediate Q II P phase and its absence in the previous transition is unusual. However the appearance of the Q II P phase after the Q II D is highly unusual. The Q II P phase is, however, weak and initially at very low scattering angle where the noise is greatest and it is possible that the earlier peaks are simply not being detected. The four cubic phases seen throughout the transition show a marked decrease in lattice parameter with time. They may be considered as two pairs, each consisting of an Q II P phase and a Q II D phase. The lattice parameters of both sets of pairs again exhibit a ratio close to that predicted by the Bonnet relationship; one set having an average ratio of 1.275 and the second 1.286. It is interesting to note that this ratio is still upheld under the conditions above where the system is far from equilibrium. cubic phase before exhibiting a direct transition to the gel-like L β , bypassing the L α phase completely.</p><p>This prelimary report has been submitted as part of our application for further beamtime at the ESRF. A more complete summary will be submitted at a later date. As demonstrated above we now have a better idea of the conditions required and timescales involved in a variety of transitions. However, a more systematic analysis is required if we are to draw firm conclusions on the mechanistic pathways and monitor effects such as that of the pressure-jump amplitude upon the kinetics. We have also measured the rate of transition as a function of the pressure-jump amplitude in order to calculate the activation energy for a variety of transitions in DOPE and MO systems, and this data is presently being analysed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: A series of 'stacked' plots showing transitions from the lamellar to the cubic phase.
