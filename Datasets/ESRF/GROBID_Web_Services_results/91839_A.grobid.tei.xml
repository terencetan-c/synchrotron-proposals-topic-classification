<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The in situ growth properties of ML-thick transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 are barely understood. In this beamtime we planned to address this issue by studying in situ and in real-time the structural and morphological evolution of MoS2 samples grown by MBE on Pt(111) using GIXD and GISAXS. The growth of this new system is currently being developed at CINaM using in situ LEEM/PEEM microscopy technique. The expected results included the atomic structure determination of the as-grown samples using the mapping of the reciprocal space along CTRs. We also planned to determine by GIXD the MoS2 stacking on the substrate. The morphology of the MoS2 islands (typical island-sizes and inter-island distances) was to be monitored with GISAXS.</p><p>-Results and the conclusions of the study (main part): -</p><p>The Pt(111) surface has been prepared following a well-established procedure including Ar-ion bombardment at room temperature, annealing under O2 partial pressure (650-700°C) and a final high-temperature flash (&gt;1000°C). The quality of the surface has been confirmed as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> by the map of the reciprocal space. Bragg peak (3,0,0) CTR (2,0,0) CTR (1,0,0) Bragg peak (1,1,0) Bragg peak (2,2,0) CTR (2,1,0) Scattering vector</p><p>The growth of MoS2 is based on the deposition of Mo by molecular beam epitaxy under H2S partial pressure. Unfortunately, due to malfunctions of the H2S gas injection setup during the beamtime, we have not been able to reproduce the growth of MoS2 layers obtained at CINaM.</p><p>-Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.): -</p><p>The preparation of the substrate in the BM32 beamline setup is now validated along with the calibration of the Mo deposition source. Issues with the injection gas system prevented us to elaborate suitable MoS2 layers.</p><p>-Publication(s): -None</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Reciprocal space mapping of a clean Pt(111) surface in the hk plane at grazing incidence (l=0.06).</figDesc><graphic coords="1,182.16,484.80,231.00,197.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
