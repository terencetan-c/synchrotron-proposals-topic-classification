<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Diamond anvil cells, equipped with internal heater, were installed for the first time on ID 22. They were used to measure the synchrotron-induced X-ray fluorescence of Rb and Sr solutions in situ at simultaneously high pressures and high temperatures. An incident X-ray beam of 18 keV was used and fluorescent X-rays of 13.4 (Rb) and 14.2 keV (Sr) were detected at the rear side of the high pressure cell, in a 165¡ geometry. Despite the strong Compton scattering in this geometry, concentrations as low as 1000 ppm of Rb and Sr could be detected and anlyzed in the fluid. In further experiments, it should be possible to modify the collection angle and thus to lower the detection limit by an order of magnitude. Temperature was measured with a thermocouple whereas, pressure in the sample chamber was measured using ruby fluorescence. For this purpose, a pressure measurement optical system from the ESRF high-pressure laboratory was installed on the beamline. Solutions with known proportions and concentrations of Rb and Sr were loaded into capillary cells and diamond-cell to calibrate Rb and Sr fluorescence yields in this experimental configuration. The diamond anvil cell was then loaded with Rb-containing solutions, ruby and single crystal of strontianite (SrCO 3 ) in a drilled rhenium gasket. The composition of the fluid was analysed during heating at high pressure (up to 250°C and 4.15 GPa), the Sr/Rb ratio being followed away from the crystal as a function of time. This experiment gives the first data on the dissolution rate and solubility of strontium carbonate at conditions relevant to deep mantle subduction in the Earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The following calibration solutions of rubidium and strontium nitrates have been measured in both capillary cells and diamond anvil cell at both ambient and high pressure (up to 1GPa): Rb0.08M-Sr0.02M, Rb0.05M-Sr0.05M, Rb0.02M-Sr0.08M, Rb0.0005M-Sr0.0005M. Dissolution experiments of strontianite single crystals in Rb0.01M solutions were then performed along isothermal paths at the following pressures (GPa), temperatures (¡C) respectively : 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, 1, 1.3, 1.8, 2.4, 3.1, 3.6, 4.1 GPa and 25, 100, 250¡C . Typical spectra obtained at high pressure and high temperature (1GPa, 100¡C), in the diamond-cell are shown in the figure together with a reference spectra of the solution at ambient conditions for comparison (0.4 GPa, 25¡C). The strontium carbonate solubility is dramatically enhanced as pressure is increased; For example, the Rb/Sr ratio measured at 3.6 GPa and 250¡C is 0.05, in a solution initallly Rb0.01M and containing no Sr, which means that strontianite is 100 time more soluble at these conditions than at ambient conditions. It was carefully checked (by loading an empty cell with a strontianite single crystal) that no pollution by X-rays of Sr coming from the single crystal came at significant levels in the area of the fluid probed by the X-ray beam. We checked that thermodynamic modelling of the reaction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">SrCO 3 &lt;---&gt; Sr 2+ + CO 3 2- (1)</formula><p>using low-pressure type of data is globally consistent with those experimental results. The obvious reason for the solubility increase of strontium carbonate with increasing pressure at constant temperature is the large negative reaction volume (∆V = -58.9 cm 3 /mol). Such a solubility increase had been observed at lower pressures but no available thermodynamic data base on aqeous species in solution allowed to extrapolate qualtitatively and quantitatively to pressures such as those investigated in the present study. Our experimental results have thus important consequences for modelling quantitatively the behaviour of strontium in subduction zones, and more generally for better constraining thermodynamic modelling of aqueous species at extreme pressures and temperatures.</p><p>Those data were obtained by fixing the X-ray beam at one point in the fluid, away from the single crystal, and by waiting long enough (typically 30 minutes) for having a constant value. The increase in the strontium concentration obtained by analyzing the fluid at a fixed point every 10 minutes allowed to get first data about dissolution rates of strontianite at high pressure and high temperature. This experiment is indeed quite unique in providing the possibility of collecting kinetic data in-situ which are very difficult to obtain on quenched samples. More experiments should be performed for better constraining the thermodynamic model of dissolution at high pressures and high temperatures and for obtaining rate laws of strontianite dissolution at different pressures and temperatures.</p><p>Between november 2001 and now (february 2002), the data have been processed, ie the X-ray fluoresence spectra have been analyzed and converted to concentrations. During spring 2002, we expect to prepare one manuscript about technological aspects of the experiment and one about the geochemistry of strontium solubility at high pressures and temperatures.</p><p>0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 700 750 800 850 900 T=25°C P=4.4 kbars Rb=8727, Sr=2263 Rb/Sr=3.86 Rb/Sr reel=4.37 Rb Sr 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 700 750 800 850 900</p></div>
