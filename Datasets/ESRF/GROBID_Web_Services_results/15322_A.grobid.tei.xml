<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>it is feasible to do accurate studies of chemical reactions in a diamond anvil cell at elevated temperatures, even though the sample size is miniscule. Time-resolved X-ray diffraction data in angular dispersive mode were collected at ID9 using monochromatic X-ray radiation (λ=0.4362 Å) with a CCD-based area-detector. The Princeton CCD-detector (supplied by the detectorpool) was equipped with an image intensifier, and the angular-and time-resolution were well suited for the experiments. A schematic diagram of the externally heated diamond cell [1] that was used for the experiments is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The pressurized sample chamber in the cell was approximately 250 µm in diameter and 80 µm in height. The reaction mixture consisted of amorphous titanium phosphate mixed with 85% phosphoric acid to form a gel. The gel was loaded into the diamond cell with a small ruby for pressure measurements. The temperature was monitored by Cr-Al thermocouples close to the sample, and the pressure by measuring laser-induced fluoroscence light of the small ruby in the sample chamber.</p><p>Using the software FIT2D [2] the images were corrected for spatial distortion, non-linear features in the background, Lorenz factor and polarization before subsequent integration over the entire powder rings. The progress of crystallisation and degradation was estimated from the diffraction patterns by using integrated X-ray b c d e a b</p><p>intensities of diffraction lines. Well-resolved diffraction lines with no overlap between the two phases were used. A 2θ range was defined around each diffraction peak, and a linear background was defined by using background counts on each side of the peak. The background counts were subtracted from the total counts over the 2θ range to give the net integrated intensity. The integrated intensities of the selected reflections from each phase were added and normalised to represent the percentage of crystallinity (α).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> is a 3-dimensional representation of the diffraction profiles as a function of time during the crystallisation of α-Ti(HPO 4 ) 2 ⋅ H 2 O at 170°C and 2.5 GPa. In Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> normalised integrated intensities of diffraction lines of α-Ti(HPO 4 ) 2 ⋅ H 2 O are plotted as a function of time (t). The crystallisation curve has been fitted using a first order Avrami-type rate equation, α=100(1-exp(-k(t-t 0 )), where k is a rate constant and t 0 is the starting time of the crystallisation. The fitted values became k = 0.49 min -1 and t 0 = 1.49 min.</p><p>At 220°C and 0.8 GPa alpha transform to a new phase. In Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref> the 3D plot of the conversion from α-Ti(HPO 4 ) 2 ⋅ H 2 O to the new phase is shown. The crystallisation curve (Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>) was fitted, using leastsquares methods, with a modified Avrami expression [3] α=100(1-exp(-(k(t-t 0 )) n )) and a similar expression for the degradation α=100exp(-(k(t-t 0 ) n ), where k and t 0 has the same meaning as above. The parameter n is connected to the mechanism of nucleation and crystallisation. It can clearly be seen that the crystallisation of the new phase is fitted well by the modified Avrami expression. However, the degradation of α-Ti(HPO 4 ) 2 ⋅ H 2 O does not follow the empirical expression. This can be due to an amorphous phase or structural transformations of α-Ti(HPO 4 ) 2 ⋅ H 2 O during degradation. The deviation from ideal behavior (degradation+crystallisation=100%) is shown with open circles in Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>. Fitted values to the Avrami expression became, k(degr) = 0.055 min -1 , n(degr) = 5.23, k(cryst) = 0.109 min -1 and n(cryst) = 2.36.
