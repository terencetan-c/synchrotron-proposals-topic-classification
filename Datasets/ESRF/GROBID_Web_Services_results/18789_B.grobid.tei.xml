<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the last two years we determined the high-resolution structures of both ribosomal subunits: the small one from 7KHUPXV WKHUPRSKLOXV (T30S) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Schluenzen et al., 2000)</ref> and the large from 'HLQRFRFFXV UDGLRGXUDQV (D50S) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Harms et al., 2001)</ref>. The latter is a mesophilic robust bacterium that shares over 80% identity with ( FROL, a new addition to the sources suitable for ribosomal crystallography, which was found to be extremely useful. We also determined the structures of several complexes of both subunits with clinically relevant antibiotics, ligands, inhibitors and substrate analogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Pioletti et al., 2001</ref>, Schluenzen et al., 2001, Zarivach et al., 2001,  Auerbach et al., 2002, Schluenzen et al., 2002), and revealed an internal two-fold symmetry within the active site. These led to a proposed mechanism of peptide-bond formation, including proton transfer mediated by water or hydrated magnesium (manuscript in preparation). This mechanism is consistent with earlier suggestion that the ribosome provides the frame for accurate orientation of the tRNA molecules rather than participating in the chemical enzymatic activity, as proposed by the Yale group (Nissen et al., 2000), and was widely challenged Analysis of the interactions of a dozen ribosomal antibiotics studied by us illuminated various modes of their action. Thus antibiotics inhibit protein biosynthesis by reducing the decoding accuracy, limiting conformational mobility, interference with substrate binding and hindrance of the progression of growing proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Pioletti et al., 2001</ref>, Schluenzen et al., 2001, Auerbach et al.,  2002). Our results shed light also on antibiotic selectivity and resistance. The uniqueness of our studies stems from the usage the ribosomes of an eubacterium resembling pathogens rather than ribosomes form archaea, used by the Yale group, which shares properties of eubacteria and eukaryotes. Hence our results rationalized a large volume of empiric observations, provided insight into resistance and paved the way for structural based drug design. Consequently, several pharmaceutical companies approached us and initiated collaborations or licensed our coordinates. Among these is Rib-X, the company founded recently by the Yale group.</p><p>The structures of both the large and the small ribosomal subunits determined by us contain all features involved in ribosomal activities, contrary to the 2.4 A structure of the halophilic large subunit determined by the Yale group, in which these structural elements are disordered. Comparisons of the structures determined by us with the lower resolution structure of the entire ribosome (Santa Cruz structure) identified flexible features and suggested possible ways for their function. These include how intersubunit bridges may be formed, how the tRNA molecules may exit the ribosome and how translocation can take place, major functional aspects of protein biosynthesis not seen before <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Harms et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Gluehmann et al, 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Yonath 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The site of peptide bond formation is adjacent to the entrance of a tunnel along which the nascent proteins progress until they emerge out of the ribosome. This tunnel was assumed to provide a passive path for exporting smoothly all protein sequences. However, recently it was suggested to be involved in elongation arrest. Consistent with these findings, our studies revealed the dynamic capabilities of the nascent protein exit tunnel and correlated it with elongation arrest and sequence discrimination (manuscript in preparation), thus providing the only structural insight for the participation of the ribosome in sub-cellular regulation.</p></div>
