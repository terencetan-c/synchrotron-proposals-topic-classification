The majority of presently available ferrofluids are based on the spinel-type ferrites (e.g., magnetite Fe 3 O 4 , maghemite Î³-Fe 2 O 3 , CoFe 2 O 4 , etc.) in the superparamagnetic state, featuring particles with approximately 10 nm in diameter. Recently in our lab we have developed a method for production of novel type of magnetic colloids based on disc-like hard magnetic hexaferrite (SrFe 12 O 19 ) particles [1, 2]. Since the hexaferrite (SrFe 12 O 19</p><p>) ferrofluids consist of single-domain magnetic particles with large magnetic moment their magnetic interaction should induce formation of spatially ordered structures. One of indirect evidences of such structuring is transition from a diluted "gas" phase to a "condensed liquid" phase in gradient magnetic field. Such spontaneous or field induced particle ordering hasn't been investigated yet.</p><p>In our experiment we have used SAXS technique to reveal colloid internal structure in constant and alternating magnetic field. For this purposes we have used specially designed measurement cell with two coils producing nearly uniform magnetic field. Field strength varied from 0 to 500 Oe for static fields. For AC measurements field strength amplitude was 30 Oe at number of frequencies <ref type="bibr">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr">28;</ref><ref type="bibr">56,</ref><ref type="bibr">56;</ref><ref type="bibr">112,</ref><ref type="bibr">11;</ref><ref type="bibr">224,</ref><ref type="bibr">24,</ref><ref type="bibr">336,</ref><ref type="bibr">36,</ref><ref type="bibr">400 and 500 Hz)</ref>. We have performed two types of AC measurements: integral imaging with relatively high acquisition times, corresponding to average state of the particles and time scan, illustrating the process of particles reorganization in the magnetic field.</p><p>During the experiment a set of samples containing different types of particles with various concentrations have been analyzed. Best results have been achieved for colloid solution containing aluminum substituted hexaferrite particles. It was presented in two forms: standard "gas" phase colloid and "condensed liquid" phase. "Liquid" phase was also mixed with glycerol for obtaining samples with different viscosity. A colloid solution of non-substituted hexaferrite particles, has also been investigated as a reference sample.</p><p>According to the results obtained standard "gas" state colloid has not shown any diffraction reflexes under DC magnetic field, but scattering intensity distribution seriously changed in the applied field. Such behavior corresponds to particles alignment in the applied magnetic field and form-factor intensity redistribution. Measurements in AC field gave qualitatively the same results, those would be used to extract kinetics of colloid particles reorganization.</p><p>Condensation process was studied in-situ during this experiment. Cuvette with "gas" state colloid was placed in a highly intensive (max. 1500 Oe) gradient magnetic field. Time scan in this case showed appearing of diffraction reflection at the q=0,233 nm -1 corresponding to the interparticle distance of ~27 nm. This value seriously exceeds particle width (~5 nm), indicating in-solution magnetic ordering of particles rather than their aggregation. Particles form thread-like columnar structures which are stabilized by the balance of electrostatic repulsion and magnetic attraction. Another significant part of the experiments was devoted to "condensed" phase colloid itself. Particularly to its structure determination and influence of pH changes as destabilizing factor.</p><p>According to the acquired data the phase consists of thread-like aggregates described above, resulting in much higher magnetic response but having rheological properties of liquid. SAXS measurements showed presence of these structures without applied magnetic field as circular diffraction reflection due to disorientation of the threads. Magnetic ordering of a condensed phase in DC field leads to appearance of two highly-intensive reflections (spatial ordering of single threads in the liquid), corresponding to interparticle distance in threads. AC measurements showed that threads are stable and could not be destroyed by high frequency field. Time scan in AC mode indicated periodical orientation-disorientation of the threads with field oscillations. One of the most exciting results obtained was concerned interparticle distance variation with the change of pH value in "condensed" state colloid. In "gas" state colloid such variation of pH value beyond stability region leads to fast particle aggregation and precipitation. In "condensed" state decrease of pH doesn't destabilize colloid but strongly influences on interparticle distance in threads (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Time scan of concentration front movement (AC field to show only freely rotating non-stuck particles) shows continuous decrease of interparticle distance. Direct mixing with 0,6% HCl also leads to the same results, but much faster. This implies a decisive role of electrostatic repulsion forces on platelets ordering and the interparticle distance. Further theoretical analysis and modelling will allow to give a model description of the observed effects.</p><p>[1] Trusov L.A., Vasiliev A.</p><p>V., et al.
