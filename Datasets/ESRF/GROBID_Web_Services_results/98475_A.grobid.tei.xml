<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim</head><p>Tantalum (Ta) is recognized as one of the so-called 'critical minerals', with wide applications in the electronics and green energy industry but limited supply chain. An understanding of the speciation and solubility of Ta in hydrothermal solutions is key in helping both Ta exploration and mineral processing. High-resolution X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) can reveal fine features of the XANES spectra, thus help identifying important Ta aqueous complexes (with O, F and Cl) that are hard to identify using conventional XAS detection techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Data were collected at the Ta L3-edge (9881 eV) at the BM-16 (FAME-UHD) beamline, using the high T-P autoclave developed by the Institut Neel. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Conditions Sample Conditions</head></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>indicate that Ta-salts in HCl have a structure that does not change much with temperature. Preliminary fits suggest that Sol5 and Sol8 can be fitted with 6xO at all T, T-O~1.82 to 1.85 Å (Sol5) &amp; Ta-O ~ 1.86 Å (Sol8). 2. Ta-salt in HF: The XANES spectra have a distinct change that occurs around 100-200 o C, depending on the HF concentration), however fits indicate ~8xF from 25 to 400 o C. This is consistent with the room temperature study of Wilson et al. (2015, DOI: 10.1002/ejic.201600981) that noted 7-8 fluorine coordinated to Ta in solutions containing 1-27 M HF; suggesting that the change in XANES could be related to the change from 7 to 8 fluorine ligands.</figDesc></figure>
