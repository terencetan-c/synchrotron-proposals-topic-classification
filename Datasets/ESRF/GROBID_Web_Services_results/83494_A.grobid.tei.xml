<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this experiment was to characterise our latest implementation of silicon micro-dosimeters fabricated using 3D sensor technology. The devices under test now include an integrated tissue-equivalent polymer. The tests are carried out at device level, in photoelectric mode, using a focused X-ray beam. This experiment has the main objective of finalising our understanding of the fabrication technology that was developed in the past 4 years within the framework of the Si-3DMiMic project, funded by the Norwegian Council for Research. The tests focused mostly on charge collection dynamics and timing response studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample description, experimental techniques and results:</head><p>The Devices Under Test (DUT) are solid-state micro-dosimeters fabricated on high-resistivity, p-type silicon (~10kΩcm). The starting material was a 10µm thick Silicon On Insulator (SOI) wafer. Each device has an active area of 2.4x2.4 mm 2 (physical size 4.8x4.8 mm 2 ). The active area is composed of 1056 independent sensitive volumes (configured in a 33x32 matrix). The sensitive cells are comparable in size to human cells and two radiuses were implemented (13.5 and 19 µm). The sensor layout is arranged in odd and even columns, readout at opposite sides of the device. Two cells are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a), they features a planar (n+) readout electrode in the middle (core) and a cylindrical 3D trench (p+) as biasing electrode. This configuration ensures that the Sensitive Volume (SV) within each cell, is physically separed from the rest of the substrate, thus achieving a perfect definintion of the charge collection region. The pitch between neighboring cells is equal to 75 µm. The excess silicon outside the cylindrical cells is removed and replaced with a tissue-equivalent polymer (polyimide, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(b)</ref>) necessary to mimic the interaction of radiation with the human body. Each die is glued and wire bonded to custom designed PCBs that fit the ID21 sample support (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>)), ensuring ease of use in the Scanning X-ray Microscope (SXM). The signals are readout using micro-coaxial cables from the back-side of the PCB. The connection to the instruments outside of the vacuum chamber is performed through a flange featuring hermetic SMA connectors (the inside of the vacuum chamber is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(d)</ref>). Two measurement modes where used: (i) with the use of Keithley 458 electrometers, the sensor response was recorded as a function of beam position and, (ii) with the use of 2.3GHz wide band preamplifiers and a Digital Sampling Oscilloscope (DSO) the time response of the sensors was acquired as function of time and beam position. Both 1D and 2D spatial scans were performed. An X-ray energy of 7.2 keV was used. The focused X-ray beam had a size of about 1.1x0.4 μm 2 and hit the sensors with a 30° tilt angle. Additional features of the SXM, such as X-ray fluorescence, allowed precise visualisation of different materials and elements in the sensor (e.g. the metal lines). The up-and down-stream beam intensity monitors were used to normalize the acquired data.</p><p>Results obtained using electrometer readout are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. A 1D scan is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a) for a wide range of bias voltages. The signal increases as more voltage is applied to the sensor, saturation is achieved at as low as 3V of bias. The FWHM of the signal was found to be between 35 and 40 µm, in accordance with the designed diameter of the cell. A decrease in signal amplitude in the middle of the cell can be noticed at higher voltages. This effect is caused by the presence of the deep n+ core implant and is accentuated at higher voltages. A 2D scan at a bias of 30V is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.(b) (plotted in arbitrary units). The uniformity and FWHM of the response are confirmed and no signal is observed in any of the regions outside the p+ deep trench, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating perfectly defined sensitive volumes. No bi-products of the interaction between X-rays and the tissue-equivalent polymer are detected. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(c) shows the overlay of the fluorescence signals for silicon (gray) and aluminium (orange). This measurement is important because it allows to appreciate the severe topography of the top sensor layer. This is an excellent, non-invasive diagnostic tool, and it highlighted some issues with the metal layer in these devices (broken metal lines were detected using this method, task that was difficult even using SEM imaging). The flurescence images and the data from a 2D scan are overlayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(d</ref>). This image shows how the 30 degree tilt of the beam results in a slight parallax effect, but it also shows that the signal is readout from the expected regions. Both 1D and 2D scans were repeated using a transimpedence amplifier connected to a DSO. The data acquisition was triggered using a signal sent by the synchrotron at each bunch. A current pulse function of time was acquired for each scan position. The data were then processed using a python script. Each pulse was integrated using the trapzoidal method within a rolling window moved in steps of 0.5 ns. The result of the integration is representative of the charge collected in each scan point. By plotting the carge collected in each interval covered by the rolling window, it was possible to show the collected charge as function of time (both in 1D and 2D). Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(a) shows the integration results over a 2D scan for a time of 2.5ns after the trigger, were the signal is at its maximum (Vbias=30V). After just 3ns (Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b</ref>)) most of the charge is already collected (signal decrease of more than 60%). This is also visible by observing the pulses extracted from the center of the cell (Fig. <ref type="figure">3(c)</ref>). For higher bias voltages, the signal exhibits a very rapid rise time and most of the charge is collected in the 5ns following the peak. Fig. <ref type="figure">3(c</ref>) allows to appreciate the effect of the bias voltage in increasing the response time of the sensor. These results demonstrate that the latest version of these solidstate microdosimeters is exceeding the performance of our benchmark technology (tested in the past years at ID21) in terms of sensitive volume definition and speed. These sensors are the most advanced solid-state micro-dosimeters and will now be tested in medical radiation facilities with protons and carbon ions. Fig. 3(a). Peak signal (2.5ns) Fig. 3(b).
