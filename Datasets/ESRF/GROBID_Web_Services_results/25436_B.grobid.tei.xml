<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Osteoporosis is a bone fragility disease characterized by a loss of bone mass and alteration in trabecular bone micro-architecture. Although lesss considered, cortical bone is also affected. Ultrasonic measurements are attracting the attention of a number of researchers, but the exact nature of measured architectural features is not clear. The LIP which has a long experience in ultrasound techniques recently proposed 1) a model to predict ultrasound backscatter coefficient using 3D images of micro-architecture of trabecular bone, 2) a method for assessing cortical shells of long bones using axial transmission.</p><p>In view to validate and optimize ultrasound measurements, the aim of this proposal was to acquire 3D images of a large number of trabecular and cortical samples to assess accurately the properties of bone samples in terms of architecture and degree of mineralization.</p><p>Fifty specimens of human femoral neck were extracted from cadavers, ("Banque du Don d'Organe", Université Paris 5) and defatted leaving only the inorganic network. Both cylindrical cores (diameter : 1 cm, thickness : 1 cm) from cortical and trabecular bone were prepared. All samples were placed in a plexiglas sample holder allowing a very fast manipulation of the samples during the experiment. Ultrasound measurements (by backscattering and axial transmission) were performed on the bone samples befor imaging.</p><p>The samples were imaged using SR µCT on beamline ID19 at ESRF in the following conditions : voxel size : 10µm, detector FRELON camera 1024x1024, exposure time : 0.5 sec. To optimize image contrast, the energy was adapted to each series of samples, and was set to 24 Kev for trabecular sample, and 26 Kev for cortical samples. A total of 81 samples were acquired. Volumes of interest of 800 x 800 x 1024 voxels were selected and reconstructed using the filtered back projection algorithm.</p><p>Typical 3D displays are presented in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (a: cortical bone and b : trabecular bone). The 3D-images are currently under image analysis for extracting both parameters of bone micro-architecture and bone mineralization. Note that the analysis has to be adapted to the type of bone (trabecular or cortical).</p><p>Future works are the following : 1) concerning trabecular bone : the micro-architecture parameters obtained from SR µCT will be compared to those estimated from ultrasonic measurements using the specific model developed at the LIP. This should allow to validate and improve the ultrasound backscatter model.</p><p>2) concerning cortical bone : the morphometric parameters obrained from the SR µCT images, and more precisely the cortical thickness, the true bone mineral density and the porosity will be correlated to the ultrasound measurements. It will therefore allows to clarify the nature of the properties being measured by axial transmission technique.</p><p>3) To 3-D images will be used to simulate virtual osteoporosis in order to assess the sensitivity and potential of the different ultrasound methods to monitor osteoporosis and anti-osteoporosis drugs.</p></div>			</div>
