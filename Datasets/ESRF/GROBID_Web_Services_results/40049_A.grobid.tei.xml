<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The premise of this proposal was to probe the 6d conduction band polarisation of uranium, using XMCD at the U L 2,3 edges. This represents a new venture, both from a materials point of view; this would be the first detection of the uranium 6d states, using XMCD, but also from a technique point of view; the high energies of the U L edges (17.195 keV and 21.000 keV, respectively) represent the upper limit for the reliable detection of XMCD.</p><p>In the initial proposal, a series of multilayer samples was suggested as the both a means for detecting the 6d states and also to enhance our understanding of the mechanism of induced magnetism in such systems. However, we decided that it would be more prudent to accurately determine the origin of any observable dichroism at the U L edges, by investigating a very well-understood uranium ferromagnet. We mounted a U 0.9 La 0.1 S single crystal (practically identical physics to the pure US compound) with its [001] axis oriented along the beam direction, parallel to the applied magnetic field. U 0.9 La 0.1 S has a T C of 160 K and a [111] easy axis of magnetisation.</p><p>Many other techniques have been used over the past thirty or so years to well-characterise the moment values for both the 5f magnetic states and also those of the 6d conduction band, which lie antiparallel to the 5f. So, we set about probing both the 5f and 6d states, using the U M 4,5 edges (3.728 and 3.552 keV, respectively) and the U L 2,3 edges. Firstly, the sample was cooled, using the He flow cold finger system, mounted inside the 6T cryomagnet in hutch 1.</p><p>The energy was tuned to the U M 4 edge and the XMCD signal was measured as a function of temperature (see fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) in order to determine the maximum in the susceptibility (since the easy axis was along <ref type="bibr">[111]</ref> with the field applied along [001]). The maximum in this case was found at 140 K. An element specific hysteresis was then measured in order to determine the applied field required for magnetic saturation, shown in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The hysteresis loop shows that the saturation field is approx. 6 kOe. At this low field at was possible to flip the field at each measurement point in order to measure the XMCD and then reverse the helicity of the beam and repeat, detecting any artefacts not reversed in an applied field (linear dichroic effects/diffraction peaks etc.).The XANES and XMCD signals at the U M 4,5 edges are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, not corrected for self absorption or for polarisation rate.</p><p>The U M edges were measured having zero-field cooled (ZFC) the sample to 140 K, using the helios II undulator, using a Si photodiode in backscattering, through a Be window. We also attempted to measure the M 1,2,3 edges in order to probe the 6d electrons, but the edges were not strong enough to be well-resolved above the background.</p><p>In order to probe the 6d states, we moved to the U-32 undulator; we optimised the monochromator first at the at the 3 rd harmonic for the U L 3 edge (17.195 keV) and then at the 4 th harmonic for the L 2 (21.000 keV). The sample was held at 140 K and a field of 6 kOe was flipped as a function of energy over the absorption edges.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows the XANES and XMCD signals without self-absorption or polarisation (should be ~100% circular polarisation, CP) correction.</p><p>Initial analysis indicates that the observable signals at the U L 2,3 edges may not be entirely dipole in nature. In fact, a large contribution may come from the quadrupolar transitions. This can be seen by the maximum in the dichroic signal centred ~10eV below the peak in the white line. A more detailed, quantitative analysis will follow, outlining the first report of XMCD at the U L edges.
