<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This experiment aimed at exploring the stability of ordered arrays of supported tiny Pt clusters under pre-catalytic conditions (i.e. exposed to low pressures of O 2 , CO, CO+O 2 and increasing temperature). We previously showed that Pt clusters organize on a template consisting of a thin alumina film on Ni 3 Al(111) with a density 3 or 9 times higher than palladium, depending on the growth conditions. These tailored ordered arrays open the way to explore the emerging topic of single-atom catalysis by using surface science techniques in order to understand the link between atomic-scale properties and catalytic performance. In this experimental session, we performed GISAXS to in situ monitor the Pt clusters' growth and their stability. We explored various conditions of substrate's temperature and gas atmosphere (mainly CO). We were able to i) estimate the stability of very tiny Pt clusters with respect to temperature, CO (or CO + O2) pressure, ii) establish the growth conditions to stabilize the Pt clusters on the dot structure (organization only observed for Pd clusters) and iii) study the Pt diffusion process as a function of the experimental conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2/ Experimental results</head><p>The lattice mismatch between the Al2O3 ultra-thin film and the Ni3Al(111) substrate yields two surface superstructures designated as dot (lattice parameter of 4.1 nm) and network structures (2.4 nm lattice parameter, rotated by 30° regarding the dot structure). Palladium atoms self-organize on the dot structure forming nice and almost perfect two-dimensional hexagonal cluster arrays with a narrow size distribution, whereas vanadium atoms self-organize on the network structure. The possibility of growing such ordered arrays with various metals is important for fields such as magnetism and catalysis in order to better understand the macroscopic properties. But the organization is usually poor, except when Pd is used as seeds on the dot structure.</p><p>In a previous experiment (Experiment 20160416; results published in Sitja et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 123 (2019) 24487-24494; DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b05109), we showed that, at room temperature, very small Pt deposits are organized on a new superstructure, 9 times denser than the dot structure.</p><p>In a first part of this experiment, we mainly focused on very small Pt deposits of 0.05 equivalent monolayer (eq. ML). The organization on the new dense sub-structure is highlighted by the presence of only one sharp scattering rod at Q// = 5.28 nm -1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Such deposits were heated up to 200 °C (and even 400 °C for some of them). We observed that the organization is fairly good up to ~ 180-190 °C and that a low oxygen pressure (5.10 -8 mbar) does not have a strong effect on the organization quality (images not shown). We also manage to organize the Pt clusters on the dot structure. As said, this was previously achieved only by seeding the surface with Pd atoms, prior to Pt deposition. Here, by playing with substrate's temperature and CO pressure, we were able to obtain a very good spatial organization, highlighted by the presence of four rods of diffraction corresponding to the (10), ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>) reflections of the hexagonal dot structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).  <ref type="formula">10</ref>), ( <ref type="formula">20</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">30</ref>) diffraction rods arising from clusters organized on the dot structure (left) and ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) diffraction rod (right).</p><p>Lastly, thicker Pt deposits done at higher temperature (300 -400 °C) were also studied (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). After deposition, the (11) rod appears to be much more intense than the (30) one, pointing to an organization on the network structure (or on the dense one, with a modulation of atoms position along the z direction; simulations needed). The diffuse scattering around the (10) position is intensified after heating up to 300 °C, indicating a clear cluster coalescence. We finally showed that the Pt adatom surface diffusion is strongly altered when the surface is kept for several hours in UHV before Pt deposition (images not shown).</p><p>These partial results and initial conclusions are very encouraging. They must be confirmed by simulations and will be published as soon as possible.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1-GISAXS image recorded for a 0.05 ML Pt deposit (done at 110 °C).
