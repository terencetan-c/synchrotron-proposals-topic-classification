<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific Background</head><p>Atmospheric aerosol is a suspension of solid or liquid particles in the atmosphere. Its chemical composition is very variable and depends on sources (natural or anthropogenic) and on atmospheric processing (ageing and mixing). Aerosol physico-chemical properties such as mass and number concentration, size distribution, chemical composition and mineralogy influence its impact on visibility, climate and human health. XAS techniques have been recently applied to aerosol samples in order to determine local order and valence state of iron in suspended particulate matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> , but a characterization of Fe-bearing aerosol sources is auspicable to better understand the pure aerosols' characteristics and put down the basis for a detailed understanding of mixed aerosol types. The aim of this experimental session was the investigation of iron speciation in steel production emission fumes, sampled in the chimney stacks of the ThyssenKrupp -Acciai Speciali Terni (TK-AST) plant located in the Terni city (Central Italy). Steel production emissions consists mainly in iron spinels where the Fe atoms can be substituted by other metals (such as Cr, Ni or Mn) present in the welding matrices. These compounds are poorly soluble so iron is less bioavailable with respect to that included in the alluminosilicatic matrix of Saharan dust.</p><p>Experimental details, measurement strategy XAS (XANES and EXAFS) spectra at the Fe (7112 eV), Cr (5989 eV), and Mn (6539 eV) kedge have been collected at the CRG-LISA beamline (BM08). Spectra have been recorded at room temperature in moderate vacuum conditions. Three scans per sample have been recorded in fluorescence mode, in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. However, no evidence of beam damage was found by comparing the first and the last spectrum. For each sample, it has also been recorded the transmission spectrum of a reference (metallic Fe or Mn foil) in order to provide internal energy calibration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples details</head><p>Aerosol samples were collected inside the chimney stacks of the TK-AST steel production plant in Terni. The four investigated samples correspond to two smelters and two converters of the plant. The sample collected at the rural regional background station of Monte Martano <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> on December 1 st 2014 during an extremely intense Saharan dust outbreak and analysed in the 08-01-999 experiment at the Fe k-edge, was analysed at the Mn k-edge. The mixed urban Saharan sample collected at the urban station of Borgo Rivo in Terni on the same day was investigated at the Fe k-edge. All the samples were collected on quartz fiber filters (Whatman QM 47mm) and the filter spectrum was recorded for every metal in order to evaluate its contribution to the samples, which resulted always negligible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results obtained</head><p>During the experimental session at the CRG-LISA beamline we measured the four samples of steel production fumes at Fe, Mn and Cr k-edges. The four spectra are very similar to each other suggesting the same local order for the three metals in every part of the plant. The differences we observed in the chemical characterization of the four samples are not evident in the XAS analysis.</p><p>As shown in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>, the spectra quality is better for the more loaded filters (E45 and E52) and it decreases for the less loaded ones. These differences are far less evident in the Fe spectra (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). As regards Fe, the AST spectra are very similar to that of magnetite and preliminary fitting tests show that it can be reproduced using both the tetrahedral and the octahedral magnetite paths. Marked differences are evident between the AST and the urban sample, which is very similar to that of Saharan dust recorded during the 08-01-999 experiment. The Cr spectra of the four samples are very similar. Cr 3+ should substitute Fe 3+ in the spinel structure, this will be investigated in detail together with the possible presence of Cr 6+ . Regarding Mn, remarkable differences between the AST and the Saharan dust samples are eyecatching; the first show an oscillatory structure that suggests the interaction with other 3d metals, while in the latter we can recognize only a first shell interaction. For the AST samples, the hypothesis of Mn 2+ substituting Fe 2+ in octahedral sites will be tested.</p><p>Quantitative fitting of the pre-edge features and of the EXAFS part of the spectrum with specific codes (Athena and Artemis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> ) is actually in progress.
