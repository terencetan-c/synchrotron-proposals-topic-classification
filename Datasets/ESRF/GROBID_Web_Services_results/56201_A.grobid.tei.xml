<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The speciation of a metal solute in a solvent is crucial to its dissolution and potential performance in many applications, e.g. catalysis. We investigated the effect of the anions on the speciation of a metal cation solute using NEXAFS spectroscopy for a carefully-selected series of transition metal (TM) salts in ionic liquid solvents.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref> shows four solutions where only one anion was present in solution, as both the ionic liquid and the metal salt contain the same anion, e.g.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Co[SCN] 2 and [C 4 C 1 Im][SCN]</formula><p>. Therefore, for these four solutions it is known which anion complexes to the Co 2+ . Consequently, these four solutions represent fingerprint reference NEXAFS spectra for the cobalt complexes in solution.</p><p>These fingerprint NEXAFS spectra are generally very distinct for different metal complexes. The most important feature is the pre-edge peak at ~7701.8 eV, which results from excitation to molecular orbitals with primarily d-type character (with some p-character</p><p>). Pre-edge transitions are forbidden if the cobalt atom is in a centrosymmetric environment; symmetry prevents d and p orbital mixing, and transitions to a purely d-type orbital are forbidden. Therefore the presence of a pre-edge peak suggests that [CoCl 4 ] 2-, [CoBr 4 ] 2-and [Co(NCS) 4 ] 2-complexes are non-centrosymmetric, and therefore most likely tetrahedral. For [CoCl 4 ] 2-this finding is in agreement with UV spectra 1 and Co 1s NEXAFS spectra 2 . Co[Tf 2 N] 2 dissolved in [C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N] did not show a significant pre-edge peak at ~7701.8 eV (Figure 3a). Therefore, Co[Tf 2 N] 2 dissolved in [C 8 C 1 Im][Tf 2 N] forms a centrosymmetric octahedral complex in solution, strongly suggesting that the metal complex in solution is [Co(Tf 2 N) 3 ] -. NEXAFS spectra for [CoBr 4 ] 2-in solution and [CoCl 4 ] 2-in solution were similar in both shape and edge energy (Figure 1b). For the solution x = 0.20 CoCl 2 dissolved in [C 8 C 1 Im]Br, the anion formed could be [CoBr 4 ] 2-, [CoCl 4 ] 2-or a mixture of Br and Cl ligands. Clearly, the Co 1s NEXAFS spectra cannot be used to determine ligand competition between Cl and Br (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>). It also appears that different x do not significantly impact upon the shape of the NEXAFS spectra, at least for halide ligands. (1) S. <ref type="bibr">Schaltin et al., Electrochem.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Co[Tf 2 N] 2 dissolved in [C 8 C 1 Im]Br showed a very similar NEXAFS spectrum to the NEXAFS spectrum for [CoBr 4 ] 2-in solution, and a very different NEXAFS spectrum to the NEXAFS spectrum for [Co(Tf 2 N) 3 ] -in solution (Figure 1c); most importantly, there was no pre-edge peak for Co[Tf 2 N] 2 dissolved in [C 8 C 1 Im]Br. Therefore, we can conclude that Co[Tf 2 N] 2 dissolved in [C 8 C 1 Im]Br formed [CoBr 4 ] 2-in solution, with free [Tf 2 N] -anions. Therefore, Br -complexes more strongly to Co 2+ than [Tf 2 N] -. NEXAFS spectra for either CoCl 2 or Co[NTf 2 ] 2 dissolved in [C 4 C 1 Im][SCN] (x=0.2) were very similar, in both shapes and edge energies, to the NEXAFS spectrum for [Co(NCS) 4 ] 2-in solution (Figure 1d). Therefore, [SCN] -complexes more strongly to Co 2+ than [Tf 2 N] -, and [SCN] -complexes more strongly to Co 2+ than Cl -.</figDesc></figure>
