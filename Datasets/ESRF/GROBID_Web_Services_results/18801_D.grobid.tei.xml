HCV has infected an estimated 3% of the world population and current therapies are effective only in a small number of cases. Current research is focused on developing HCV-specific antiviral agents to counteract this disease. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of HCV is responsible for replication of the viral genome and thus has become an important target in this quest for specific antivirals. Using data collected at the Synchrotron (previous bag) we have determined the structures of the RdRp of HCV (lacking the 55 C-terminus residues) without and in the presence of the catalytic metal ion, one structure with Mg2+ and one with Mn2+ . Also using data collected during the previous bag we determined the structures of GB virus B (GBV-B) polymerase alone and bound to two small molecular inhibitors. The GBV-B virus belongs to the same viral family of HCV, Flaviviridae, and infects small primates (Sanguinus sp. <ref type="bibr">[tamarins]</ref>) and shows similarities to hepatitis C virus (HCV) in genome organization, protein function, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity. This suggests the possibility of using tamarins infected by GBV-B or GBV-B/HCV chimeric viruses as a surrogate animal model of HCV infection. ∆C55 polymerase structure previously obtained by us, P212121. This structure has been refined to an Rfactor of 22.9% (Rfree 24%) and the electron density map and the difference map were carefully analyzed. Despite the change in the space group, no RNA seems to be visible in the electron density map. One metal ion (Mg2+) is present close to Asp220, Thr 221, Asp318 and a water molecule. Some extra density is present between Asp220 and Asp319, which likely accounts for another metal ion. Further model building/refinement was stopped. For the future, we intend to try soaking with smaller RNAs.</p><p>Table 1 Crystallographic Data Collection Statistics Unit cell parameters (Å) a = 66.823 b = 95.859 c = 97.004 α ? = β=γ = 90 Space group P21212 Resolution range (Å) 20 -1.9 No. reflections measured 182,892 No. unique reflections 42,822 completeness (%) 86.5 (81.3) R merge (%) 6.6 (16.7) I I σ 11.2 (8.7) CONFIDENTIAL, ONLY FOR REVIEW PURPOSES</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>S</head><figDesc>Su ub b--d do om ma ai in ns s P PA AL LM M I In nh hi ib bi it to or r b bi in nd di in ng g s si it te e F FI IN NG GE ER RS S T TH HU UM MB B F FI IN NG GE ER R T TI IP PS S p pa al lm m/ /f fi in ng ge er rs s 2 2 α α--h he el li ix x l li in nk ke er r C C--t te er rm mi in nu us s C Ca ar rt to oo on n R Re ep pr re es se en nt ta at ti io on n In order to have the structure of the polymerase in complex with the nucleic acid (RNA), crystals of ∆C55 Polymerase soaked in the presence of Mg2+ and an RNA aptamer were measured during this beamtime together with VH crystals described in a separate report .
