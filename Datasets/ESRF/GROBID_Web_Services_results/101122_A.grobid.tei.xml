The microstructure of each powder batch consists of a matrix with an FCC structure and between 50 vol.% and 70 vol.% of γ' precipitate with an ordered FCC_L12 structure. The goal of the experiment conducted at the ESRF was to measure the lattice parameters of the γ and the γ' phases as a function of the temperature during a heat/cool cycle between room temperature and 871 °C that is supposed to mimic a typical aging cycle in manufacturing conditions. We are planning to use the data to calculate the crystallographic misfit between the two phases and correlate it with 3D printing trials that we are currently performing.Before the experiment, 0.5 mm quartz capillaries were filled with powder, sealed under nitrogen atmosphere, and prepared for analysis. A hot blower was used to heat up the samples between room temperature and 871 °C and back to room temperature. XRD signal was continuously collected during the heat/cool cycle but the temperature was stabilized at predetermined steps (260 °C, 538 °C and 871 °C) to collect more signal. The entire heat/cool cycle was repeated three times with different heating/cooling rates: slow heat/rapid cool, slow heat/slow cool and finally rapid heat/slow cool. All seven batches of powder were exposed to the same heat/cool cycles.The major output of the experiment is a series of diffraction patterns. Figure1is an example of the intensity of X-rays scattered as a function of the 2θ angle. Major peaks correspond to the γ and γ' phases and their position was used to calculate the lattice parameters. Other minor peaks correspond to second phases such as carbides or Laves phase but are yet to be fully indexed. In the example in Figure1, the γ/γ' misfit is derived from the lattice parameters aγ = 3.6396 Å and aγ = 3.6422 Å giving a misfit of δ = 0.073 %, calculated as follows:𝜹𝜹 = 𝟐𝟐 × (𝒂𝒂 𝜸𝜸′ -𝒂𝒂 𝜸𝜸 ) (𝒂𝒂 𝜸𝜸′ + 𝒂𝒂 𝜸𝜸 )Part of the results will be published in a paper on cracking mitigation during the design of high γ' superalloys for additive manufacturing to be submitted to the journal Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A. The bulk of the results will be submitted to the TMS Superalloys 2024 conference and published in the proceedings in September 2024.</figDesc></figure>
