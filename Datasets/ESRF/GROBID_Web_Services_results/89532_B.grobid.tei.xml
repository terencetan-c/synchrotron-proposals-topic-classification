<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Measurements at the Ce K-edge were performed first, using the 12-element Ge solid state detector available at SNBL for fluorescence detection. From a study on the transformation of engineered CeO 2 nanoparticles in sewage sludge before and after incineration, digested sewage sludge and incinerated sewage sludge ash with Ce contents of 2000 and 4000 mg/kg, respectively, were analyzed; as well as a series of reference materials.</p><p>A second set of samples consisted of solutions containing humic acids at different pH values that were spiked with 500 mg/L Ce(III) to assess the extent of Ce(III) complexation or Ce(III)-to-Ce(IV) oxidation by the humic acid. By adjusting the sample length accordingly (4-5 cm tubes in the case of the sewage sludge and sewage sludge ash; 12-cm tubes in the case of the humic acid samples), even the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the dilute samples could be measured in transmission mode. Comparison with the corresponding fluorescence spectra showed that measurements in transmission mode were of superior quality even at the lowest analyzed Ce concentrations, thanks to data integration over relatively large sample thicknessess at the high energy of the Ce K-edge (40'443 eV). For lower concentrations than the ones tested here, however, fluorescence detection would have become mandatory. The results from these test measurements are planned to be included in two publications.</p><p>After switching to the Tl L III -edge, the 12-element Ge detector stopped working after one sample due to vacuum problems, and further tests had to be performed with the 1-element silicon drift detector (SDD). For testing, we collected data on 3 layered Mn-oxides spiked with Tl at loadings of 30'000 mg/kg, 10'000 mg/kg and 3'000 mg/kg; and on two waste materials from a Zn smelter with Tl contents of 10'000 and 3'000 mg/kg Tl. At the lowest concentrations of 3'000 mg/kg Tl, the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra measured in transmission mode were still interpretable, whereas the EXAFS signal became too noisy.</p><p>However, the transmission data were were less noisy than the fluorescence data recorded with the 1-element SDD. Thus, for analyses at the Tl L III -edge at lower concentrations in fluorescence mode, a sensitive multielement fluorescence detector would be needed. The results obtained at the Tl L III -edge served to refine experiments on the interaction of Tl with Mn-oxides that involve synchrotron analyses.</p><p>In conclusion, the test experiments revealed the very high potential of BM31 for environmental XAS analyses at high energies, where even relatively low trace element contents can be analyzed in transmission mode. However, for experiments at lower concentrations (as often encountered in environmental samples), XAS measurements must be performed in fluorescence mode using a sensitive multielement fluorescence detector.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>The aim of this experiment was to analyse environmental samples containing Ce or Tl at different concentratins in different matrices by Ce K-edge (40'443 eV) and Tl L III -edge (12'658 eV) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to gain information on the possibilities at BM31 with respect to the study of trace elements in dilute environmental samples.</figDesc></figure>
