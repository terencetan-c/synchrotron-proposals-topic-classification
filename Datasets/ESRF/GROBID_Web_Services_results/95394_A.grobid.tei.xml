<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We implemented submicron X-ray focusing (down to several hundred nanometers) using a single-bounce ellipsoidal capillary illuminated by a ring-shaped beam produced by parabolic axicon based optical system. The optical properties of the submicron X-ray focusing technique have been studied experimentally at the ID06 ESRF beamline et the X-ray energy of 12.4 keV.</p><p>Used single-bounce ellipsoidal capillary represents a micromirror with the minor axis equal to 50 µm and major axes of 95 mm. The ellipsoidal capillary has an entrance diameter of 50 µm, and an output diameter of 8 µm providing a working distance of about 1 mm. The capillary was placed on the stage with all necessary translations and rotations at 54 m distance from the source.</p><p>First, we used the compound refractive lenses (CRL consist of Al lenses with R of 50 µm) with focal distance of about 1 m to focus X-rays at the first ellipse focus. In this case, only a small edge area of the inner surface of the capillary close to its exit was illuminated. The reduced image of the focal spot was observed at the second focus. However, the scattering at the edge of the capillary bore resulted in a broadening of the focal spot. Besides, a direct beam from the first focus passing through the capillary opening without being reflected increased the background.</p><p>To eliminate the influence of the direct beam background and scattering at the edge of the capillary bore, we used an off-axis ring-type illumination. Such a special form of the beam was generated by axicon based optical system consisted of parabolic axicon lenses and traditional parabolic focusing lenses. This made it possible to flexibly adjust the size of the focused ring-shaped beam produced by axicons changing the number of the parabolic lenses in the optical system. It was shown that the diameter of the annular beam decreased with the increase in the number of lenses. The combination of 3 axicons with 5 aluminum parabolic lenses made it possible to achieve an acceptable size of a focused annular beam of about 11 μm (diameter). In this case, it was the annular section of the capillary surface that reflected X-rays to the second focus.</p><p>The test of the elliptical capillary has resulted in focusing about 2 µm FWHM for a flat parallel beam, about 1 µm FWHM for combined capillary with the CRL focused at the first ellipse focus. We were able to obtain focusing about 500 nm FWHM, taking advantage of the ring-shaped beam generated by the axicon based optical system. Due to the annular illumination of the capillary surface the influence of the scattering at the edge of the capillary bore was excluded. The overall gain of the two-step focusing system was three orders higher compared with a flat monochromatic beam. Applying the axicon based optical system, a flux enhancement by almost a factor of three in comparison with the CRL focused at the first ellipse focus was measured.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>email: detlefs@esrf.fr ) ID06 Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr Dmitrii Zverev (Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University) Dr Irina Sniguirev (ESRF) Dr Anatoly Sniguirev (Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University)</figDesc></figure>
