<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Following results were achieved from data collected during MX-1758: Data were collected of several fimbrial proteins (Mfa1, Mfa2 and Mfa3) from the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. Data from SeMet labelled crystals of Mfa1, the main fimbrial protein, were collected to 1.8 Å and the structure was solved. Native data were also collected.</p><p>Native data to 1.9 Å from the accessory protein Mfa3 were collected. (The structure was previously solved using Bromide SAD from data collected at beam time MX-1705).</p><p>Data of the accessory protein Mfa2 were collected to 2.5 Å.</p><p>Data of the SeMet labelled adhesin domain of the Streptococcus pyogenes surface protein AspA, were collected to 2.0 Å and the structure was determined.</p><p>Approximately 22 high resolution data sets between 1.9-2.4 Å resolution were collected and structures solved of the Listeria master regulatory transcription factor PrfA in complex with various virulens inhibitors. Manuscript in preparation. A number of crystals of different RNA constructs containing the conserved and essential Dengue virus promoter have been evaluated on the beam line ID 29 (MX-1705). So far, none of the collected data sets was of quality high enough for structure solving. However, analysis of the different crystals and data sets clearly allowed us to identify the most promising constructs which we are currently optimizing to yield better diffracting crystals.</p><p>In addition 13 data sets diffracting between 1.6 -2 Å were collected from crystals of DmpR, a ATP dependent transcription factor from P. aeruginosa belonging to the AAA+ family. Crystals of DmpR contained different ATP analogues. About 8 data sets to about 2 Å resolution were collected from crystals of AnPrx6, a peroxiredoxin from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 in different oxidation states (manuscript in preparation). Four test data sets (2.5 -3.0 Å resolution) were collected from crystals containing a truncated filamentous protein FilP.</p></div>			</div>
