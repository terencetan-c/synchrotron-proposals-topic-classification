<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experiment was aimed at continuing our studies of fast 90" switching of the magnetisation during coherent nuclear excitation by synchrotron radiation (SR) <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. In particular, it was intended to improve the conditions of the initial switching off and the later recovery of the coherent scattering by a new switching geometry, where instead of transverse switching with respect t,o t,he beam [2] the magnetisation was switched into a direction almost along the beam. In addition, the switching was now to be performed by two alternating, mutually perpendicular magnetisation signals, where one wa.s produced by a small coil, and for steric reasons the other by a stripeline. The different geometry and the different switching mode required a new magnetisation cell and new pulse electronics.</p><p>The time dependences of the perturbed nuclear scattering in the X-ray allowed Bragg geometry reflection (222) of a perfect single crystal of 57FeB03 were measured. At the arrival of the SR flash, the crystal was magnetized in the way that only the nuclear am=0 transitions were excited. At, time t,l aft,er the excitation the magnet,isation was switched by 90" into the longitudinal direction. 11ftt.r a pulse duration T the magnetisation was switched back. The time spectra of the Bragg reflection wcrc studied as a function of tl and T. The analysis of the experimental results by means of a new computer programme developed for t,hat purpose [3] t'll IS s 1 under way. In the following we shall give prelimina.ry results only.</p><p>The alternating switching worked satisfa.ctorily. The change to the longitudinal switching geometry essentially improved the suppression of t.he integral scattered intensit,y during time T (IpT ). yielding now a reduction of Ip~with respect to the unperturbed intensity in the same t,ime window (loT) by almost a factor of 10. In the scattered intensity after switching back (Ip~(t)) well resolved Am=0 quantum beats were observed (compare Fig. <ref type="figure">l</ref>), d emonstrating the high quality of the switching process. In the course of the experiment, however, the crystal was obviously getting stressed due to heating by the magnetisation currents. The rocking curve width increased from initial 4" to final lo", and t,he reduction factor Io~/IP~ decreased from about 10 to 4.</p><p>For the determination of the optimal position of the first switching point the dependence of J,T on t,, was measured. In analogy to previous results [1,2] 't 1 was expected to find minima of J,T, when the magmetisation is switched at the times of the minima of the quantum beat with period of about 14 ns. By contrast, the observed first three minima were separated by about 7 ns only. This important result is not yet understood.</p><p>For the study of the dependence of I&amp;t) on the pulse length 'I?. the first switching was fixed at that time t1 which corresponded to the second, most pronounced minimum of lpT. The integral scattering after switching back (Ipa), normalized to the total intensity of the unperpurbed spectrum (I,), was found to decrease with a natural decay law. thus confirming the main result of [2]. This time, however, a pronounced oscillatory dependence of IiiB on the pulse length T was observed (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The modulation period increased with pulse duration T, because the heat load of the stripe line was increasing. leading to a rise of the crystal temperature and a corresponding reduction of the hyperfine splitting. The rise in temperature with T was independently regist~ered by means of unperturbed spectra. which were measured alternatingly each second SR pulse. The observed modulation is in principle expected from n necessary periodicity in the rearrangement of the excitation currents after switching forth and back, and it was also predicted by the theoretical calculations [3]. However, it was not yet. possible to give a detailed interpretation of this effect, in particular to establish a satisfactory relation between the modulation period of about 30 ns and the hyperfine splitting. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>/l/ Yu.V.
