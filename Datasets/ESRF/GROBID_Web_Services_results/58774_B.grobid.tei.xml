<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of the experiment was to perform Cu-L3 Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) measurements of the charge density wave (CDW) in the electron-doped cuprate Nd2-xCexCuO4 (NCCO). The primary question regarded the nature of the CDW in electron-doped cuprates: is the CDW purely elastic or does it have inelastic spectral features? We measured two NCCO samples, x = 0.106, x = 0.145, and constructed energy-momentum RIXS intensity maps focusing around the CDW momentum transfer, QCDW. The spectrometer was set to its highest back scattering geometry (2θ=149.5°). Different values of the inplane momentum transfer along the Cu-O bond diretion (H in reciprocal lattice units) were accessed by rotating the sample about an axis perpendicular to the scattering plane, i.e. to different θ angles (rocking curves). At each θ we measured the spectrum for several minutes, with the beamline and spectrometer conditions optimized for an energy resolution of ~ 60 meV. Prior to the acquisition of a set of spectra on the sample, we measured the spectrum on a thin layer of silver paint (located on the sample surface) to obtain the pixel location of the zero energy loss on the CCD camera detector.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref> shows the detailed energymomentum structure of the low-energy collective excitations of an underdoped nonsuperconducting NCCO sample (x = 0.106) at 25 K. With this RIXS geometry (forward scattering, H&lt;0, and incoming sigma polarization), the broad dispersive modes in the mid-infra-red (150 &lt; E &lt; 900 meV, MIR) region, usually associated with magnetic (paramagnon) fluctuations [1], show a clear coupling to the CDW. This is manifest in the data of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> as a dispersion anomaly near QCDW and as a distinct inelastic component (60 &lt; E &lt; 150 meV), marked by the white arrow in  Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>. Comparing this low-temperature measurement to its counterpart at 300K (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) we find that these two inelastic features are mostly suppressed at high temperatures, as expected. Furthermore, the temperature dependence also shows a build-up of spectral weight of the inelastic MIR modes at QCDW. A similar inelastic structure near the QCDW structure is also observed in measurements of the same sample for H &gt; 0, and it is confirmed in measurements performed at 25K on a superconducting NCCO sample (x = 0.145) for σand πgeometry (not shown).</p><p>To decompose the different elastic and inelastic contributions at QCDW, we separate the RIXS spectrum into different energy regions and we build energy-integrated H distribution curves for each of them. We emphasize that in the following analysis we integrated very specific energy regions that we determined from the inelastic spectrum. This analysis could not be done with data from a REXS experiment. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref> shows the signal integrated over all measurable energies (blue curve). The ratio of the CDW peak to the total signal (~ 1%), as well as the overall shape of the fluorescence background, greatly resemble previous REXS measurements <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. However, the momentum distribution curve obtained integrating the RIXS spectra in the 0.9 eV to 10 eV range shows the absence of any CDW peak in that energy region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref>, magenta). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2b</ref> we decompose the CDW signal (present for -60 &lt; E &lt; 900 meV) into quasi-elastic (-60 &lt; E &lt; 60 meV), lowenergy inelastic (60 &lt; E &lt; 150 meV), and MIR (150 &lt; E &lt; 900 meV) contributions. The most important outcome of this decomposition is that half of the CDW signal comes from inelastic excitations, therefore achieving the primary goal of the experiment. The inelastic component of the CDW (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2c</ref>) is confirmed by measurements of NCCO samples with two different dopings (0.106 and 0.145) and four scattering geometries (σ, π polarizations for ±H). Finally, our analysis also shows a non-trivial temperature dependence of the quasi-elastic and inelastic CDW signals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). In particular, note that while the quasi-elastic CDW is completely suppressed at 300K, the MIR component still shows a distinct maximum near QCDW.</p><p>We conclude by mentioning that further temperature-dependent data may be required to clarify this behavior whereas fully-polarimetric measurements, which resolve the polarization of the scattered photons, will be needed to understand the nature of the CDW-related MIR signal (charge or spin excitations). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 -</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 -RIXS signal integrated over different energy ranges following the description in the text.
