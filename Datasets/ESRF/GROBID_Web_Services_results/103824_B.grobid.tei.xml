<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Cost efficient and long-term stable catalysts are in great demand for the CO2 hydrogenation to methane (Sabatier reaction), a key process involved in conversion of CO2 into useful chemicals and fuels. Recently we prepared Ni-doped ceria nanoparticles 3.5 times more active than conventional Ni-supported on ceria. We then proposed to investigate by combined DRIFT/XAFS two Ni/CeO2 samples under reaction conditions. The experiment started with the challenging allignment of the DRIFT and XAFS set-up which we succesfully reached in 1 shift. Due to the low Ni content Ni K-edge XAFS spectra were collected in fluorescence mode. Hence a fluoscence detector was installed within the DRIFT set-up, demonstrating the high potentiality of the employed set-up. Ni K-edge XAFS and DRIFT spectra were collected during the following protocol : I) RT, He, II) heat (5C/min) to 400C under O2 (20%)/He mixture and steady state at 400C for 30'. III) Cooling to 100C followed by heating to 400C under H2 (20%)/He mixture and steady state at 400C for 30'. IV) Cooling to 230C where the reaction section begun. First we sent stoichiometric CO2:H2 (1:4) mixture at 230C for 1h and then we heated to 350C to monitor catalytic variations. The experiment was succesfull for both samples and the collected data for one of them, reported in the figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, can be summarized as following. Ni K-edge XANES clearly showed as Ni is present as NiO nanoparticle in the as prepared material. During H2 activation we observed as Ni is reduced to metallic Ni (active state for Sabatier reaction) without a clear variation of Ni particle size confirmed from EXAFS and FT-EXAFS spectra. It is worth to note as high quality EXAFS spectra (k &gt; 10 â„«) were succesfully collected in 10 minutes in fluoresce mode. At the same time DRIFT spectra clearly presented the presence of Ce 3+ band which can be used to qualitatevely monitor the presence of Ce 3+ . High quality XAFS and DRIFt spectra were collected under resction conditions as well however, their analysis is still in progress.</p><p>Finally, Mass Spectroscopy data indicated CH4 productivity in line with catalytic tests conducted in our laboratories. Overall the beamtime CH6666 : I) demonstrated as the DRIFt/XAFS set-up not only provides unvaluable complementary spectroscopic results but allows to approch closer to reaction conditions and II) it allowed to test and implement the fluorescence detector to the DRIFT set-up, allowing to widen the number measurable systems. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Ni K-edge left) XANES and center)k 2 -weighted EXAFS and (magnitude) FT-EXAFS spectra collected during H2-activation.
