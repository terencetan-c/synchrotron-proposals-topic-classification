<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report</head><p>Abstract: This proposal aims to study the local structure of Pt particles dispersed on CaTi1-xFexO3-d, with x=0, 0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4, 0.7 during CO oxidation. This novel support material shows catalytic activities similar to ceria, converting CO already at room temperature. We believe that this high performance is due to the presence of both, Ti and Fe in the support and interaction with Pt and the support, via oxygen vacancies created through Fe-doping and/or strong metalsupport interaction (creation of Pt-Fe bonds). Using operando photon-in/photon-out spectroscopy we will study the electronic structure and local coordination of Ti, Fe and Pt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of the experiment:</head><p>We opted for a mixed configuration of different crystal analysers in order to be able to probe the different edges present in the Pt-CTF catalyst (Fe, Ti K-edge and Pt L3-edge) during the in-situ and operando experiment. The sample was sieved and put in 1.5mm quartz capillaries. The inlet was connected to a mass flow controller system and the outlet to a mass spectrometer. The heating of the sample was performed using a gas blower.</p><p>In the first part of the experiment the Pt-CTFX samples (with x = 0.1, 0.4) where measured ex-situ as pellets at RT. Then we proceeded with the in-situ experimental protocol: activation of the catalyst under H2 at 350°C cooling down at RT (step1). Subsequent fast flush in He, and heating of the catalyst up to 250°C in CO oxidation gas feed conditions (nominally 1000ppm CO and 10 000 ppm O2). Each sample was then cooled down to a suitable temperature (about 160°C) sufficient to see both CO and CO2 signal in the mass spectrometer. At this temperature we measured the sample in CO+O2 (step 2), O2 (step 3), CO+O2 (step 4), CO (step 5), and again in CO+O2 (step 6), probing both the Pt nanoparticles and the Fe and Ti atoms in the CTF support material in reducing and oxidizing conditions. The durtaion of the protocol for each sample was about 21h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The ex-situ measurements spectra show that all sample the Pt nanoparticles are oxidized (very high white line intensity compared to Pt reference foil). All the Ti spectra are really close each other the main difference lays in the pre-edge region where the intensity of the t2g feature (4.968-4.971 keV) increases along with the increasing of the Fe doping while the eg (4.973-4.976 keV) is decreasing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> green box top figure). From the Fe K-edge XANES we observe the presence of just one pre-edge features at 7.14 -7.15 keV which we link to the sole presence of Fe(III) in the system. Moreover, we observe the presence of a small shoulder on the rising edge region which might be related to the presence of oxygen vacancies/mobility in the system as will be explained later. A direct comparison of the Fe-XANES spectra between different samples result difficult because of the presence of strong self-absorption (increase of the pre-edge intensity and decrease of the whithe line intenisty). Thus all the comparison between spectra has been done qualitatively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> green box bottom figure).</p><p>From the in-situ measurements the following preliminary results can be given: Under activation conditions (step 1) the white line of the Pt L3 XANES nanoparticles decrease, which is an indication of the reduction of the Pt nanoparticles( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> a,d blue lines). The Ti sites, as expected, are not reduced, indeed XANES and XES Ti K-edge spectra in this condition do not show any change from the ex-situ spectra. Conversely, the XAS and XES Fe K-edge a notable shift at lower energies in the XANES rising edge region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> b, e, blue lines) is appearing and a small shift in the crossover peak at 7.093 keV(Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 c</ref>, f, blue lines) in the valence to core (vtc) XES compared to the exsitu spectra. We attribute these changes as the evidence of O2 depletion from the CTF bulk to participate into the oxidation of CO. In presence of CO+O2 (oxidative condition, step 2, Fig 1 a,d orange line), the XANES of the Pt L3 shows a white line intensity between the one of the ex-situ (oxidized Pt) and reduced Pt (in H2). The Ti XANES and XES spectra do not change and won't be discussed any longer, since we were not able to detect any spectral differences. The XANES and XES Fe spectra show the same profiles of the ex-situ one. Probably during this step, the support bulk oxygen atoms are less needed (energetically disfavoured) for the reaction and/or on the other hand an equilibrium has been reached between O2 from the gas phase and bulk oxygen. In presence of sole O2 (step 3), the white line of the Pt XANES increases again but the XANES profile is different from the ex-situ one. We hypothesize the formation in this step of PtO2 species. The Fe K-edge spectra do not change from the previous step. Sending again CO+O2 (step 4) provoke similar spectral changes on the Pt L3 spectra. The main difference here is an increase of the white line intensity respect to the spectrum in step 1 (Fig1, a,d red vs orange lines) that can be reasonably attributed to a larger presence of PtO2 sites created once O2 was sent. Again here, both XANES and XES Fe K-edge spectra do not change. Switching to sole CO (reducing conditions, step 5) we see again a strong decrease of the white line in the Pt XANES, while the Fe XANES and XES spectra show the same changes in the rising edge and crossover peak region as in the case of H2 reduction. In this condition it is easier to assert that these changes really due to oxygen depletion inside the bulk of CTF support since no oxygen is provided to oxidise CO. Finally, sending for the third time CO+O2 (step 6) causes an increase of the intensity of the Pt XANES white line, which however is lower in intensity if compared to CO+O2 condition in step 2 (Fig1, a,d brown vsorange lines). Since CO is a strongly reducing agent we attribute this change to the presence of strongly bounded CO molecule absorbed on Pt atoms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>• The increase of Fe concentration in the support material do not seem to affect the reaction mechanism in the X range 0.1 to 0.4. • The Ti atoms do not seems participate during the reaction conditions since we do not detect any spectral change compared to the ex-situ spectra. • XANES and XES seems to suitable tools to distingush the speciation of the Pt nanoparticles and detect the oxygen mobility. However, further investigation has to be made to properly assert this point. (XANES and XES ab-initio calculations will be crucial).</p><p>t 2g e g a b c d e f ex-situ spectra in-situ operando spectra</p><p>• Is clear that the Fe doping allow oxygen mobility but unfortunately its role is still not fully understood since no clear chemical oxidation or reduction has been observed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Green box: ex-situ spectra of PtCTFX catalyst measured as pellets (top Ti K-edge XANES, bottom Fe-K-edge).
