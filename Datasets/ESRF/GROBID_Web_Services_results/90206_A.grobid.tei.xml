<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This report will summarise a study carried out on the use of novel perovskite-type materials in an in-situ fixed bed chemical looping reactor carrying out the water-gas shift reaction or methane oxidation for hydrogen production. In comparison with mixed reactor systems, the use of temporally separate countercurrent feed streams allows for the production of unmixed product streams thereby eliminating the need for additional separation stages, and allowing for the chemical reaction equilibria constraints associated with mixed reactions to be overcome. Carbon monoxide was used as the reducing agent for La0.6Sr0.4FeO3-δ (LSF641) and Mn-doped LSF (LSFM6473), while methane was used as the reducing agent for a La0.8CexNiyTizO3 (LaCeNiTi) family member. In order to quantify the temperature changes occurring during the chemical reactions in situ, Y2O3 or ZrO2 was added to the material beds in a ratio of 1:5 by mass.</p><p>The same furnace and flow system that was successfully used in experiment MA-3410 was also used in this study. In order to maximise the use of available beam time, the installation of the equipment was carried out during a machine day. The beamline was calibrated for 35 keV operation with a spot size of approximately 1 mm x 1 mm. The first shift was slated for safety inspection and bed alignment checks and these were completed on time. For cycling experiments, data collection protocols were established to allow for diffraction patterns to be collected in as little as 13.2 seconds. Downtime during set-up was used to carry out scans of capillaries containing materials of interest, and the reactor furnace was set to heat up.</p><p>During the next shift scans were taken at a central point of a bed of LSF641 being fed various oxygen buffer gases at 1013 K, 1053 K, 1093 K and 1133 K. These allowed for the lattice parameter of the material to be determined at higher oxygen partial pressures than before. Afterwards the furnace temperature set-point was set to 1093 K for the next experiment.</p><p>The next shifts were allocated to carrying out a series of experiments with a bed of LSFM6473. Some of these involved flowing CO/CO2 buffer gases to the reactor, where two points at either end of the bed were scanned until reaching steady state, after which two scans at 15 different positions were taken going up and down the bed. This allowed for the lattice cell parameters to be determined as a function of position, and was useful in determining how the material properties of the bed were changing as it went from an oxidised state to a more reduced state and vice versa compared with the outlet gas analysis.</p><p>Further experiments involved counter-currently feeding 5% CO and 5% H2O streams to the bed for 60 cycles to carry out the chemical looping water-gas shift process. For the first 15 cycles, measurements were taken at a point near the bottom of the bed, while in the subsequent 15 cycles measurements were taken at a point towards the top of the bed. For the final 30 cycles, measurements were taken at 15 points on the bed each over 2 non-consecutive cycles. The changes in the lattice cell parameter at each position in the bed over the course of a cycle can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>, which also demonstrates the high resolution that can be achieved using the ID22 beamline. The same bed was also cycled between the most oxidising and most reducing CO/CO2 buffer gases (ratios 1:20 and 20:1 in argon) to see how the material changed when using CO2 as the oxidising agent as well as to give controlled inlet conditions for comparison to bed simulations. It was found that there was an approximately 70 K difference between the temperature determined from the yttrium oxide measurements and the set-point temperature of the furnace (1093 K) as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1b</ref>.</p><p>During the next shifts, the furnace was set to cool down so that two LaCeNiTi beds could be loaded. A temperature programmed oxidation experiment was then carried out to fully oxidise the bed and determine its oxygen capacity. This was followed by a methane temperature programmed reduction (MTPR) experiment up to 1023 K to determine the structural changes in the material that correlate to the methane oxidation (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>). XRD scans revealed that the conversion in methane coincided with a phase transformation of NiO to Ni metal and, at the same time, with a slight shift and broadening of the perovskite peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). Following the MTPR experiments, a number of cycles were then carried out feeding 5% CH4 and 5% O2 from the top of the bed. Further cycling experiments on a larger LaCeNiTi bed were carried out aiming to determine the effect of feed length durations on the structure of the material. As before, a temperature programmed oxidation experiment was carried out prior to cycling to fully oxidise the bed. Finally another experiment was carried out cycling between 5% CH4 and 5% H2O to determine the structural changes occurring during water to hydrogen conversion within the material. The remainder of the time was spent scanning a total of 50 capillaries containing different LaCeNiTi samples.</p><p>Experiments were successful allowing us to extract valuable information about changes in the material's properties in-situ. The data acquired provided valuable insight on the phase, lattice parameter and nanostructure changes of the studied materials under redox cycling. Results obtained are complemented by outlet gas analysis that can be used to directly correlate the material's activity to the changes in its structure. Overall, the experiments carried out will allow for a deeper understanding of the materials and the process that will lead to the optimisation of both. b) a) b) a)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Ian Metcalfe a* , John Evans b* , Wenting Hu a* a Newcastle University, School of Engineering, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom b University of Durham, Department of Chemistry Science Laboratories, Durham, United Kingdom</figDesc></figure>
