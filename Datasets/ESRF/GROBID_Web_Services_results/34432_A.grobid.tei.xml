<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dr Chris HALL *Dr Sarah RIGBY *Dr Majid FAHRAMAND *Ms Suzanne CRITTELL *Dr Steven WILKINSON *Dr Kan-Cheung CHEUNG *Mr Mark IBISON CLRC Daresbury Laboratory University of Liverpool University of Liverpool University of Liverpool Cranfield University CLRC Daresbury Laboratory University of Liverpool Report:</p><p>Objectives.</p><p>To demonstrate Diffraction-Enhanced Imaging (DEI) of joint cartilage in CT mode, for comparison with MRI results using the same samples.</p><p>To performance test specially-designed phantoms for DEI.</p><p>To investigate usefulness of information obtainable from cartilage samples, using the Multiple-Image Radiography (MIR) technique. An early decision was made to operate with the monochromator set at 40keV using the Si 1,1,1 reflection (giving a reasonable compromise between optics stability/rocking-curve width, contrast, and penetration) and an X-ray camera resolution of 30 m (giving acceptable image quality vs. field of view). The upstream Laue monochomator was tuned to this energy, being retuned at every beam refill, when the beam profile was also checked to select the optimum flat intensity region. Automated scripts were run to coordinate image acquisition with motor movements, as well as dark and flat (white) fields. Integration times were adjusted to improve statistics for images away from peak intensity, while avoiding detector 'saturation' in the white fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Notes on</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Beamline Configuration (ID 17).</head><p>Images were taken at 7 or more positions on the Analyser rocking-curve:-Peak, +80%, +50%, +30%; and where possible, +15%.</p><p>Image sets were collected for all 3 phantoms and 3 tissue samples to support the MIR technique. This uses an algorithm to extract not only a 'refraction' image (as in DEI) but also an 'ultra-small-angle scatter' image from the data set. In addition, a full CT scan set was obtained, for one of the samples; time did not permit CT of all samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of Results.</head><p>Some initial test processing of image data was carried out at ESRF to check for useability; however, all images were subsequently fully analysed at Liverpool, where special 'MIR' algorithms have been developed. Problems were encountered in registering flat field with image data files for correction/normalisation, due mainly to the lack of general availability of the specialised ESRF software; however, these were overcome to produce useful results.</p><p>Refraction Phantom, DEI Refraction Image Whole Joint Sample, DEI Refraction Image using +50% points on Rocking-Curve Refraction Phantom, in Imaging orientation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions.</head><p>It has been shown that acceptable DEI imaging can be performed successfully on the ESRF in 16-bunch operating mode.</p><p>Data when fully analysed is expected to be incorporated into the PhD thesis for student Ms S Crittell (Liverpool).</p><p>It will also be valuable to compare results with similar images from the newly-commissioned DEI imaging station (9.4) at the SRS, Daresbury Laboratory, UK, which will be used to continue the cartilage study of which Experiment MD-248 forms a part.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Study of Articular Cartilage using Diffraction-EnhancedImaging on whole joints, in CT mode and Multiple Image Radiography</figDesc></figure>
