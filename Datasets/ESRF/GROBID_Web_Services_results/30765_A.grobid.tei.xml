<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental:</head><p>The mechanism of primary nucleation in polymer crystallization is still a highly debated area <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref> , with continuing investigations experimentally and theoretically being performed. Here, we report on several experiments which investigate the isothermal and shear-induced crystallization kinetics of novel polyethylene systems 1 . The polymers to be studied have been specially synthesized in the Sheffield University Chemistry Department and are collectively described as model hydrogenated polybutadienes 4 , having novel molecular architectures. The model polymers are monodisperse systems given in the table below, which have been blended with similar monodisperse 'comb' systems which have varying degrees of long chain branching (LCB). These blends have been mixed at levels of 5% and 10%, equal to and above the C* entanglement weight of the comb additive system.</p></div>

The crystallization was then followed by using SAXS. The crystallization kinetics were compared to those which occur at similar temperatures under quiescent conditions. Results: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, shows the crystallization rates in the graph (B) from integrating the SAXS data in (A) with repect to time and comparing with quiescent crystallization at simialr temperatures for the pure comb10 sample. Here, it is clear that the crystallization kinetics are massively increased by the shear pulse compared with quiescent conditions and there is clear evidence that there is orientation in the SAXS patterns. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the SAXS data and simialr crystallization curves are given for Blend C. Again the pulse of shear increases the crystallization time dramatically and some orientation is seen. The orientation in the SAXS patterns is an indication of the ordered stacking of lamellae in perprndicular to the direction of the shear. Some of the SAXS indicated that orientation was not present (Blends A, E &amp; F) even after shear, however the crsytallization kinetics were still greatly increased compatred to the same quiescent conditions. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, the crystallization times at t Â½ (crystallization half-time) are plotted with respect to temperature for the complete set of blends under sheared and quiescent experimental conditions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="55">secs 500 secs 1020 secs</head><p>Conclusions:</p><p>From the crystallization data obtained it is clear that the addition of just a few % long chain branched material into a linear matrix will increase the crystallization rate significantly under sheared conditions compared to that of quiescent crystallization. Also, orientation of the lamellae formed during crystallization does occur in some of the samples, however even if orientation is not seen in the SAXS the kinetics are still increased. The doubling of the comb additive causes a doubling in crystallization kinetics as shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The long chain branched additive is seen to act as nucleation sites during shear, increasing the kinetics and possible orienting of the lamellae. This is due to the long relaxation times compared to the simialr linear matrix molecules of the comb material once it has been stretched during the shear motion.</p><p>1) E.L. Heeley, A.C.
