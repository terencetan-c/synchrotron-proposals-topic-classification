<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Part 1 (O. Betz, D. Weide): Head morphology of staphylinid beetles. Generally, staphylinid beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) are known as predators. However, in several groups, the feeding mechanism has changed, and especially some members of the subfamily Aleocharinae are known as feeders of fungal spores. Our studies focus on the changes in the head anatomy, which have occurred in correlation with this novel feeding strategy. During the experiments we obtained 43 µCTs of the following representatives of Staphylinidae:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The structure of the tentorium is similar within the different species. Its main components are the corpotentorium with anterior, dorsal, and posterior arms. The tentorium can be compact like in O. rivulare, whereas it is more delicate in other species (e.g., A. laticollis and G. fasciata). Moreover, in some inner skeletons (e.g. tentorium of Tachyporus nitidulus) there is no compact corpotentorium or some components like the dorsal arm can be reduced. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows the results for one species using the 3D segmentation tool of the software amira ® for rendering the 3D structure of the inner head skeleton. Beside the tentorium, other sclerites ensure the stability of the head capsule and serve as attachment structure for a number of head muscles. Additionally, based on their position one can assume that the sclerites, which are located on the dorsal wall of the hypopharynx (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, blue), give stability to the hypopharynx. On the right side, there is displayed the consensus shape (i.e., both PC1 and PC2 scores are set to zero) with explanations of the parts of the head as represented by the selected landmarks. The transformation grids are drawn in regions, where the shape differences are most obvious.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a c</head><p>In order to quantify the anatomical differences between the different species, we apply the techniques of 3D geometric morphometrics to our µCT data. Twenty-six easily identifiable homologous landmarks were used, most of them describing the insertion points of head muscles, which move the different head appendages such as the mouthparts and the antennae. The landmarks were set within selected 2D images of the Synchrotron µCT voxel datasets with the coordinate measurement tool of VGStudio Max. The 3D coordinates of each landmark were stored within an Excel datasheet, which could be directly read into Morphologika (O`Higgins &amp; Jones 2004), in which all the following analyses were performed. For illustration purposes, a first example of these analyses as performed in four species is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-c</ref>. Our ESRF data will make it possible to extend these analyses to all of the more than 20 investigated species in order to find quantitative correlations between their morphology, their systematic position, and their feeding type.</p><p>In addition to the regular experiments we did a short study with samples that were fixated with osmium tetroxide. This aimed at analysing whether osmium "staining" enhances contrast of soft tissue. For this propose we used individuals, which were scanned at an energy close to the absorption maximum of osmium (20 KeV). Our results indicate that the fixation with osmium tetroxide is indeed useful to enhance the contrast of soft tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). prothorax obtained by Synchrotron µCT to show the effect of osmium "staining". The beam energy was set to 20 keV. The beetle was cut posterior to its prothorax, so that osmium tetroxide had easy access to the muscles, the gut, and the ventral nerve chord, which are located in the prothorax. As a result, this tissue appears brighter in the beam than the leg muscles, which were entirely enclosed within the cuticular leg-capsule and thus less accessible to the osmation. Abbreviations: g gut, lm muscles of the leg, pthm muscles of the prothorax, vnc ventral nerve chord. Bar = 300 µm.</p><p>Part 2 (M. Heethoff, O. Betz): Some preliminary µCT studies were conducted with whole microarthropods. We used specimens of the parthenogenetic oribatid mite Archegozetes longisetosus Aoki (Acari, Oribatida).</p><p>It was aimed to test fixation methods of intact animals having a strongly sclerotized cuticle for subsequent phase enhanced µCT analyses. Data were obtained with a spatial resolution of 0.7 µm and analyzed with the volume graphics software VGStudio Max (Volume Graphics). Cuticular structures, muscles and tissues of the digestive system were obtainable in detail (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), less dense tissues such as the synganglion and the ovary had a large signal-overlap with the surrounding air. These were obtained on the virtual sections but got lost in 3D renditions. Based on these results, a new proposal for beamtime on ID19 was submitted and approved (Heethoff, Betz). Methods enhancing the detection of soft tissues such as holotomography will be tested as well as the analysis of unfixed fresh material (eggs). Literature: O`Higgins, P. &amp; Jones, N. (2004).
