<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High-pressure versus isoelectronic doping effect on the honeycomb iridate Na2IrO3</head><p>We study the effect of isoelectronic doping and external pressure in tuning the ground state of the honeycomb iridate Na2IrO3 by combining optical spectroscopy with synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements on single crystals. The obtained optical conductivity of Na2IrO3 is discussed in terms of a Mott-insulating picture versus the formation of quasimolecular orbitals and in terms of Kitaev interactions. With increasing Li content x, (Na1-xLix)2IrO3 moves deeper into the Mott-insulating regime, and there are indications that up to a doping level of 24% the compound comes closer to the Kitaev limit. The optical conductivity spectrum of singlecrystalline α-Li2IrO3 does not follow the trends observed for the series up to x=0.24. There are strong indications that α-Li2IrO3 is not as close to the Kitaev limit as Na2IrO3 and lies closer to the quasimolecular orbital picture instead. Except for the pressure-induced hardening of the phonon modes, the optical properties of Na2IrO3 seem to be robust against external pressure. Possible explanations of the unexpected evolution of the optical conductivity with isolectronic doping and the drastic change between x=0.24 and x=1 are given by comparing the pressure-induced changes of lattice parameters and the optical conductivity with the corresponding changes induced by doping.</p><p>[Results published in Phys.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Competition between spin-orbit coupling, magnetism, and dimerization in the honeycomb iridates: α-Li2IrO3 under pressure Single-crystal x-ray diffraction studies with synchrotron radiation on the honeycomb iridate α-Li2IrO3 reveal a pressure-induced structural phase transition with symmetry lowering from monoclinic to triclinic at a critical pressure of Pc=3.8 GPa. According to the evolution of the lattice parameters with pressure, the transition mainly affects the ab plane and thereby the Ir hexagon network, leading to the formation of Ir-Ir dimers. These observations are independently predicted and corroborated by our ab initio density functional theory calculations where we find that the appearance of Ir-Ir dimers at finite pressure is a consequence of a subtle interplay between magnetism, correlation, spin-orbit coupling, and covalent bonding. Our results further suggest that at Pc the system undergoes a magnetic collapse. Finally we provide a general picture of competing interactions for the honeycomb lattices A2MO3 with A=Li, Na and M=Ir, Ru.</p><p>[Results published in Phys. Rev. B 97, 020104(R) (2018)]</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pressure-induced formation of Rh zigzag chains in the honeycomb rhodate Li2RhO3</head><p>Powder x-ray diffraction studies with synchrotron radiation on the honeycomb rhodate Li2RhO3 reveal a pressure-induced structural phase transition within the monoclinic symmetry group C2/m at a critical pressure of 6.5 GPa. The evolution of the lattice parameters with pressure indicates, that the transition mainly affects the ab plane and thereby the Rh hexagon network comparable to the transition in α-Li2IrO3. In contrast to the iridate compound, the hardening is mainly found along the a direction leading to the pressure-induced formation of Rh zigzag chains in Li2RhO3 at a critical pressure of 6.5 GPa.</p></div>

X1 and Y1 mainly have components along a, whereby Z1 has only components along b. Above 6.5 GPa X1 and Y1 reduces dramatically, while Z1 enhances by the same amount. This leads to the formation of a zigzag chain in the a direction, which is illustrated by the thick red bonds in the graphic.</p></div>		</body>
