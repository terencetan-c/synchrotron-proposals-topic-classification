<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Following acceptance of our application, we shipped the first sample consisting of reconstituted E. faecium trans-translating complex for acquisition on a Titan Krios at the ESRF. Eight grids (four 4x2 and four 2x1 cflat grids) were shipped to ESRF and some minor problems occurred during the clipping of the grids (upon removing the lid, the grids stuck to the plastic and only the grid in position 3 remained safely in the box). The four 4x2 c-flat grids were used for the acquisition while the four 2x1 grids were kept at the ESRF.</p><p>Image data collection parameters: Camera type: Gatan K3; Acquisition mode: counting; Compression: TIFF LZW; Gain normalized: yes; Magnification 81k; Pixel size 1.06 Ang/pixel; Electron dose 19.4 electrons/pixel/s; Exposure time 2s; Total dose per movie 34.5 electron/Ang2; Number of frames per movie 40; Defocus spread -0.6 to -2.4 um in 0.2 um step.; Energy filter: Gatan Quantum LS; Slit width: 20 eV: Phase plate: no</p><p>During the allocated six shifts, we acquired up to 17480 movies <ref type="bibr">(27-28-29 September 2023)</ref>. While the ice/grid quality was far from perfect, trans-translating ribosome were observed in the "on-the-fly" 2D classification. We downloaded the data and completed our analysis (see box 1). Our results are very promising but as shown Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> however the tmRNA-SmpB complex is somehow under resolved. This is partly due to the intrinsic flexibility of the tmRNA pseudoknot ring but, for the TLD-SmpB (which is deeply inserted into the ribosome A-site and therefore much more stable), it is mostly due to the small number of particles (43,870) retained for the final reconstruction.</p><p>Indeed while starting from 17,480 movies we had to remove two third of the movies (empty ice) and only 5,762 movies (corresponding to the thicker ice where ribosome were present) were kept for further analysis. This leaved us with 155,177 initial particles, which were further separated in: 27,498 blurry particles, 83,809 stalled ribosomes and 43,870 trans-translating ribosomes with a visible pseudoknot ring. While our final global resolution is around 3 Å the local resolution of the tmRNA-SmpB complex range between 5 -8 Å which is too low to be able to analyses the contact within the three partner at the atomic or even at the residue level.</p><p>Concerned by the quality of our grids we also tested another sample frozen at the same time and using the same condition using 2x1 c-flat grids and the ice quality was indeed much better, which let us hope for the best with the 4 remaining grids.</p><p>Taken all together, we strongly believe that we need more images to improve the local resolution of the tmRNA-smpB complex and to understand how they interact with each other and with the ribosome. Considering that another set of 4 grids are already clipped and stored at the ESRF, that there was no transportation/clipping issue with those grids and that the ice quality should be better, we would like to request one more session of acquisition on a Titan Krios with the same acquisition parameter as for the previous session (27-29 th September 2023). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Box 1 :Fig. 1</head><label>11</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Initial electron density maps of E faecium in trans-translation state (A) 70s Ribosome with tmRNA and smpB (average resolution of 3 Å); (B) Local resolution for the tmRNA-smpB part only (average resolution of 5 -8 Å)</figDesc></figure>
