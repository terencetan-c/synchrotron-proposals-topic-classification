<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It was unclear upon initial discovery whether the hominin fossils should be attributed to Australopithecus africanus, Homo (habilis), or whether the material belonged to a new taxon. The primary aim of the experiment was to assess bone histomorphometric variables of long bone diaphyses in the individual represented by the partial skull (MH 1). The secondary aim was to digitally extract postrcranial elements from remaining surrounding matrix, restore fragmentary specimens, and aid in further study of its postcranial (e.g., locomotor) adaptations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Current status of the project</head><p>In February 2010, we successfully scanned long bone material that was attributed to the juvenile male (MH 1). Subsquently, additional material has been recovered and attributed to this individual, while some material previously attributed to this individual (e.g., the distal half of a well-preserved tibia) is no longer attributed to MH 1. Results of the imaging conducted at the ESRF led to much better visualization of external and internal anatomy than results obtained from previous acquisitions using medical computed tomography.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Reconstruction of locomotor behavior</head><p>The relatively intact tibia that was originally assigned to MH 1 has been reassigned to a different (adult) individual subsequent to acqusition of the synchrotron image data. Nonetheless, attempts to quantify/visualize its internal bone microstructure, as proposed, were largely unsuccessful. While a few areas of its diaphysis retained some intact histomorphometric structure, most of the internal structure of this particularly promising specimen, as well as others from the site of Malapa that have been investigated thus far, showed disorganized osteonal structure. It appears that subsequent to deposition organisms (likely bacterial in nature) disrupted osteonal organization through taphonomic processes while accessing the organic components of long bone shafts. However, a metacarpal shaft from a non-adult individual was found to preserve pristine osteonal organization. It is presently unclear whether this specimen should be attributed to MH 1, or to another nonadult individual. These results have contributed to a better understanding of the taphonomic history of the Malapa fossil assemblage.</p><p>In a second research thrust aimed at reconstructing locomotor behaviour of A. sediba, crosssectional geometric properties of MH 1 humeral and femoral shafts have been calculated using synchrotron image data <ref type="bibr">(Carlson et al. in prep)</ref>. The images acquired using synchrotron technology were of much greater quality than previous ones obtained using medical computed tomography, which was necessary to accurately visualize and quantify internal cortical boundaries in MH 1 femoral specimens. Initial indications are that the forelimb to hind limb strength ratios of MH 1 were more similar to later Homo (e.g., H. erectus) than even H. habilis (see <ref type="bibr">Carlson et al., 2010)</ref> The forelimb to hindlimb strength ratio of MH 1 also appears more similar to that estimated for Lucy (A. afarensis) and those of modern humans compared to those of chimpanzees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Post-cranial developmental patterns in A. sediba</head><p>Synchrotron-based imaging of the postcranial remains of MH 1 has contributed to a better understanding of patterns of growth in A. sediba (e.g., epiphyseal fusion sequences). The acquired synchrotron image data have proven useful when assessing relevant metaphyseal surfaces of fossil long bones. The analysis of MH 1 epiphyseal closure patterns is still ongoing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Comparison of dental and postcranial development</head><p>This analysis, or set of comparisons, has been delayed by the ongoing analyses of separate dental and postcranial development. Once these are published, the degree of concordance between the two sets of indicators can be investigated further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Future work plan</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Additional functional investigations of long bone structure</head><p>Thus far, a metacarpal shaft from a non-adult individual has been shown to retain osteonal organization. This specimen is presently being studied, and results will be published once necessary comparative data have been acquired. Through the investigation of the specimen, we may be able to address loading patterns on the palmar and dorsal sides of the hand of the individual, perhaps giving some indication as to how the upper limb functioned during grasping behaviours (e.g., how frequent was below branch position behaviour).</p></div>

At the time, material from the site was still being analyzed and studied. It was clearly Plio-Pleistocene based on associated fauna, but little else was known of its geochronological age.</figDesc></figure>
