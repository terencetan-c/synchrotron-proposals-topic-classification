<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Tellurium belongs to a group of elements that have recently been discovered to adopt an incommensurately modulated crystal structure at high pressure. In the pressure range of 8-29 GPa, Te adopts a body-centred monoclinic structure with an incommensurate transverse modulation, where the modulation vector is parallel to the crystal b-axis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The same structure type was also observed in the chalcogens Se and S. Recent calculations have suggested that these incommensurate phases may arise through Fermisurface nesting via a Kohn anomaly or charge density wave <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. No experimental data has been published on the phonon dispersion relations in any of the incommensurate group-VI elements to test these calculations.</p><p>A single-crystal of the high-pressure phase Te-III was prepared by loading a small single-crystalline piece of Te in its ambient-pressure trigonal form into a diamond-anvil high-pressure cell and pressurising it slowly to 8.5 GPa. A 4:1 methanol/ethanol mixture was used as the pressure-transmitting medium. It is well known that single crystals tend to shatter into polycrystals when taken across a pressure-induced structural phase transition, and Te is no exception in this respect. A small Te-III crystal with lateral dimensions of 30 x 40 µm 2 and an estimated thickness of 10-20 µm was prepared previously in our group for diffraction experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We attempted to obtain somewhat larger crystals of Te-III for the IXS experiment: Close to 100 crystals of Te were screened at ambient pressure and about 40 of them, which were high-quality     single crystals, pressurised to ~9 GPa. Unfortunately, the crystal quality degraded at the phase transitions to such an extent that we decided to use the initial Te-III crystal despite its small dimensions. The inelastic x-ray scattering experiment was performed on beamline ID28 using the Si (999) configuration, i.e., with a photon energy of 18 keV and an energy resolution of 3 meV. A first set of spectra of longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons was collected for momentum transfers along the (0 k 0) line in reciprocal space, i.e, parallel to the modulation vector. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows a selected spectrum together with the fitted model (the Fit28 software was used for the data analysis). Typical accumulation times were 90 s per data point. From these spectra, the LA phonon dispersion curve over a full Brillouin zone was constructed as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. An anomaly is observed near the modulation vector q = (0 0.71 0). In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the dashed line indicates a simple sine-type relation for comparison, and the dashed-dotted line shows the differences between the energies given by the dashed line and the observed phonon energies.</p><p>We have attempted to measure also the dispersion of the transverse acoustic (TA) branches. This was made difficult, however, by the fact that the Te-III crystal was twinned (which is hardly avoidable). Due to the particular nature of this twinning it does not affect measurements along (0 k 0), but it causes a superposition of two sets of dispersion branches for q = (0 k 1) and q = (0 k -2), where we tried to detect the TA branches. Further analysis of the data may allow us to extract at least parts of the TA branches.</p><p>We complemented the experimental study by first-principles phonon calculations based on a body-centred monoclinic unit cell without incommensurate modulation. Using linear-response theory as implemented in the abinit code [2], the three acoustic phonon branches were calculated along the (0 k 0) as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. The experimental and computational results for the LA are in excellent agreement. The theoretical results for the lower-energy TA branch evidence a lattice dynamical instability at the experimentally observed modulation vector. The anomaly observed in the experimental results of the LA branch can thus be considered a weaker image of this instability. The combined experimental and theoretical results demonstrate for the first time that the incommensurately modulated structure in Te-III is the consequence of a lattice dynamical instability. Preliminary calculations of the Fermi surface of Te-III suggest Fermi-surface nesting as a likely origin of the dynamical instability as suggested also in recent theoretical work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These findings are also important to understand the behaviour of Se and S.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: The incommensurately modulated crystal structure of Te-III at 8 GPa as viewed down the a-axis.
