<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Overview:</p><p>The effect of particle size on the reactivity of cobalt nanoparticles in Fischer-Tropsch chemistry is well established, but less is known about the impact on cobalt-based CO2 hydrogenation. To study this, we used Surface Organometallic Chemistry (SOMC) to synthesize well-defined cobalt nanoparticles (Co-NPs) on SiO 2 , varying particle size by adjusting treatment temperature: Using Co(Alkyl) 2 tmeda as molecular precursor, yielded highly dispersed Co-NPs on SiO 2 . Characterization of the SOMC-derived materials was carried out using microscopy and spectroscopy to assess surface cleanliness and particle formation. The catalytic behavior of the materials was studied in CO 2 hydrogenation and found to change with particle size. The objective of the experiment at BM31 was to obtain in situ XAS data under CO 2 hydrogenation conditions, which would allow us to link the fundamental shift in reactivity to the state of catalyst under working conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data obtained and experimental parameters:</head><p>X-ray absorption spectra data was collected on powdered samples of Co@SiO2 that were reductively treated with hydrogen flow at different temperatures to vary particle size. The samples were supported on Degussa AEROSIL-200 and data was collected using a quartz capillary with an outer diameter of 1.0 mm and inner diameter of 0.9mm, which were mounted on stainless steel-frames equipped with swagelok 3-way valves allowing to bypass the sample prior to the experiment. Beam energies ranged from 7.65 to 8.6 keV to capture the Co K edge. The flow rates of He and H 2 were controlled using mass-flow controllers and pressure was maintained using a back-pressure regulator. The temperature was maintained for for all stages of the experiment using a nitrogen gas blower and was calibrated prior to measurements using a K-type thermocouple inside the sample cell. The outlet gas composition was monitored using a mass spectrometer mounted after the back-pressure regulator.</p><p>A typical experiment for in situ CO 2 hydrogenation was performed as follows: This procedure allowed us to follow the catalyst changes under reaction conditions while having maximum control over the system (complete air/ moisture-free environtment from synthesis at home institution until end of experiment), revealing a sharp change in catalyst state as the cobalt nanoparticles become smaller than 2 nm. (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further work and anticipated output:</head><p>Currently, the data is being further processed, especially in regards to the EXAFS data analytical part, to obtain a deeper understanding of what is happening under reaction conditions. The obtained XANES data are already intriguing and are among the missing pieces of this particle-size project. A manuscript including the in situ XAS data is being drafted and planned to be submitted later this year.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Van Beek, Dr. Dragos Stoian Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Xiaoyu Zhou*, Scott Docherty*, Christian Ehinger*, Kazutaka Sakamoto*.
