<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystals (PDLCs) are composite materials consisting of droplets of low molar mass liquid crystals (LCs), randomly dispersed in a polymeric matrix. Liquid crystal droplet sizes are typically in the range 0.1 µm -10 µm, where droplets of 1 -5 µm are the most common. PDLCs exhibit unique linear and non-linear optical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> which are expected to boost the LC technology in the near future (new displays and light shutters, storage devices and nonlinear optical elements). Beyond the scope of applications, the interest in PDLCs has considerably stimulated fundamental research, concerning the phase separation and polymerization process, the optical properties, and especially the effects which are due to the confinement of LCs to small cavities <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In this case, a variety of unusual effects are introduced due to the large surface-to volume ratio, the most observable being changes in the nature of the phase transitions and the specific director configuration inside the cavity. When the droplet sizes are of the order of a few microns, the critical interplay between the ordering interactions at the boundary surface and the strong elastic deformation energies inside the volume results in a rich variety of director configurations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. External fields and temperature changes can be used to induce transitions from one configuration to another, and these transitions can be used to obtain a measure of the surface anchoring strength. The aim of the proposed experiment was to understandand the details of the nematic director configuration within single droplets of PDLCs by X-ray diffraction using a micro-focused X-ray beam (µ-XRD). The primary experimental tools used so far to determine the director field configuration within LC droplets have been optical polarizing microscopy and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The former is limited to droplet sizes greater than a few microns whereas for NMR investigations, specially deuterated nematic probe molecules must be used and, for the calculation of lineshapes, it is necessary to postulate a nematic configuration for all cavities within the sample and then average the local director orientation both within each cavity as well as over all cavities. µ-XRD in principle provides a unique tool to study the dependence of LC ordering on the droplet shape and size as well as on the nature of the polymer matrix. The aim of the present paper was to demonstrate the effectiveness of X-ray microdiffraction (µ-XRD) as a new experimental tool to probe LC ordering and director-field configuration within single droplets of PDLCs. To this purpose a micro-focused X-ray beam was used in transmission geometry and diffraction patterns from single droplets of an ultrathin-layer PDLC sample were collected and analysed. As very distinctive patterns can be observed corresponding to different configurations, this technique provides a unique tool to investigate the dependence of both LC ordering and director configuration on the droplet shape and size. The samples were prepared via thermally-initiated Polymerization Induced Phase Separation (PIPS) starting from a mixture of the epoxy resins EPON815 (by Shell, 25.4 % in weight) and MK107 (by Wilmington, 7.1 %) with the hardener Capcure 3-800 (by Miller Stephenson, 32.5 %) and the nematic LC E7 (by Merck, 35%; T KN =263 K, T NI =334 K). This mixture is known to form LC droplets with the bipolar configuration. A similar mixture with the smectogenic LC 8CB (T KA =295 K, T AN =307 K, T NI =314 K) replacing E7 was also prepared ro get samples with smectic LC droplets. Ultra-thin films of the PDLC samples were sliced out by means of a liquid nitrogen-refrigerated microtome. The thickness of the film (≈5 µm) was chosen to be comparable with the droplet size in order to reduce the probability for the probing X-ray beam to cross more than one droplet. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of a section of the investigated sample revealed a narrow distribution of spherical droplet sizes with an average droplet diameter of 2.0±0.1 µm for PDLC samples with E7. Slightly larger values were found for samples with 8CB. The diffraction experiments were carried out using the SAXS/WAXS scanning microdiffraction setup of ID13 microfocus beamline. A monochromatic beam (λ=0.784 Å or λ=1.109 Å) of 2 µm diameter (2 µrad divergence) produced by a tapered glass capillary X-ray optics was used. The PDLC-film sample (S) was supported by an electron-microscopy copper grid which was mounted on a high-resolution (&lt;1 µm) translation stage. A CCD microscope was used to select areas of interest on the sample. The data were collected at room temperature (T=297 K) for samples with E7 and at different temperatures between room temperature and 340 K for the samples containing the 8CB LC. Two-dimensional (2D) diffraction patterns were recorded using a 130mm MarCCD detector (D; pixel size 64.45 µm). The S-D distance was 109.08 mm The resolution in the scattering angle was ∆(2θ)=3•10 -2 deg. The selected region was mapped in steps of 2 µm in both horizontal and vertical directions. Different areas of the sample were investigated. As the polymer matrix is amorphous and isotropic (at least on the micrometer length scale) whereas bipolar droplets possess LC ordering and anisotropic director configuration, we could discriminate between the scattering from a droplet and that from the polymer binder in all cases except when the droplet axis was parallel to the incident beam. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> reports a representative example of the µ-XRD pattern of a single nematic (E7) LC droplet. This pattern was obtained from the measured one after subtracting the contribution of the isotropic background due to the polymeric matrix surrounding the selected droplet (inset of fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The diameter of this droplet was estimated to be less than 2 µm because no LC contribution to the scattered intensity was observed in the nearest neighbours sampling points. The anisotropy of the pattern is associated with a director-field configuration possessing cylindrical symmetry and is similar to the typical diffraction patterns observed for axially-oriented nematics. Other examples of µ-XRD patterns of single spherical droplets are reported in fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> where different orientations of the droplet axis are shown. The weak scattering signal in (C) is due to a submicrometer droplet; measurements of relative intensity allowed us to estimated a radius R≤0.3 µm. The pattern of fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(D</ref>) was taken after submitting the sample to a thermal cycle through the clearing point in order to eliminate possible effects of the slicing process on the LC orientation. The dominant feature of the scattering (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) for q || N ( ) is the pair of small-angle diffuse peaks centered at q=0.218</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Å λ θ π / sin 4 = q Å -1</formula><p>arising from longitudinal correlations in the molecular arrangement and corresponding to a spacing . The two wide-angle diffuse crescents centered on the equatorial line (q N) at q @ 1.4 Å Å 28.8 / 2 = = q d π ⊥ -1 are associated to the short-range liquid-like positional order of the molecules and correspond to an average molecular distance d@4.5 . However, differently from what observed for perfect axially-aligned samples, distinct arc-shaped profiles of both meridional and equatorial reflections are clearly evident in the diffraction pattern, indicating a distribution of angular orientations of the coherently scattering domains relative to the average N. Such a distribution reflects the curvature of the nematic director-field lines inside the bipolar droplet. By analyzing the azimuthal intensity profile of the wide-angle diffuse crescents we have obtained the distribution function of the nematic director in the droplet and determined the droplet order parameter S D <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The obtained value of S D is in excellent agreement with theoretical calculations. This represents the first experimental determination of such quantities that are of great importance in the characterization of the electrooptical behavior of PDLCs.  Examples of µ-XRD patterns of single smectic LC droplets (in PDLC samples with 8CB) are shown in figures 3 and 4. In particular, figure 4 clearly evidences the continuous rotation of the average orientation axis inside a large droplet. Work is still in progress for what concernes the complete interpretation of the µ-XRD data in smectic LC droplets.
