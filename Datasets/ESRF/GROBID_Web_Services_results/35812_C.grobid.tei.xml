<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims and background information</head><p>To examine the structure and organization of human corneal collagen as a function of tissue depth and to see how this changes between the cornea and the limbus. Our long -term aim is to build a 3-D model of corneal structure that will explain how the cornea maintains its precise shape, and what are the causes of shape changes following surgery.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head><p>Healthy human corneas were obtained from Eye Banks in the UK and USA. Strips of tissue extending from limbus to limbus were cut from central parts of the cornea and blocks of tissue were cut from different sites across the limbus. All these were sectioned into 100micron slices from anterior to posterior. The sections were scanned in two dimensions at Station ID -13, ESRF.</p><p>Whole corneas were mounted in air-tight chambers and using the same experimental set-up described above, microfocus x-ray scattering data were recorded at 25µm intervals along each of the 8 principal corneal meridians, in order to examine in detail the integration of the predominantly orthogonal collagen in the cornea, with the tangential/annular collagen at the limbus.</p><p>The remaining cornea was used to study the molecular structure of collagen as a function of tissue depth by cutting a thin vertical strip (≈1mm) and mounting it such that the beam crossed it edge-on. The microfocus beam allowed ~30 images to be taken from the front (epithelial) to the back (endothelial) surface of the cornea at 25µm intervals. When analysed, the data will allow us to determine the intermolecular spacing of the collagen as a function of depth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Our previous visit to ID13 was not successful as far as data collection is concerned, but did allow us to work out what experimental set-up was required for subsequent trips. However, the wideangle camera provided during the current trip yielded excellent results which, because a key team member went on Maternity leave, are still being analysed. Although we have not fully analysed all the data, the following preliminary results were obtained:</p><p>We will use our established WAXS analysis protocol to determine dominant collagen orientations throughout the sections. By analyzing the azimuthal distribution of intensity of the principal equatorial WAXS reflection (intermolecular collagen reflection), we will be able to quantify the relative number of collagen molecules lying in each direction within the corneal plane and thereby determine preferred directions of stromal collagen lamellae. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>WAXS patterns from 5 serial sections (see photo on right) from a ~2mm wide strip along the vertical corneal meridian Typical corneal WAXS pattern</figDesc></figure>
