<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Three different experiments were performed during this trip to the ESRF. The first one is from the main project in which my laboratory is involved at the "Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona" is the structural and functional characterization of the members of the SENP protease family, the protease family that cleaves the SUMO post-translational modification from protein substrates. The second and third projects are collaborations that my lab has stablished with two different gruops form my University.</p><p>Crystals from the complex between Senp6 and SUMO2 diffracted beyond 1.3 A resolution. Unfortunately the protein complex was not there, and only crystals containing SUMO2 were able to grow. This crystal form of SUMO2 has been previously published <ref type="bibr">(Huang et al., 2004</ref>. Crystal structures of the human SUMO-2 protein at 1.6 A and 1.2 A resolution: implication on the functional differences of SUMO proteins. Eur. J. Biochem. 4114-4122); so there is no need to pursue any longer with those crystals.</p><p>The second experiment performed is the diffraction of crystals from the carbamate kinase from Mycoplasma penetrans. This protein is involved in the arginine deiminase pathway. Crystals were cristallized with 0.1M HEPES 7.0, 2.0M Am Sulfate and 2% PEG400. One the DATA sets that were collected at the ID29 diffracted beyond 2.4 A. The cystals belonged to the P3221space group <ref type="bibr">( a=53.4, b=53.4, c=175.16, and a=b=90º g=120º)</ref>.</p><p>The DATA set was scaled with a final Rmerge of 0.037, I/sigma of 6.6 and 97% of completeness. The structure can be solved by molecular replacement using the CK structures 1B7B (E. faecalis) and 1E19 (P.furiosus) as a model. After the first cicles of refinement and rebuilding, an atomic model for the structure can be clearly observed with an Rfactor= 0.34 and a Rfree=0.39. The structure is waiting to be finally refined.</p><p>The third project that we took to the ESRF are the crystals of NMB1946, an outer membrane lipoprotein from the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. The protein can be potencially used as a target for a drug against this pathogen, this experiment belongs to an european anti-pathogen project. Crystals of NMB1946 were grown at 18 degrees by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method in following conditions 26% PEG8000, 0.1M Na acetate and 0.2M Li Sulfate, pH 4.5. Crystals were cryoprotected in a well solution that additionally contained 12 % glycerol. Data were collected at 100K, at beamline ID 29, ESRF, Grenoble.</p><p>Crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2A, belonged to I121 (C2) space group, with following unit cell characteristics (a, b, c; angles): 107.32 49.71 58.22; 90.00 122.77 90.00. Some important statistics includes: completness of 99.3%, Rmerge of 0.05 and I/sigma: 16.6. Structure was solved using molecular replacement method, where hypothetical protein PG110 (1p99) and membrane lipoprotein TpN32(1xs5) <ref type="bibr">(Williams et al. 2004 and</ref><ref type="bibr">Deka et al. 2004)</ref> were used as search models. Cycles of refinment yielded final R factor =18.6% and Rfree= 23.0%. Elucidation of the structure coincided with NMB1946 structure solved by another group (3gxa) being published <ref type="bibr">(Yang et al. 2009</ref>).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):David Reverter Group Leader.
