Upon heating the layers do not disappear though some of them seem to be more smeared probably due to diffusion, and in addition pores are formed mainly at the lens surafce, represented by dark spots in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>.</p><p>Analized Micro-XRF data showed two main prominent signals from Ca-Kalpha and Sr-Kalpha peaks. In addition efforts have been made to extract the signal of Mg-Kalpha but unfortunately its signal was too weak due to sample self absorption and air-absorbption. Reconstructed data indicated a radial elemental distribution along the sample perimeter both for Ca and Sr (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>In addition to the elemental distribution, signal intensity line plots in the radial direction indicated fluctuations of the elements which resembled to the fluctuations in intensity seen with the Holo-Tomography images.
