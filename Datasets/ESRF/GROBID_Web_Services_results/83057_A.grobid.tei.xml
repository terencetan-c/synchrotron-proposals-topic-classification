<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Our group successfully synthesized two CoFe Prussian Blue Analogs (PBAs; Co 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 2.7 and Rb 2 Co 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3.3 ) at the nanoscale by confining their growth into the porosity of mesoporous silica monolith. But some differences arose in their cristallographic and electronic structure and magnetic properties with respect to the macroscopic PBA, even if the photomagnetic properties of the macroscopic PBA are retained at the nanoscale. Therefore the goal of the experiment was to determine the electronic structure and local symmetry of the Co and Fe ions in the ground and exicted states of photomagnetic PBAs nanoparticles by high-energy resolution fluorescence detected XAS through a detailed analysis of the Fe and Co K pre-edge.</p><p>* The poster does not appear in the conference booklet because of deadline delay but it was displayed on a spare panel. It is however recorded in the database of the Users'meeting and is entitled "The Co and Fe speciation in PBAs and their derivaties: Evolution from the polymer down to the molecule"</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The proposal initially aimed at measuring the HERFD-XANES spectra of the macro-and nano-PBAs at room temperature and at 10K under light excitation using the new 1 crystal spectrometer of BM20, in order to probe both the ground and excited states. Nevertheless, not enough space was free around the spectrometer to install the minicryostat of the Sample Environment Support Service (and the required liquid He container). We thus decided to change the plan and we concentrated on room-temperature measurements but with an additional series of samples : molecular derivatives of CoFe-PBA; this choice enable to get three different sizes of the same PBA (a polymer with particles around 150-200 nm, nanoparticles of 5 nm and molecules of 5Å). We also investigated additional macroscopic PBA containing Cs and Na cations instead of Rb, in order to study the effect of the nature of the alkali cation; it is known to significantly impact the photomagnetic properties, but the reason is still unknown. The effect of the nature of the alkali cation was also investigated for the molecule. We could record HERFD-XAS spectra (monitoring the Kα 1 line) at both the Co and Fe K edges (using respectively a Si(440) and a Si(531) crystal) for all the samples, as well as RIXS planes at the Fe K-edge for 3 macroscopic PBA.</p><p>In the case of the size reduction effect, the comparision of the polymer, the nanoparticles and the molecule show significant differences in the speciation of both the Co and Fe ions. For instance, at the Fe K-edge, the single pre-edge peak for the 3 compounds is consistent with the expected low-spin state of the Fe II ions but for the molecule, the intensity of this pre-edge peak is more intense, indicating a more important distortion of the Fe site for the molecule with respect to the polymer and the nanoparticles. At the Co K-edge, the most significant differences arise between the nanoparticles and the 2 other compounds (polymer/molecule) : the white line is splitted, indicating two oxidation states for the Co ions in the nanoparticles, while both the molecule and the polymer contain only Co III ions. Nevertheless, the energy of the 1 st exafs feature is different for the 3 compounds, indicating a different Co-to-1 st neighbors distance.</p><p>In the case of the variaiton of the nature of the alkali cation inserted in the polymer PBA, the Fe K-edge spectra reveals an identical local environment for the Fe ions (also with a linear Co-NC-Fe linkage) whatever the alkali cation; the oxidation state is however different, with a +II oxidation state for the free-and Na-bearing PBAs and a +III one for the Cs and Rbbearing PBAs. Ath the Co K-edge, the differences are much more pronounced. The oxidation state is consistent with those of the Fe ions, with Fe II -Co III pairs for the free-and Na-bearing alkali cation PBAs and Fe II -Co III pairs for the Cs and Rb-bearing PBAs. The energy of the 1 st EXAFS peak also reveals longer Co-1 st neighbor distances for the Cs and Rb-bearing PBAs. The number of pre-edge features observed for this set of PBAs is consistent with the information deduced from the main edge. Interestingly, in the case of Rb and Cs alkalications in the polymer, the spectra at both edges are almost superimposed; this similarity is also observed for the molecules : the two Rb and Cs-bearing molecules display an identical speciation of both the Fe and Co ions in the two compounds.</p><p>To conclude, we have efficiently used this beamtime to investigate (i) the effect of size reduction on the electronic structure and local environment of the Fe and Co ions in macroscopic PBAs (polymer), nanoparticles and molecules, and (ii) the effect of the nature of the alkali cation (in polymer and molecule PBA). The stability of the beamline as well as the high quality of the spectrometer enables to record high-quality data. The initial measurements plan had to be adapted due to technical constraints (no space to combine the minicryostat with the 1 crystal spectrometer), but it enabled to record data on molecular PBA, which will enable to get a clearer picture of the size reduction effect on cristallographic and electronic structure. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>First</head><figDesc>results were presented at a poster at the ESRF Users'meeting 2018*, and an abstract was submitted to present more complete results at the XAFS conference in July 2018.</figDesc></figure>
