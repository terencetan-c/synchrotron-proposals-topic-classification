<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the following report, we are showing the results of the analysis of the Ni Transition metal-nitrogen-doped carbons (TMNC) system [1] using XAS and XES methods. The synchrotron based measurements were performed in operando conditions with the main purpose to track and differentiatiate among the different Ni-reaction intermediates and products appearing and evolving during the CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR).</p><p>For our experiments we used our single compartment electrochemical cell (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) suitable for X-ray spectroscopy experiments. The cell was oriented of 45° with respect to the incident beam, in order to maximise the detected fluorescence signal deriving from the sample and suppress the elastic scattering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The cell features a typical three electrode setup, represented by a reference (Ag/AgCl electrode), a counter (Pt mesh) and a working electrode. The latter consists of a carbon paper supports (Freudenberg H15C13, Fuel Cell Store) on which the sample was deposited as an ink through a spray-coating technique (ca. 1.6 ± 0.1 mg of catalysts per cm 2 ).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The measurements were performed in a CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte under a static current of -10 mA, corresponding to a current density of -15.7 mA/cm 2 . The applied current was controlled by a BioLogic potentiostat.</p><p>Ni K-edge high energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) X-ray absorption near edgestructure (XANES) and valence to core (vtc) Kβ2,5 X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) measurements were performed at the ESRF beamline ID26.</p><p>The storage ring operated in 7/8 multibunch mode with an electron current of 200 mA. Three undulators produced the incoming radiation, which was monochromatized by a pair of Si (111) crystals, cryogenically cooled. The energy calibration of the incident beam was done using a reference metallic Ni foil by setting the first reflection point of the Ni K edge to 8333 eV. HERFD XANES spectra were collected in a continuous scan mode by varying the incident energy from 8320 to 8450 over Ni K edge with an energy step 0.1 eV and duration 40 seconds per spectrum. The maximum of the Ni Kβ fluorescence line (8266.8 eV) was selected with an emission spectrometer in Rowland geometry with five Ge (620) analyzer crystals (R = 1 m) aligned at Bragg angel of 79.09°. The emission spectrometer was aligned using the elastic peak at Kβ fluorescence energy. Si avalanche photodiode (APD) with 200 μm thickness and 10 x 10 mm 2 active area was used as a detector. The position of the beam on the sample was changed after each scan to minimize the possible beam damage, where in total 12 spots have been probed in case of HERFD XANES and vtc-XES. Spectra were normalized by the incoming flux recorded by detecting the scattering from a Kapton foil with a photo diode.</p><p>As a first step of our investigation, we tried to follow the CO2RR reaction for one hour using HERFD XANES. The collected spectra were normalised for the absorption jump using the ATHENA software and are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. As it is possible to see, the spectra are affected by a low signal to noise ratio (in the flat region of the pre-edge between 8318 and 8330 eV the mean value of normalized spectrum is ca 0.006 with a standard deviation of 0.03) which can be attributed, mainly, to the low loading of Ni sites in the carbon matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>Nonetheless, we saw that the spectra quality was sufficient to enable the spectra interpretation using the principal component analysis (PCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The PCA analysis of the HERFD-XANES dataset of  while the fifth and furthere principal components encodes just experimental noise. In accordance with this evidence, we supposed the existence of four chemical species evolving during CO2RR conditions. Herein it is worth underlying that in our previous analysis performed on a similar catalysts (collected in conventional XAS mode at Bessy II -KMC 3 beamline) we found that the dataset could be represented by just three components <ref type="bibr">(Martini et al., in preparation)</ref>. We assumed then that the presence of an additional species could be associated to a radiation damage effect.</p><p>The extraction of the HERFD XANES spectra corresponding to each species was realised using the transformation matrix approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> as implemented in the PyFitIt code <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The MCR-ALS technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, that nowadyas is becoming very popular in the XAFS community, was also tried out, but was unable to reach a convergent solution using the dataset shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p><p>The XANES spectra, isolated by transformation matrix approach, and corresponding concentrations profiles are reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. The first component, identified by PCA and by the transformation matrix approach, can be associated with a six coordinated model where the Ni site is bound to four N atoms belonging, in turn, to a molecular ring composed by four pyridines in planar geometry, and to two axial O atoms. As the reaction proceeds the pyridines ring is further distorted and, progressively, the two O atoms are substituted by two CO ligands, giving rise to the second (five coordinated intermediate of reaction with one CO group) and third component (final state with a distorted octahedral geometry possessing two CO groups). The formation of the catalyst's final state is relatively fast and required just ten minutes.</p><p>Afterwards the contribution of the Ni species bound to the two CO groups is stabilised to a contant concentration value of ca. 30%.</p><p>The fourth component identified by the transformation matrix approach, coincides with the reference spectrum for Ni(OH)2 (β-form) spectrum and, as indicated before, we associate its presence to a beam effect. The formation of Ni(OH)2 had the largest impact on the concentration of Ni species bound to the two CO groups.</p><p>In order to obtain more insights on the catalysts speciation and in particular to validate the suggested structures, we acquired the Ni vtc-Kβ2,5 XES spectra of the sample in the initial state (in air before the reaction) and during CO2RR, respectively. The collected spectra are reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. The background of the all XES signals was removed using Voight functions with common interpolation ranges. Afterwards the background subtracted curves were normalised by their variance using the formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 (𝐸 𝑚𝑎𝑥 -𝐸 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) ⁄ ∫ 𝑋𝐸𝑆 2 (𝐸)𝑑𝐸 𝐸 𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝐸 𝑚𝑖𝑛</formula><p>, where the 𝐸 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐸 𝑚𝑖𝑛 are the extreme values of the selected energy range. We tried to confirm these finding by simulating the Ni vtc-Kβ2,5 XES spectra for these two states. To do so, following approach was used. First, we fitted the HERFD XANES spectra of the first and third component using the Machine</p><p>Learning indirect approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> and the FDMNES code for the construction of training datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) . The results of these fits are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> and agree well with the results found in our previous work <ref type="bibr">(Martini et al., in preparation)</ref>.</p></div>

FDM approach, as implemented in FDMNES code, was used for this purpse. Herein we broadened the unconvoluted XES spectra peaks with Gaussians functions having a FWHM value of 1.6 eV, corresponding to the energy resolution of the data acquisition evaluated taking the FWHM of the Kβ1,3 emission line. The intensities and the energy shift of the theoretical spectra were optimized by minimizing the quantity ‖𝑋𝐸𝑆(𝐸) -𝐶 • 𝑋𝐸𝑆(𝐸 + ∆𝐸) 𝑇𝐸𝑂 ‖ 2 , where 𝐶 and ∆𝐸 are the required constants needed to achive the highest similarity with the experiment, respectively.</p><p>We tested this approach before on a known compound, the Ni-Phthalocyanine (see Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>), that allowed us to confirm the realiability of the results obtained using the FDMNES code. the Ni sites in these two cases. The relative shift between the two spectra were obtained by shifting the two signals by their correspinding EPSII values plus an additional quantity obtained by centering the theoretical Ni-Phthalocyanine theretical spectrum with respect to the experiment.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Schematics of the electrochemical setup used for our measurements [2].</figDesc><graphic coords="3,176.00,36.85,248.36,232.45" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The grey dashed lines are indicating that the two vtc-XES peaks of the catalysts during CO2RR are not matching the ones of the Ni(OH)2. While from Figure 4(b) we expect a significant amount of Ni(OH)2 contributing to the sample-averaged data, , it is evident that the vtc-XES spectra, shown in Figure 5, collected for the initial state and during CO2RR, differ noticeably from the spectrum of Ni(OH)2.In particular the vtc-XES spectrum of the initial state shows two shoulders (the one at ca. 8.33 keV slighty more intense) corresponding to the main peaks of the Ni(OH)2 but also an additional feature peak where the Ni(OH)2 vtc-XES spectrum has a minimum point. Furthermore, the positions of two main peaks of vtc-XES spectrum collected during CO2RR do not match with the energies of the main features of Ni(OH)2. In addition, their intensity ratio is inverted compared to the latter. Overall, all these qualitative evidences indicate that the two states, in air and during CO2RR, can be linked to the two Ni complexes with different ligands and distortions, coexisitng with a Ni(OH)2 phase.</figDesc><graphic coords="6,170.00,95.63,260.35,224.24" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The two spectra have been simulated starting from the refined structures shown in Figure 6. Since the experimental XES spectra shown in Figure 5 are expected to contain significant Ni(OH)2 contributions, we decided to estimate the fractions of the two Ni single sites reported in the insets of Figure 6. These quantities were obtained by minimising the following quantity: ‖𝑋𝐸𝑆 𝑒𝑥𝑝 -𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙‖, where 𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 is defined as: 𝐶 • 𝑋𝐸𝑆 𝑡𝑒𝑜 + (1 -𝐶)𝑋𝐸𝑆 𝑁𝑖(𝑂𝐻) 2 , while 𝐶 is the concentration of the theoretical spectrum present in the bi-component mixture. No further energy shift was applied to the theoretical spectra. The result of this approach is reported in Figure 9, showing a good agreement between theoretical and experimnetal XES spectra. Iparticular, for the state during the CO2RR conditions, the concentration of the Ni species bound to the two CO groups obtained by the XES fit is 0.32. This value is very close to the average concentration value of this species, as obtained from HERFD XANES analysis in Figure 4(b) ( ca. 0.37).</figDesc><graphic coords="8,185.75,93.77,229.25,189.79" type="bitmap" /></figure>
