<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The beamtime allocated to proposal LS-2945 was used to measure ASAXS on Maltose-bindingprotein (MalE) labeled with two gold-nanoparticles. In the MalE mutants used, two amino-acids are replaced by cysteines gold nanoparticles are coupled via the thiol bond. Two different mutants were measured: MalE with cysteines at site 36 and 352 (MalE 36-352) and MalE with cysteines at site 31 and 212 . As a control we measured both mutants without nanoparticles. All measurements were performed in KCl-TRIS buffer at pH = 8.2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The double-labeled proteins were measured at 9 different energies around the the gold L-III absorption edge from 300 eV below to 50 eV above (all energies shown in the inset in Fig 1 <ref type="figure">a</ref>). The scattering curves were normalized and a correction for a residual fraction of single-labeled proteins was applied. We used a matrix inversion approach to isolate the gold-gold interaction term GAu (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) from the other scattering contributions. The distance distributions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) are calculated from the gold-gold term GAu by regularized Fourier transformation using a maximum entropy algorithm.</p><p>Although the purification of proteins labeled with gold is challenging and high concentrations were hard to obtain, we managed to experimentally determine label-label distance distributions for both proteins. The distance distrbution feature main peaks that match the expected distances from the known structure. For MalE 31-212 the main peak is at 6.2 nm (expected 6.1 nm) and for MalE 36-352 the main peak is at 5.8 nm (expected 5.7 nm). The distributions also feature two smaller peaks, one at around 1.5 nm, which resembles the size of the gold labels, and one at ~3.5 nm, which may arise from single labeled proteins or from protein aggregates connected by gold labels. The results from run LS-2945 demonstrate -for the first time-that it is possible to determine labellabel distances in proteins by ASAXS. We want to follow up on these highly encouraging results by measuring the same proteins with improved purification protocols; in addition, we want to perform measurements in the absence and presence of ligands to monitor conformational changes. We hope to again measure at beamtime ID02, which is uniquely suited for these demanding measurements. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Scattering Intensities at different energies, Gold-gold interference terms and distance distributions for MalE 36 -352 (a-c) and MalE 31-252 (d-f).
