<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to investigate the role of oriented attachment during the self-assembly of PbS nanocrystals into ordered superlattices. We have recorded large sets of diffraction patterns with 2dimensional grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS), grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXD) and x-ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental description:</head><p>The PbS nanocrystal samples were synthesized by a previously reported method. <ref type="bibr">[ACS Nano 2014, 8 (6)</ref>, 6363-6371] The nanocrystals were precipitated by the addition of anhydrous ethanol, the suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 4500 rpm, the supernatant discarded and the precipitate dissolved in anhydrous hexanes. It was washed two more times on adding anhydrous ethanol and one more time with acetone. Selfassembly was achieved by slow evaporation of the solvent from the nanocrystal suspension placed on a plane Si wafer of 1 cm x 1 cm as substrate at room temperature. In a typical preparation, 500 μl of PbS nanocrystal hexane dispersion (0.5 mg/mL) were mixed with 50 μL of toluene in a vial. The vial was loosely capped with a wet lid with hexane and the solvent allowed to evaporate at room temperature for at least 16 h. For GISAXS, the X-ray beam impinged under a grazing angle of 0.2° on the sample surface and the scattering pattern was detected using a 2D Pilatus 300K detector at a distance of 170 cm from the sample. The energy of X-rays was 12.9 keV. GIXD and XRR scans were recorded at the same energy using a MaxiPix detector. For GIXD, an incidence angle of 0.1 deg -i.e. well above the critical angle of total external reflectionwas used.</p><p>The respective resolutions taking into account the beam size and the pixel to pixel distance were 0.05 deg corresponding to 0.0055 Å -1 for the laterally slitted down Maxipix detector ("GIXD regime") -i.e. the inplane resolution of the line scans in the GIXD regime made via moving the delta arm (i.e. detector horizontal angle arm). For XRR, the data was recorded in specular geometry and corrected for the background as well as the beam footprint.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>We use the organic semiconductor tetrathiafulvalene dicarboxylate (TTFDA) to assemble PbS nanocrystals into conductive mesocrystals. Density functional theory calculations predict a size-tunable, near-resonant alignment between the PbS 1Sh state and the TTFDA HOMO with the potential to form a conductive channel for holes. We test this hypothesis with transport measurements on TTFDA-functionalized PbS nanocrystals of different sizes and find a pronounced modulation of the field-effect hole mobilities. Photothermal deflection spectroscopy reveals unchanged Urbach energies after ligand exchange, whereas further surface modification by colloidal-atomic layer deposition leads to a strong increase in the density of in-gap states.</p><p>Hole transport in PbS-TTFDA is unusually robust against such surface modification. Our structural analysis of the mesocrystals suggests that TTFDA induces a defined interparticle spacing, the orientation of atomic lattices and the angle within the mesocrystal unit cell. The results of this work pave the way towards conductive mesocrystalline assemblies of hybrid semiconductor nanostructures with size-tunable transport properties.</p><p>The majority of the remaining results have formed the foundation for another manuscript, which is currently under review (submitted on 16/02/2016): Novak, J.; Banerjee, R; Kornowski, A.; Jankowski, M.; André, A.; Weller, H.; Schreiber, F.; Scheele, M. The Role of Oriented Attachment in the Tetragonal Distortion of PbS Nanocrystal Superlattices and the Occurrence of the Honeycomb Phase. Submitted.</p><p>In this mansucript, we analyze the structure and morphology of mesocrystalline, body-centered tetragonal (bct) superlattices of PbS nanocrystals functionalized with oleic acid, and the crucial factors which favor an assembly into a honeycomb superlattice of NCs. Our GISAXS measurements taken at ID03 have enabled us to resolve the full 3D structure of superlattices of PbS nanocrystals self-assembled under the conditions specified above. Fitting of the data (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) revealed a tetragonal distortion and, thus, a bct structure. Lattice parameters were extracted and good agreement with electron microscopy results was obtained. The XRR results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) have allowed us to determine the preferred orientation of the superlattice normal to the plane. This information has previosuly been unaccessible to us since our preliminary electron microscopy studies could only provide information about the xy-plane, but not in zdirection. Reflectivity measurements of nanocrystal films are often challenging due to the relatively rough sample surfaces owing to the typically applied "evaporation-induced assembly from solution" (EISA-process). However, our data shows several Bragg peaks, even with higher oder, demonstrating that such measurements are indeed possible on nanoparticle films.</p><p>With GIXD, we have not only corroborated our analysis of the GISAXS data, but also revealed valuable new details about the structure of the surfactants which are typically found between the individual nanocrystals of the superlattice: As highlighted in our submitted manuscript, we now have evidence that periodic structures (found around 1.4 A -1 in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) of oleic acid play a pivotal role in the occurrence of a honeycomb lattice of PbS after self-assembly from solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outreach:</head><p>Experiment SC-4033 has been highly successful in that 1) one publication has already resulted from the beamtime; 2) another publication is currently under review; 3) our results provide valuable new insights for the controlled design of honeycomb superlattices of nanocrystals which may play an important role for electronics as topological insulators; and 4) our results published in Chem. Mater. demonstrate that it is possible to obtain conductive, mesocrystalline superlattices of PbS nanocrystals, which allow for the fabrication of devices consisting of PbS superlattices. These novel materials potentially hold for new optoelectronic properties due to the defined, mutual orientation of the individual nanocrystals. The next step in this direction would be the structural characterization of bilayers of such materials in order to construct more complex device architectures like solar cells or LEDs. Such investigations are the core subject of proposal ref.</p><p>-nr. 52186, submitted by some of the proposers of the present experiment on 01/03 2016. The results and experience with the material reported on here will greatly facilitate such upcoming studies and ensure their successful execution.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
