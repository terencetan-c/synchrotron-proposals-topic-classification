Simionovici et A.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of experiment CH-626 was to dose U and Au in single fluid inclusion (microcavities 10 to 50 micrometers containing a fluid phase responsible for the transport and concentration of matter in the Earth's Crust). Dosage of gold was a continuation of a previous experiment (CH-475 performed in April 98) during which we obtained a markedly defined Au peak from a fluid inclusion from the Pont-de-Rastel deposit. We aimed at confirming this fundamental result in a variety of other Au-deposit from Australia, USA and Morocco, which contain one of the most important Au-deposit worlwilde. Dosage of U was a new project, with important implications on radioactive waste disposal and U-deposit exploration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gold :</head><p>We were not able to find gold in any of the sample investigated. Performing a 2D map of the fluid inclusion from Pont-De-Rastel that contained gold, we showed that gold was markedly localised in the fluid inclusion and could not be representative of a specy in solution, rather as a minute gold grain (less than 1 micron in size) that was impossible to visualize using an optical microscope. Nevertheless, in all samples investigated we were able to dose a variety of trace metals such as Cu, Zn, Sr, Rb, Ba, Ti, Br...; it is the first time that such elements are founds in individual inclusions. These results can be considered as representative of a state-of-the-art analytical development. In addition, recognition that the gold grain was trapped in a first generation fluid population indicated that gold deposition occurred during an early stage of the hydrothermal history of the Pont-de-Rastel deposit, an observation in marked opposition with most models proposed for the generation of Au-deposit during variscan age (about 300 Million years) in Europe...</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Uranium:</head><p>3 samples collected among the most important U-deposit worlwilde were analyzed for their U in solution in individual fluid inclusion. These are: Streltsovka deposit (Russia), Caramal deposit (Australia) and Oklo deposit (Gabon). (I remind here that although we know how to found U-and Au-deposit on the basis of empirical observations, we do not understand the mechanisms by which trace metals transported and concentrated through the crust.)</p><p>In one of the sample from Russia, we found U, Zr, Sr, Rb, Pb, La in solution (confirmed by 2D maps, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and see also Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> of the attached Proposition form). This finding is of major importance and as tremendeous environmental, energetic and economic implications (Zr, Sr and Pb all form as fission product of U). Perhaps more important is that in one of the spectrum we suspect the presence of I and Cs in small amounts (see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> of the experiment proposal attached). Isotopes of both elements form as fission product of U, and are of great environmental concern.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> </p></div>		</body>
