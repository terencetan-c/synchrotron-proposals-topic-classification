<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>By and large, the goals stated in the application ("milestones MD 72") were reached. Ten peer-reviewed publications (see list below) have been produced as a result of this beam time (77 shifts, of a total of 96 shifts that were awarded).</p><p>1. New Multi-Slit Collimator TECOMET ® (TMSC): physical performance, biological effects: The physical performance of the adjustable TMSC (1) and some novel irradiation geometries enabled by its design have been reported (2). Biological effects, "milestone MD 72" : "Availability of sufficient computational and experimental data to select the optimal microbeam parameters for delivering palliative/therapeutic doses that are below the threshold for damage to the normal adult rat brain, as a guide for clinical phase I trials in humans...." Much progress was made toward achieving this goal. Table <ref type="table">I</ref> indicates the preliminary biological results for normal tissues. Not only do the individual microplanar beam width and beam skin-entrance dose play very important roles, but the spacing of microplanes and the macroscopic dimensions of the array of microbeams do too. The observed imperfect inverse correlation of spacing with the valley dose for a given set of parameters requires further experimental study in vivo as well as extended Monte Carlo studies. Histopathologic review of microbeam-irradiated brains is in progress. A systematic investigation of parameters that can be varied to optimize the therapeutic index for tumor palliation was started in November 2005. We used the transplantable murine squamous cell carcinoma SCC VII (3, see § 5A below). These studies will be extended with a goal of being able to predict normal tissue toxicity in the tumor-bearing mouse leg on the basis of MRT parameters -an important, perhaps essential step toward clinical MRT.</p></div>

CTCAE score = 1 denotes a mild Adverse Event of negligible clinical significance; score 5 denotes a most severe Adverse Event (fatality) caused in large part by the irradiation. Valley dose = brain dose midway between the two microbeams at the middle of the array of vertical microbeams, computed using the GEANT Monte-Carlo photon-electron transport program (5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Permeabilization of the blood-brain barrier by MRT</head><p>Sub-radiotherapeutic doses of broad-beam photon radiation can promote the diffusion of some agents from the blood to tissues, and increase the toxicity of these agents in their therapeutic targets. The purpose was to develop microbeam-targeted cytotherapy to prevent or palliate acute and delayed neuroradiotoxicity after high-dose, potentially curative radiosurgery. Efforts to achieve this goal comprise experiments with Nanogold and a collaborative study in mice. Serduc and co-workers (6) irradiated parts of the cortex of a brain hemisphere in nude mice anteroposteriorly with an array of vertical, parallel microplanar beams (width ~ 25 µm, spacing ~210 µm, entrance dose 312 or 1000 Gy). The vascular volume in the irradiated portion of the brain was estimated in vivo. The vascular permeability was detected as extravasation of sulforhodamine B (577 Da) in the irradiated microplanar tissue slices. For all time intervals after MRT and after either 312 or 1000 Gy, FITC-dextran (70 kDa) remained in the functional vessels. No significant change in vascular volume was observed. After exposure to 1000 Gy, diffusion of sulforhodamine B in microbeam stripes was observed from 12h until 12 days after MRT, but no diffusion was detected 1 month after MRT. A permeability of the BBB for small molecules occurs between 12h and 12 days and fades between 12 and 30 days after irradiation. In the light of these observations made in vivo, it is understandable in retrospect that intravenously injected Nanogold particles with diameters of ~80 nm (i.e., ~10 x the diameter of human albumin in solution) were not detected in histologic sections of the brain at various intervals after MRT-crossfired irradiation of a mouse left cerebral white matter volume of ~4 mm 3 using entrance doses up to 1250 Gy. At necropsy, the gold nanoparticles were detected in Kupffer cells of the livers of these mice. 4. Chorio-allantoic membrane of chicken (CAM): "Milestone: Demonstration of the conditions under which the microbeam effect can be observed in the CAM model." Salient results for the CAM have been published <ref type="bibr">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9)</ref>. A single, 25 µm-wide microplanar beam (entrance dose 2500-5000 Gy) causes minimal capillary damage. Multiple microplanar beams (width 27 µm, spacing 207 µm) cause capillary damage in the tracks of the beams. 24 h after application of entrance doses of 300 Gy, some repair has taken place, and the perfusion is being maintained. Entrance doses of 600 Gy lead to marked microvascular damage and perfusion loss. For broad beam irradiation, the threshold dose for microvascular damage/perfusion loss is ~10 Gy.</p></div>

Extension of the LTP: a transplantable squamous cell carcinoma in mice: The left tibiofibular thigh of a mouse bearing a subcutaneously [sc] implanted mouse model of aggressive human squamous-cell carcinoma [SCC VII] was irradiated in two orthogonal exposures through a multislit collimator [MSC] by arrays of nearly parallel microbeams spaced 200 µm on center [oc]. The peak skin-entrance dose from each exposure was 442, 625, or 884 Gy from 35 µmwide beams or 442 Gy from 70 µm-wide beams. The 442/35, 625/35, 884/35 and 442/70 MRTs yielded 25-, 29-, 37-and 35-day median survival times [MST] (post-irradiation), respectively, exceeding the 20-day MST from 35 Gy-irradiation of SCC VIIs with a seamless 100 kVp X-ray beam (3). In a follow-up study ( <ref type="bibr">Nov. 2005)</ref>, a new setup to reduce radiation backscatter, as well as 200 µm spacing oc, entrance doses of 625 or 884 Gy (35 µm-wide beams), and 884 Gy (20 µmwide beams), and spacing of 400 m oc with entrance doses of 884 Gy or 1250 Gy (35 µm-wide beams), and 625 Gy (20 µm-wide beams), was used. Spacing of 400 µm oc rather than 200 µm oc greatly reduced the efficacy of tumor palliation. Increasing the entrance doses or widening the microbeams while maintaining the 400µm on-center beam separation did not compensate for that reduction. A related long-term histopathologic study is in progress (12).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.B. Synergy of Gene-Mediated Immunoprophylaxis and Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) for Advanced</head><p>Intracerebral Rat 9L Gliosarcomas. This report ( <ref type="formula">13</ref>) is the first demonstration that gene-mediated immunotherapy (GMIMPR) enhances the efficacy of MRT for advanced 9L GSs. Male Fischer 344 rats were implanted intracerebrally (ic) with 10 4 9L GS cells on day (d) 0. Each of the 14 untreated (control) rats died from a large (&gt;100 mg) ic tumor before d29 (median, d21). On d14, the remaining 62 rats were given deliberately suboptimal microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) by a single lateral exposure of the tumor-bearing zone of the head that delivered 625 Gy peak skin doses at ~211 µm oc intervals in ~300 ms either without additional treatments (MRT-only, 25 rats), with post-MRT GMIMPR (=multiple sc injections of irradiated (clonogenically-disabled) GM-CSF gene-transfected 9L GS cells), or with post-MRT IMPR (multiple sc injections of irradiated (clonogenically-disabled) 9L GS cells. The median post-implantation survivals of rats in the MRT-only, MRT+GMIMPR and MRT+IMPR groups were over twice that of controls; further, ~20% of rats in MRT-only and MRT+IMPR groups survived &gt;1 yr with no obvious disabilities. In addition, over 40% of MRT+GMIMPR rats survived &gt;1 yr with no obvious disabilities, a significant (p &lt;.04) increase over the MRT-only and MRT+IMPR groups. These data suggest that a MRT+GMIMPR combination might be better than MRT alone to palliate a unifocal glioma.</p><p>6. MRT of spontaneous tumors in large animal patients (dogs, cats) Status: The first preliminary study is scheduled for February 2006. Veterinarian and ethical safeguards have been met. Our collaborator Prof. Barbara Kaser-Hotz, DVM, Veterinary Hospital, University of Zurich, a veterinary oncologist experienced in treating spontaneous canine and feline neoplasms (14), obtained Swiss authorization Nr. 160/2005 on October 31, 2005 to perform MRT for canine and feline brain tumors. The authorization, valid until November 30, 2007, has been issued by the Department of Public Health, Canton of Zurich, Veterinary Office, by the Cantonal Veterinarian, Regula Vogel, DVM. However, corresponding authorizations from the ESRF and, in particular, technical specifications for radiation and biohazard safety during and after large-animal MRT, have not yet been issued by the ESRF. Thus, in February, we plan to conduct extensive tests with canine/feline irradiation phantoms, including anesthesia, positioning, dosimetry etc. The project, recently presented at internal reviews at the ESRF and at a scientific meeting (15) has been rated as important and experts have recommended that such spontaneous tumors in large mammals be studied before clinical trials in humans are implemented.
