<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The direct lyotropic polymorphism of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) was investigated by synchrotron X-ray diffraction at different water concentrations under compression up to 2 kbar, i.e., in the pressure intermediate range where interesting biophysical transformations occur and the functional characteristics of cell membranes are altered. The results show that pressure induces the transition from the hexagonal phase to the micellar Pm3n cubic phase in hydrated samples (c between 0.5 and 0.6, c being the weight concentration of lipid in the mixture) and the transition from the bicontinuous Ia3d cubic phase to the hexagonal phase in drier samples (c ) 0.8). By increasing the pressure on very dry samples, a lamellar L R phase was observed to form transitorily at the Ia3d cubic-hexagonal phase transition. Phase compressibility and then the lipid and water partial molecular compressibilities were derived as a function of pressure and concentration. As a result, we assessed the very low compressibility of the hydration water within the lipid phases, and we demonstrated that the compressibility of DTAC is very dependent on pressure. Moreover, the molecular parameters of DTAC calculated in the different phases during compression confirmed that pressure induces small but continuous conformational changes, definitely different from the large changes observed in lipid molecules forming type II structures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Introduction</head><p>Over the past decade, the application of hydrostatic pressure has become an interesting tool for analyzing structural properties and phase behavior of biological molecules and systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2</ref> In particular, quite relevant are studies at intermediate pressures, as the range where interesting biophysical transformations occur (like protein denaturation, oligomer dissociation, helix-coil transition in nucleic acids, bacteria inactivation) is typically 0.1-0.5 GPa and very rarely up to 1 GPa (pressures in the range from 1 to several kilobars are called medium or intermediate pressures. 1 kbar ) 0.1 GPa). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> In this context, remarkable results have been obtained in inverse (type II, water-in-oil) lipid systems. A number of different phase transitions was observed to occur at intermediate pressures, as, for example, the hexagonal-to-lamellar phase transition detected in hydrated dioleyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref> and the cubic-to-cubic and cubic-to-lamellar phase transitions detected at different concentrations in the monolein/ water system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> Moreover, the unit cell compressibility in the inverse phase has been firmly established to be negative (i.e., pressure induces an increase of the unit cell dimension). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> However, the pressure dependence of the lattice constants was observed to be larger for structures occurring in excess of water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Simple molecular packing arguments, based on pressure-induced changes in the basic geometrical wedge shape of the lipid molecules, were exploited to account for these features, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> but a change in the hydration level was also associated to the shape variation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> In inverse lipid systems, structural data obtained in the biologically relevant range were also helpful to derive information on the stability of the lipid layer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Using a free energy model based on curvature elastic contributions, we demonstrated that in monoolein the monolayer spontaneous curvature tends to zero when the pressure increases, but we argued that the bending elasticity is not prevailing in the total free energy of the system under compression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> More recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> we reported that the isothermal lateral compression constant in dioleyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine monolayer is practically independent of concentration, while it increases as a function of pressure. Howerver, changes in the bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature of the monolayer suggested that, as the pressure increases, the lipid chain repulsion becomes relatively weaker, and thereby less efficient in balancing the torque of headgroup repulsion.</p><p>Owing to their topology, medium-pressure effects on direct (type I, oil-in-water) lipid phases are expected to be quite different from those observed in inverse phases. However, direct systems have been only sparingly investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> Structural investigations in the pressure range 0.001-4 kbar concerned, for example, the critical micelle concentration (cmc) of ionic and nonionic surfactants in aqueous solutions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11</ref> The initial compression was observed to cause the dissociation of micelles, whereas successive compression above a certain pressure causes aggregation of monomers to micelles again, suggesting that the partial molecular volume change on micellation is positive in the lower pressure region and negative for the higher pressures.</p><p>The similar characteristic pressure dependence of the cmc for both ionic and nonionic surfactants, as well as the existence of an alkyl chain length dependence for ionic surfactants, suggested that the effect of pressure is largely independent of the hydrophilic headgroup of the surfactant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> Concentrated micellar systems and microemulsions were also analyzed under compression, and changes in aggregation number and the formation of aggregate structures with smaller partial molecular volumes of their amphiphiles were revealed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> In some cases, pressureinduced phase transitions from droplet structures or from rodlike micelles to lamellar phases were also detected. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> These data clearly indicate that already relatively low pressures can lead to drastic changes in structure and topology of type I lipid systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> In this work, we extend high-pressure structural investigations to concentrated lipid systems, considering the special case of the dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) in water, which exhibits an extended direct lyotropic polymorphism at atmospheric pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> The temperature-concentration dependent phase diagram of DTAC is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>: it can be observed that the central region is characterized by the presence of a direct hexagonal H phase, while a micellar Pm3n cubic phase extends between the hexagonal and the isotropic fluid phases, and a Ia3d bicontinuous cubic phase occurs in the drier side of the phase diagram. Furthermore, in the very dehydrated conditions, a lamellar liquid crystalline phase exists. The schematic representation of the lyotropic phases occurring in the DTAC/water system is reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The Pm3n cubic phase is the first example among lipids of a structure containing elements of more than one form. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref> Its structure consists of two types of disjointed micelles of type I, embedded in a continuous water matrix. The eight micelles contained in the unit cell belong to two different classes: two are globular and located at the corner and in the center of the cubic cell (referred to as positions a), while six are disk-shaped and located on the cell faces at positions c. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> Since the lipid component is chemically homogeneous, it was concluded that the area per molecule values are the same in the two types of micelles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> The hexagonal H phase consists of a hexagonal array of infinitely long cylinders, filled by the hydrocarbon chains, coated with the DTAC polar headgroups, and embedded in the water matrix. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> The Ia3d cubic phase is bicontinuous and can be described in terms of two three-dimensional (3D) networks of joined rods, mutually intertwined and unconnected. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> The rods are filled by the hydrocarbon chains, have equal length, and are 3 × 3 coplanarly joined.</p><p>In the present study, the polymorphism of DTAC at intermediate pressures was analyzed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction at water concentrations ranging from 40 to 90 weight lipid % under hydrostatic pressures up to 2 kbar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Materials and Methods</head><p>DTAC (99.0% purity) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The DTAC/water system was analyzed in a concentration range spanning from c ) 0.45 to c ) 0.90. Samples were prepared by mixing the lipid with the required amounts of bidistilled water and were equilibrated for 1 day at ambient temperature and pressure. The relative concentration uncertainty was estimated to be 5%. No water loss was detected before the lipid mixtures were mounted into the pressure cell. Moreover, after the X-ray scattering experiments, the water composition of each sample was checked again by gravimetric analysis. The difference between the nominal concentration and the one measured after the pressure cycle was detected to be within the limit of the experimental error. The lipid volume concentration at ambient pressure was determined from the nominal weight composition c and the known specific volumes of the two components (ν L ) 1.103 cm 3 /g and ν W ) 1.0 cm 3 /g).</p><p>Diffraction experiments were performed at the ID02 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, ESRF, Grenoble (France), using a SAXS-WAXS setup. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> The wavelength of the incident beam was λ ) 1 Å, and the investigated Q-range was between 0.03 and 0.6 Å -1 (Q ) 4π sin θ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle) on the SAXS detector and between 2.8 and 13.2 Å -1 on the WAXS detector. For high-pressure measurements, a NovaSwiss pressure-control system was used. The pressure cell has two diamond windows (3.0 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness) and allows measurement of diffraction patterns at hydrostatic pressures up to 3 kbar.</p><p>X-ray diffraction measurements were performed at 25 °C for different pressures, from 1 bar to about 2 kbar, with steps of about 100 bar. To avoid radiation damage, the exposure time was kept as low as 0.2-1 s/frame, and a fast beam shutter was used to protect the sample from irradiation when data were not being acquired. Particular attention was paid to checking for equilibrium conditions and monitoring radiation damage. Measurements were repeated several times (up to 10) at the same constant pressure to account for stability in position and intensity of the Bragg peaks. Accordingly, a gentle compression of the sample, at a rate of 0.5-2 bar/s, was sufficient to establish equilibrium conditions, including in the regions of phase  coexistence. In all cases, once the pressure got stabilized (within a few minutes), measurements were repeated at least twice, with a dead time of about 5 min. Since the scattering was isotropic, the data corrected for background, detector inhomogeneities, and sample transmission were radially averaged.</p><p>In each experiment, a number of sharp reflections were detected in the low-angle X-ray diffraction region and their spacings measured following the usual procedure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> SAXS profiles were indexed by considering the different symmetry systems commonly observed in lipid phases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> In particular, DTAC samples showed four different series of Bragg reflections, indexed according to the 1D lamellar symmetry (spacing ratios 1:2:3 ...), the 2D hexagonal space group (spacing ratios 1: 3: 4: 7 ...), the 3D Pm3n cubic space group (spacing ratios 2: 4: 5: 6: 8: 10 ...), and the 3D Ia3d cubic space group (spacing ratios 6: 8: 14: 16: 20: 22 ...). From the peak positions, the dimensions of the unit cell were calculated.</p><p>In the wide-angle region, a diffuse band was detected at all the investigated concentrations and pressures, indicating the disordered (type R) nature of the lipid short-range conformation. 17</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. Results</head><p>X-ray diffraction experiments were performed at room temperature, at different water concentrations and pressures. Typical diffraction patterns are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. In the lowangle region, 3 up to 10 peaks (depending on sample concentration) were observed. Under all the investigated conditions, the spacings of the peaks were unambiguously indexed. Even in the coexistence regions, the indexing problem was easy to solve, because no extra peaks, which can be ascribed to the presence of unknown phases or to crystalline structures, were observed.</p><p>A. Phase Diagram. The X-ray diffraction profiles indicate that pressure-induced phase behavior depends on sample composition. From the observed changes, the pressureconcentration phase diagram reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> has been derived. According to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> the Pm3n cubic phase is detected in the more hydrated region (i.e., from c ) 0.4 to c ) 0.5). Under compression, diffraction data indicate a large stability of this phase, as no transition occurs up to 2 kbar. In the intermediate concentration region, from c ) 0.52 to c ) 0.8, the hexagonal phase is observed at ambient pressure.</p><p>However, in the more hydrated conditions (c between 0.52 and 0.58), the Pm3n cubic phase forms during compression. Noticeable is the fact that the cubic phase coexists with the H phase in a large pressure interval: as the intensities and positions of the diffraction peaks measured at constant pressure do not change as a function of time, while the intensities of the H characteristic peaks decrease as a function of pressure and the intensities of those related to the Pm3n phase increase, it can be concluded that the two phases are in a thermodynamic equilibrium.</p><p>At low hydration (from c ) 0.8 to c ) 0.9), the presence of the Ia3d cubic phase at ambient pressure is confirmed. X-ray diffraction profiles measured as a function of pressure point out that compression induces the transition to the H phase. However, it should be underlined that the pressure at which the transition occurs depends on concentration. In particular, the range of stability of the Ia3d cubic phase at high pressure increases with dehydration. Moreover, the Ia3d-H phase transition is accompanied by the formation of a transient lamellar phase. It is interesting to note that the lamellar phase forms a few hundred bars before the appearance of the H phase and disappears after the disappearance of the Ia3d cubic phase, suggesting that the transition is associated to local changes in sample composition.</p><p>Finally, in the drier samples (c &gt; 0.9), the Ia3d cubic phase appears stable against pressure, even if the formation of a stable lamellar phase at c ) 0.95 is stated at the high pressures.</p><p>B. Phase Compressibility. Unit cell dimensions were calculated from the positions of the diffraction peaks. A few  results are reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> to illustrate the general trend: in all cases, the unit cell shrinks during compression, even if the pressure dependence is very week. Note that the behavior observed in inverse phases was basically opposite: In both type II hexagonal and cubic phases, the unit cell dimensions were found to strongly increase under compression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref> A linear fit to the lattice dimensions measured on single phase domains served the purpose of calculating a rough value of the unit cell pressure dependence, da/dp. As it can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, da/dp depends on the structure of the phase and reduces within the same phase as the water content decreases. In particular, da/dp values range from about -0.6 to -0.7 Å kbar -1 in the Pm3n cubic phase, from -0.2 to -0.8 Å kbar -1 in the H phase, and from -1.0 to -1.2 Å kbar -1 in the Ia3d cubic phase. The comparison with the (positive) values of 1.3 Å kbar -1 and 1.0 Å kbar -1 observed in the lamellar phases of DOPE <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6</ref> and monolein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> respectively, or with the (positive) values of 1.6 Å kbar -1 , about 4 Å kbar -1 , and about 5-7 Å kbar -1 observed in the DOPE inverse H phase and in the monoolein bicontinuous Pn3m and Ia3d cubic phases, respectively, clearly confirms that in direct lipid phases the pressure-induced behavior is definitively different.</p><p>The volume variations of the 2D hexagonal and 3D cubic phases under pressure were then used to derive the relative isothermal compressibilities. In the cubic phase, the isothermal compressibility is defined as the negative pressure derivative of the corresponding unit cell volume, V, at constant temperature where T is the absolute temperature, p the pressure, and β 3D ) -V -1 (∂V/∂p) T the coefficient of 3D isothermal compressibility. In the hexagonal phase, information about the length of the cylinders cannot be obtained from data; therefore, the isothermal compressibility is defined as the negative pressure derivative of the area of the hexagonal primitive 2D cell at constant temperature, σ ) a 2 3/2 where β 2D ) σ -1 (∂σ/∂p) T is the coefficient of 2D isothermal compressibility.</p><p>By visually inspecting the data, a quadratic dependence has been considered to calculate the pressure derivatives: β 3D and β 2D points are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>, together with the coefficient of isothermal compressibility of the water <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> reported as reference. The isothermal compressibility coefficients of the three lipid phases are positive and decrease with pressure. Moreover, they are systematically lower than those of bulk water. Owing   </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">K T,3D ) β 3D V ) -( ∂V ∂p ) T (1) K T,2D ) β 2D σ ) -( ∂σ ∂p ) T (2)</formula><p>to the differences in the hydrogen bond networks in a confined space, water within the lipid phase appears to exhibit a compressibility (and hence a density) substantially different from the one characteristic of the bulk. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> also show that the compressibilities in the various phases behave similarly, even if their values are clearly dependent on hydration. The concentration dependence of the coefficients of isothermal compressibility measured at constant pressure is reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> (as explained below, in this figure compressibility data are plotted as a function of the calculated pressure-dependent lipid volume concentration, φ L , proportional to c). The points are scattered, but the general trend suggests that an increased hydration leads to a continuous decrease in compressibility, even when phase boundaries are crossed (the Pm3n-H phase transition occurs at φ L around 0.58, while the H-Ia3d at about 0.82). Electrostriction of solvent around charged and polar groups could account for this behavior. We ought to observe that experimental results regarding the structure of the protein-water interface point to the existence of a first hydration shell with an average density 10% larger (and, as a possible consequence, a compressibility smaller) than that of bulk water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> The comparison with other studies suggested that this may be a general property of aqueous interfaces. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> C. Molecular Compressibility. According to the structural properties of a lipid phase, the partial DTAC and water compressibilities have been determined. Following Luzzati's model, it has been assumed that water is excluded from the regions where the hydrocarbon chains are clustered, while the hydrophilic groups of the lipid molecules cover the interface between the water and paraffin moieties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref> The two topologically distinct volumes, corresponding to the lipid and aqueous moieties, are V L ) φ L V and V W ) (1φ L )V, respectively. The net sample volume change induced by pressure, ∆V, can be then written as a sum of two components, ∆V L and ∆V W : <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> ∆V L depends on the properties of the lipid moiety and includes the changes in the partial volume of the solute as well as any change in the interstitial volume owing to interactions of the solute with the solvent; ∆V W arises from changes in the water partial volume.</p><p>The phase compressibility (β ) β 3D ) β 2D ; see eqs 1 and 2) can be then related to the partial compressibility of the two components by where β L and β W are the coefficients of isothermal partial compressibility of the lipid and water moieties, respectively (by definition, β L and β W are also the isothermal partial molecular compressibility of the lipid and the water, respectively).</p><p>Due to the differences in the hydrogen bond networks in confined spaces, we expect that the compressibility of water confined in the lipid phase is different from that in the bulk. However, the situation could be more complicated in highly hydrated conditions, where only a fraction of the water directly interacts with the lipid polar surfaces. Consequently, β W in eq 3 shoud be considered the average coefficient of isothermal partial (molecular) compressibility of the water in the lipid phase.</p><p>By means of an iterative analysis, β L and β W were derived from data in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. Following the original Tait equation (also known as linear secant modulus equation), <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> the pressure dependence of β i can be described by a two-parameter equation where β°i is the molecular compressibility at zero pressure and η i ≡ (∂β i -1 /∂p) p)0 is the first derivative of the isothermal bulk modulus at the same pressure. Therefore, the pressure dependence of the molecular volume of the ith species can be obtained by integrating eq 4 (V°i is the molecular volume at the zero pressure). This calculation is particularly relevant, as any change in lipid and water compressibility and volume reflects in changes of the sample volume concentration.</p><p>The approach has been the following: (i) compressibility data of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> were plotted as a function of the lipid volume concentration φ L calculated at ambient pressure; (ii) a first set of coefficients of partial molecular compressibility, β L and β W , and the pair β°i and η i were derived by fitting data using eqs 3 4; (iii) the DTAC and water molecular volumes at different pressures were calculated from the pair β°i and η i by using eq 5. From molecular volumes, the lipid volume concentration was then calculated for each sample as a function of p; (iv) the compressibility data of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> were replotted as a function of the pressure-dependent lipid volume concentration and (v) these data were again fitted using eq 3 and eq 4 to obtain a new set of coefficients of partial molecular compressibility and a new pair β°i and η i . The procedure from steps (iii)-(v) was repeated until both water and DTAC partial compressibilities converged to stable values.</p><p>The lines reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> are the best fit curves to the compressibility data plotted as a function of the calculated pressure-dependent lipid volume concentration. The coefficients of isothermal partial molecular compressibility derived for DTAC and water molecules are reported as a function of pressure in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. As expected, water confined inside the lipid phase exhibits an unusually low compressibility, from 3 to 10 times lower than the compressibility observed in the bulk. Moreover, the DTAC compressibility appears to be heavily dependent on pressure: inasmuch as lipid compressibility represents a measure of intermolecular interactions, the observed behavior is arguably the signature of the tightness of intrinsic hydrocarbon packing induced by pressure.</p><p>The Compressibility of Water in the Lipid Phase: A Thermodynamical Model for Hydration.

In terms of molecular properties, this implies that compressibility data in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref> indeed contain, beyond the lipid contribution, compressibility contributions from water molecules which strongly interact with the lipid polar heads ("bound water", W (B) ) and contributions from water molecules which mainly behave as bulk water ("free water", W (F) ). Therefore, the isothermal phase compressibility, already defined in eq 3, should be written as a linear combination of the partial isothermal compressibilities of three components where χ is the volume fraction of bound water (defined with respect to the total aqueous volume).</p><p>To determine the three compressibility contributions, a simple thermodynamical model for the lipid hydration has been resorted to. In particular, the process of hydration of the DTAC molecule (L) has been described by the equilibrium LW j-1 (B) + W (F) h LW j <ref type="bibr">(B)</ref> , where j, the number of water molecules per lipid that strongly interact with the lipid polar surfaces, varies from 1 to N (by definition, N is then the maximum hydration number). In a simple approximation, the equilibrium constant K (and hence the corresponding Gibbs free energy variation, ∆G) can be assumed to be independent of j where T is the absolute temperature and k B the Boltzmann constant, and the square brackets indicate the molar concentration of the different species. In its turn, ∆G depends on the chemical potentials of the different species. According to eqs 4 and 5, the chemical potentials of the ith species, µ i , can be obtained by a successive integration of eq 5 In this equation, µ°i is the chemical potential of the ith species at the reference pressure p 0 (1 bar, in the present case), and f (p, β°i, η i ) represents the integral function between brackets. Therefore, ∆G can be written as As a unique value of K has been assumed, the reference free energy variation, ∆G°) µ°L W j (B) -µ°L W j-1 (B) -µ°W (F) , does not depend on the hydration number j. Therefore, the pressure dependence of ∆G is only due to the differences between the standard volumes (V°i) and compressibilities (β°i and η i ) of the free and bound water molecules.</p><p>The fraction of lipid molecules directly interacting with j water molecules can be calculated from eq 7 as where C ) n L /VN A is the molar concentration of lipid (N A is Avogadro's number). By imposing the conservation of the total number of water molecules in the system, an implicit function of the bulk water concentration [W <ref type="bibr">(F)</ref> ] ≡ φ W (F) /V W (F) N A can be obtained where M L and M W are the molecular weight of DTAC and water, respectively. 〈j〉 represents the average occupation number (per lipid) of the water sites. The balance in eq 11 can be numerically solved in terms of [W <ref type="bibr">(F)</ref> ]; 〈j〉, R j , φ L and χ can in turn be calculated and the compressibility of the mixture obtained through eq 6.</p><p>The calculation of the coefficients of isothermal partial molecular compressibility is then performed by a global fit of data in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. The fit is based on eq 6 and on both the DTAC and water molecular volumes expressed as a function of pressure. Experimental conditions are labeled by the DTAC weight concentration, c, and the mechanical pressure, p. Fitting parameters are as follows: the reference volume, V°W (B) , and the compressibility parameters of the hydration water, β°W (B) and η W <ref type="bibr">(B)</ref> ; the compressibility parameters of the DTAC, β°L and η L ; the maximum number of hydration sites, N; the reference Gibbs free energy, ∆G°. The reference volumes of bulk water, V°W (F) , and DTAC, V°L, are considered to be known from density data at p ) 0, while the compressibility parameters of bulk water at 20 °C have been set as β°W (F) ) 4.59 × 10 -5 bar -1 and η W (F) ) 5.68 from experimental compressibility data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> The numerical results are reported in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, while the calculated coefficients of isothermal partial molecular compressibility for DTAC and bound water are plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref> as a </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">β ) φ L β L + φ W (B) β W (B) + φ W (F) β W (F) ) φ L β L + (1 -φ L )[χβ W (B) + (1 -χ)β W (F) ] (6) K ) [LW j (B) ] [LW j-1 (B) ][W (F) ] ) e -∆G/k B T (<label>7</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">µ i (p) ) µ°i + V°i { (η i + 1)(η i -1)β°i (p -p 0 ) + 4 log [ 1 2 (η i + 1)β°i p + 1 1 2 (η i + 1)β°i p 0 + 1 ] (η i + 1) 2 β°i } ) µ°i + V°i f (p, β°i, η i ) (8) ∆G ) µ LW j (B) -µ LW j-1 (B) -µ W (F) ) ∆G°+ V°W (B) f(p, β°W (B) , η W (B) ) -V°W (F) f(p, β°W (F) , η W (F) ) (9) R j ) [LW j (B) ] C ) (K [W (F) ]) j 1 -K [W (F) ] 1 -(K [W (F) ]) N+1 (10) 1 -c c M L M W ) 〈j〉 + V L φ L [W (F) ]N A (11) 〈j〉 ) ∑ j)1 N jR j (12) φ L ) cM W V L {1 -[W (F) ]N A (V W (F) -V W (B) )} c(M W V L -M L V W (B) )+M L V W (B) (<label>13</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)</formula><p>F J.

The general behavior described by the previous analysis is confirmed: bound water has a very low compressibility, while the lipid β value strongly depends on pressure. Moreover, a series of information on the hydration properties of DTAC is derived. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref> shows the concentration and pressure dependence of the average hydration number 〈j〉. 〈j〉 increases as a function of the sample water concentration but remains constant below c ) 0.6, suggesting that at this concentration a full hydration condition is achieved. By contrast, 〈j〉 does not vary during compression. Then, DTAC hydration is independent of pressure, and as a consequence, also the R j distribution (i.e., the fraction of lipid molecules directly interacting with j water molecules) should only depend on sample concentration. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>, R j is shown in the form of histograms at four different concentrations: large changes in the distribution of the hydration water are detected in the different experimental conditions. D. Molecular Parameters. As the pressure dependence of the sample volume composition has been established, lipid and aqueous volumes can be calculated at each pressure from unit cell data. Considering the size and shape of the structure elements in the different lipid phases, a series of molecular parameters can be derived as a function of pressure following a well-known procedure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> We should recall here that the structure of the Ia3d cubic phase consists of 24 identical, straight hydrocarbon rods of circular cross section, joined together 3 × 3. The volume (V par ) and the surface area (S par ) of each hydrocarbon rod can be written <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> where l and r are the length (l ) a 8) and radius of the rod, respectively, and k V ) 0.491 and k s ) 0.735 are geometrical constants related to the bevel-shaped ends of the rod. As the volume of each hydrocarbon rod can also be expressed by where V par is the volume of the DTAC hydrocarbon chain (which we assume to feature the same pressure dependence of V L ), the rod radius can be derived by combining eqs 14 and 16. From eq 15, the average area per molecule at the polar/apolar interface (s par ) can be calculated In the hexagonal phase, the radius of the cylinder and the average area available to one molecule at the polar/apolar interface can be determined by using (see Definitions and Abbreviations)</p><p>For the Pm3n micellar cubic phase, a simple geometric approach cannot be used, as the precise shape of the micelles is unknown. However, the volumes of the hydrocarbon micelles in the DTAC system and the S par /V par ratio have been reported by Vargas et al. for a sample at φ L ) 0.52 (a ) 85.4 Å) at ambient pressure: <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> The volumes of the micelles in the a and c positions, measured from electron density maps, were V a,par ) 25.1 × 10 3 Å 3 and V c,par ) 28.6 × 10 3 Å 3 , while it resulted in S a,par ) 0.149V a,par and S c,par ) 0.157V c,par .

However, the shape of the micelles is not described in details; thus, an estimate of the length of the hydrocarbon chain has been obtained by considering micelles of spherical form. The structural parameters calculated using the pressuredependent volume concentrations derived in the previous paragraph are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>. The behavior observed in the three different phases is rather similar: both the average area per molecule at the polar/apolar interface and the hydrocarbon chain length decrease during compression. The variations are nevertheless small and confirm that the conformational changes induced by pressure in the DTAC molecule are surprisingly small, in contrast with the results obtained for inverse lipid phases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Moreover, it should be emphasized that at any pressure the area per molecule is found to increase versus water concentration (i.e., as a function of hydration). In a contrary manner, the area per molecule at constant concentration slightly decreases during compression, indicating that pressure induces some contraction of the polar surfaces.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. Discussion</head><p>Soft-matter macromolecular systems include proteins, biomembranes, surfactant, lipid, and block copolymer mesophases, cellular cytoskeletal networks, and other large-molecule assemblies found in living systems. Molecules in these systems may have a huge number of conformational substates. The free energies of different substates often differ only slightly, even though the 3D molecular structures may differ greatly. Pressures in the range of up to several kilobars alter the ensemble of conformational substates in a macromolecular assembly: since the ensemble of conformational substates under a given set of environmental conditions greatly determines functional activity for many such systems (e.g., proteins, biomembranes), it follows that medium pressure affects biological function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> Thus, medium pressure structural studies are topical and ripe for exploration. In this context, the study of lipid-water dispersions is particularly relevant, as it concerns not only the physical chemistry and the mechanical properties of the assembly, but also the functional characteristics of cell membranes. Under compression, lipids adapt to volume restriction by changing their conformation and packing. Since a delicate balance of competing energetic contributions is involved in stabilization of lipid phases in water, such small changes in conformation can determine large structural transformations and reveal interesting and unusual features.</p><p>For lipid inverse systems, remarkable structural effects have been described (as a negative phase compressibility, a large increase of the lipid hydration level in excess of water, and a series of phase transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> ), and a strong pressure dependence of the basic geometrical shape of the lipid molecules forming type II structures has been reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> Intermediate pressure should affect the structural properties of direct phases in a different way, owing to their different topology. However, only a few studies have been performed on such systems: <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> the main results concerned the phase transition from rodlike micelles to lamellar phases observed in concentrated micellar systems and microemulsions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> In the present case, the high-pressure lyotropic behavior of the DTAC/water system has been considered. DTAC shows an extended direct polymorphism, forming at ambient pressure and as a function of hydration a lamellar, a bicontinuous Ia3d cubic, a hexagonal, and a micellar Pm3n cubic phase (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Compression has been found to induce phase transitions from the hexagonal to the micellar Pm3n cubic phase and from the bicontinuous Ia3d cubic to the hexagonal phase. As expected, the pressure at which transition occurs depends on the lipid concentration (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Under highly dehydrated conditions, the formation of a lamellar phase at high pressure has been observed. A lamellar phase also forms transitorily during the phase transition from the Ia3d cubic to the hexagonal phase. The presence of this phase seems to indicate that changes in local phase concentration occur during the transition. As a consequence, a less hydrated lamellar phase in equilibrium with a more hydrated hexagonal phase forms. According to this hypothesis, after the disappearance of the Ia3d cubic phase, only the hexagonal phase still exists.</p><p>Phase isothermal compressibilities β have been calculated from unit cell dimensions (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). The coefficients of the isothermal compressibility in the three lipid phases are found to be positive: they decrease by increasing the pressure and continuously increase with lipid concentration, even when phase boundaries are crossed. Moreover, β values are systematically lower than those of bulk water (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). Owing to the differences in hydrogen bond network in confined spaces, it is clear that water within the lipid phase exhibits a lower compressibility than in the bulk. The calculated partial molecular values (see the fitted values in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>) confirm that bound water compressibility is unusually low (about 3 to 10 times lower than the compressibility observed in the bulk), while indicating for DTAC a compressibility very dependent on pressure. As lipid compressibility represents a measure of intermolecular interactions, the observed behavior should reflect the tightness of intrinsic hydrocarbon packing induced by pressure, but also accounts for the presence of interstitial volumes resulting from interactions of the solute with the solvent.</p><p>Considering that in the more hydrated conditions only a fraction of water in the aqueous compartment can strongly interact with the lipid surface, a simple thermodynamic model has been formulated to extract from the partial compressibility of water the contribution of the "bound" water as well as the contribution of water molecules which basically behave as "bulk" water. A series of prominent findings, which can be relevant to model the characteristic of the hydration shell in many biological systems, have emerged form this analysis. First, the maximum hydration number N for the DTAC is 12 (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>). Above this limit, excess water inside the lipid phase exhibits the basic properties of bulk water. Second, the ∆G°value (which is related to the work required to hydrate the hydrophilic DTAC surfaces) corresponds to the strength of the stronger hydrogen bonds, which usually lie between 2 and 10 kcal mol -1 . Third, the average hydration number, 〈j〉, shows that hydration is independent of pressure, even at the higher investigated concentrations (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>). Fourth, in full hydration conditions, lipid molecules share an equal number of water molecules, while in less hydrated conditions, a wide distribution of water molecules per lipid is found (see the distribution of the hydration water molecules on the DTAC polar head, R j , shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11</ref>). Indeed, more than 30% of the lipid molecules were unhydrated in the drier samples. This result can be relevant to account for lipid phase diagrams obtained in the less hydrated conditions.</p><p>The molecular parameters of DTAC in the different phases have then been determined as a function of pressure (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">12</ref>). From data, it is evident that intermediate pressures induce only small conformational changes, unlike the large changes observed in lipid molecules forming type II structures. In particular, during compression, both the area per molecule, s par , and the length of the hydrocarbon chain, r, reduce in a tiny but continuous way. However, as the changes of the area per molecule under compression do not correspond to a decrease of the hydration number, it can be suggested that the ordering of water molecules in close vicinity of the smooth polar surfaces also involves the second and/or third hydration layers. This would result in stabilization of the more hydrated structures at high pressures. Accordingly, high-pressure data show that the Pm3n is favored with respect to the H phase at larger hydration, while the H is favored with respect to the Ia3d phase in less hydrated conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, this work shows that a better understanding of the mesomorphism of lipid phases can be reached by analyzing the relationship between the lipid molecular structure and a few thermodynamic parameters when pressure and concentration vary. The present analysis is rather limited, but the reported experimental data could help to put forward different mechanisms and analysis in further theoretical approaches.</p></div>
