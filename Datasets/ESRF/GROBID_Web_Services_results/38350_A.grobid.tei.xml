Reflection intensities were collected along several ZnO and Fe(110) rods. Fig. 1(b) shows for the 3ML sample the measured intensity distribution along the (10L) ZnO-rod (symbols) together with the intensities (line) calculated for the structure model outlined in Fig. (2). High quality fits can be achieved quantified by the Goodness of Fit (GOF) in the 0.9 range, while the unweighted residual is in the 0.2 regime (based on intensities). The 3ML adlayer is characterized by a bulk like ZnO structure, i.e. there is no relaxation of the Wurtzite structure to the h-BN-type structure as observed for ZnO/Ag(111) for the first two layers adjacent to the Ag(111) surface [1]. We have carried out extensive systematic calculations varying all parameters u 1 to u 4 characterizing the structure type (u=0.0 Å and u=0.63 Å corresponding to the h-BN and the bulk Wurtzite structure, respectively). As an example Fig. 3 shows the contour plot of the GOF versus u 1 and u 2 keeping u 3 and u 4 at the optimum values (0.60 and 0.48Å, respectively). The GOF minimum (see cross) is found for u 1 =0.61 Å and u 2 =0.85 Å. Although the first has an error bar in the 0.1-0.2 Å range, values below about 0.5 Å can clearly be ruled out.

Lett. 99, 026102 (2007) [2] Trzhaskovskaya et al. Atomic Data &amp;Nucl. Data Tables 77, 97 (2001) The layer-occupancies were derived to 100%, 100%, 60% and 30% leading to a total coverage of 2.9 atomic layers. This is at some variance with the film thickness of 3.8± ± ± ±0.8Å (≈ ≈ ≈ ≈2 complete layers) derived from high energy photoemission spectroscopy (primary beam energy=14keV) using extrapolated values for the absorption cross sections of Zn and Fe [2]. The analysis of the Fe(110) truncation rods reveals that the surface is covered by a substantial amount (≈ ≈ ≈ ≈0.8-1 ML) of oxygen, consistent with previous photoelectron spectroscopy experiments Fig.2 : Structure model for 3ML ZnO on Fe(110).
