<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Bimetallic alloys or intermetallic compounds on the surface of (La,Sr,Ce)(Me,Ti)O3 formed via topotactic ion-exchange exsolution A wide set of ceramic samples has been synthesized via the Pechini method. The following compositions with single metal have been given: (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9TiO3-δ (LSCT) -reference (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Co0.1Ti0.9O3-δ (Co-doped LSCT) (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Cu0.1Ti0.9O3-δ (Cu-doped LSCT) (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Fe0.1Ti0.9O3-δ (Fe-doped LSCT) (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Ni0.1Ti0.9O3-δ (Ni-doped LSCT) and bimetallic compositions: (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Co0.05Cu0.05Ti0.9O3-δ (Co,Cu-codoped LSCT) (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Co0.05Fe0.05Ti0.9O3-δ (Co,Fe-codoped LSCT) (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Ni0.05Co0.05Ti0.9O3-δ (Ni,Co-codoped LSCT) (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Ni0.05Cu0.05Ti0.9O3-δ (Ni,Cu-codoped LSCT) (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Ni0.05Fe0.05Ti0.9O3-δ (Ni,Fe-codoped LSCT) (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9Fe0.05Cu0.05Ti0.9O3-δ (Fe,Cu-codoped LSCT) Moreover, a set of reference samples was also analysed: NiO, Co3O4, CuO, Cu2O, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, CeO2, Cofoil, Cu-foil, Fe-foil.</p><p>The samples were in a powder form in both as-prepared and reduced state. The reduction of as-preapred powders was performed in home laboratory in hydrogen for 10h at 900C.</p><p>The masurements at LISA beamline were performed in the transmission and fluorescence modes at 80K (cooled down with liquid nitrogen). The proper weight amount of particular powders was mixed with celulose and pressed into pellets before the analysis. The measurements were taken at the near-edge and in the extended range spectra (up to 500 eV above the edge energy). The K-edges of Ce, La and transition metals were colleced, as well as CeL3 edge in few compositions was measured for comparision.</p><p>The examplary figures presenting the obtained results are given below:   The metallic dopants were added to (La0.3Sr0.6Ce0.1)0.9TiO3-δ (LSCT) perovskite structure in order to perform the exsolution process of metallic nanoparticles on the surface of the host material in reducing conditions.</p><p>The K-edge XANES of all analysed samples (Figs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) confirm that a high-temperature reduction in hydrogen shifted the edge position towards lower energies than it was observed for as-prepared samples. It's a consequence of a decreased oxidation state of particular metals. The most significant shift (up to 4 eV) was found for Fe-containing samples. It seems that metals other than iron are in a partially reduced state even in asprepared samples, in order to provide the electroneutrality condition. Thus the edge shift to lower energies after a high-temperature reduction in H2 is not so significant.</p><p>Moreover, the pre-edge behaviour allows to distinguish a reduction efficiency depending on the co-doped metals. For example, if one focuses on the results given for Ni K-edge XANES (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> right), then it is clear that the absorption edge of LSCT doped only with nickel occurs for the highest energy. Co-doping nickel with cobalt decreases this energy, whereas co-doping nickel with copper and iron improves this effect to the highest extent.</p><p>EXAFS was used to study the local geometry of the metallic centres. The FT EXAFS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) of particular compositions confirm that in consequence of the reduction process the local geometry remains oxides with metals at lower oxidation state or even a metallic foil. It indirectly confirms that the exsolution process occurred, leading to the formation of metallic particles on the host material. The effect is even stronger when two properly selected metals are added to the structure (e.g. Ni-Fe or Ni-Cu). Due to the high complexity of the system (at least 6 elements), this EXAFS analysis is rather of qualitative character.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>( email: dacapito@esrf.fr ) Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Beata Bochentyn, Faculty of Applied Physics and Mathematics, Gdańsk University of Technology, 80-233 Gdańsk, ul.
