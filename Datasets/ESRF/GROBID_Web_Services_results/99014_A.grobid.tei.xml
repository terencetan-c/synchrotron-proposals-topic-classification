<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This proposal aimed at investigating the local electronic and atomic structure of CoPt nanoparticles supported on SiO2 under reductive pretreatment and dry reforming of methane (DRM) conditions. Aiming at elucidating structure-performance relationships and deactivation mechanisms of the Co-Pt DRM system we have developed mono-and bimetallic Co and Pt nanoparticles supported on SiO2 (Co/SiO2, Pt/SiO2, CoPt/SiO2) using strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA).<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> This method yields small particle sizes (d(S)TEM &lt;3 nm) that are highly dispersed on the SiO2 support with a metal loading of ca. 1.5-3.8 wt%. Here, we performed in situ XAS-XRD experiments on the prepared catalysts. 2-3 mg of catalyst was placed in a quartz capillary (1.5 mm OD, 0.01 mm wall thickness) between two quartz wool plugs. The capillaries were cut on both sides and glued into a U-shaped steel frame. The frame was mounted on a custom-made cell via 3/16" Swagelok connectors and aligned in such a way that the material was located ~ 5 mm above the center of a hot air blower which allowed heating of the catalyst. A set of mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst) regulated the gas flow (N2, H2, CO2) through the catalyst while a gas chromatograph (compact GC4.0, Global Analyser Solutions, equipped with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors and a time resolution of ca. 7 minutes) analyzed the outgas. All catalysts were treated at 800 °C for 1 h (10 °C min/min) of H2/N2 to monitor the reduction behavior.</p><p>DRM tests were performed at 650 and 750 °C for Co/SiO2 and CoPt/SiO2 after they were pretreated in-situ.</p><p>XAS-XRD data were collected for every metal edge interchangeably during the in-situ/operando experiments.</p><p>In-situ XAS during H2-TPR revealed differences in the reduction behavior (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>). Co2+ species in Co/SiO2 reduce fully to Co 0 after 30 min at 800 °C. Co reduction is accelerated by the addition of Pt for the bimetallic system, likely due to H2 spillover and intimacy of the two metals. 1 Cobalt reduces between 400-500 °C while Pt reduces first below 250 °C in CoPt/SiO2. Small changes in the white line with increasing temperature are attributed to changes in the local structure of cobalt. Figure 2 A shows the XAS data of Co/SiO2 at Co K-edge together with the Co foil and differences are attributed to the difference in particle size and crystal structure (fcc or hcp). The CoPt/SiO2 shows an increased white line intensity compared to the monometallic Co/SiO2 and Co. This increased intensity has been previously related to the alloying of Co with Pt leading to a charge transfer from Co to Pt and it could be the reason for the enhanced performance of the bimetallic catalyst. 2 Figure 2 B depicts the Fourier-transformed EXAFS of Pt/SiO2 and CoPt/SiO2 showing differences in radial distances and magnitudes proving the incorporation of Co into the Pt lattice. XRD (Figure 2 C) of Co/SiO2 shows the formation of Co nanoparticles with an fcc structure of dXRD = 3 nm after reduction; Pt/SiO2 shows a broad pattern indicating nanoparticles of dXRD &lt; 2 nm. The CoPt/SiO2 shows a shift towards larger angles due to incorporation of Co in Pt confirming the successful alloying. Finally, the operando XAS-XRD deactivation experiments of CoPt/SiO2 showed a small increase in the white line intensity and shift of the main (111) peak towards lower angles under time on stream, which might be associated with a partial oxidation and/or dealloying, respectively. Therefore, we hypothesize that the DRM has led to a partial segregation of the CoPt alloy: on the one hand, XANES and EXAFS suggest that a great fraction of the alloy, mainly in the core, must still exist; on the other hand, the oxidation of Co in the CoPt alloy might have led to either an Ptricher alloy or isolated Pt islands/clusters on the surface due to dealloying. 2 Blanc, N. et al., Phys. Rev. B 2013, 87 (15).</figDesc></figure>
