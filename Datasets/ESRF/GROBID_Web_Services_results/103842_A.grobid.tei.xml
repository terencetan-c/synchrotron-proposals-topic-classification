<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: These experiments were the first to attempt RIXS of a transuranium system. The sample of 11 g of Am in the compound AmFe2 was prepared at ITU, Karlsruhe. The same sample had been used previously on the ID12 beamline to investigate the ground state of the material <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The present experiments were conducted at the M5 and M4 edges of Am (3.887 and 4.095 keV, respectfully) and aimed to study the higher-energy states of this material. Because of the safety containment, which included ~ 60 m of Kapton windows, this experiment could not be conducted at the ID32 beamline, where the resolution is &lt; 0.1 eV, but instead ID26 was used with the resolution of 0.55 and 0.73 eV at the respective M edges listed above. The experiment was a considerable success. Clear spectra have been observed, and agree qualitatively with theory by Martin Sundermann at U. of Cologne. Am 3+ has a J = 0 ground state [1] and the j = 5/2 substate is almost full so that the inelastic spectra at zero energy transfer at the M4 edge is weak, and this is clearly observed. The first inelastic peak at the M5 is at &lt; 1 eV and merged with the inelastic response at E = 0, which is presently not understood.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detailed modeling is now underway.</head><p>What is clear from this experiment is that the excited 5f states can be observed clearly, despite the presence of conduction electrons, as this material is a metal. Previously, work at the N edges has had difficulty observing spectra from systems with conduction electrons <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Attempts were also made at other edges, including the K edge of Fe, but no signal was observed.</p><p>[1] N. <ref type="bibr">Magnani et al., Phys.
