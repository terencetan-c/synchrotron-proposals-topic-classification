<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental Summary STAM2 and Tri-ubiquitin are flexible multidomain proteins and their interactions are known to play a key role in the regulation of their target proteins during endocytosis. We have obtained our SAXS measurements in June 2017. During the course of our beamtime we have managed to measure different protein constructs and complexes (STAM2 UIM-SH3 &amp; VHS-UIM-SH3; Tri-Ubiquitin; Tri-Ubiquitin:STAM2 complexes at different molar ratios; Mono-ubiquitin &amp; mono-ubiquitin:STAM2 controls; AMSH &amp; STAM2:ubiquitin:AMSH di/trimeric complexes, etc.) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) at various concentration ranges. 82 samples were measured in total. In terms of sample quality, STAM2, Tri-Ubiquitin (Ub3) and their dimeric complexes at various molar ratios showed curves with good signal / noise within the q range between 0.007 and 0.490 Å -1 at concentrations ranging between 0.75 and 8 mg / ml. Strong interparticle efects were not evident. In the case where there was a slight concentration-dependent interparticle effect, the final scattering curve was obtained by merging the curves from the lower (for the low angle) and the higher (for the higher angle data) concentrations which was then used for further analysis. STAM2 and Ub3 data analyses, modeling and interpretation focus primarily on the flexible nature of the proteins using a combination of methods including monte-carlo conformational sampling, Crysol, EOM and MultiFoXS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). STAM2:Ub3 complex data were analysed and quasi-atomic models are being proposed through optimisation of the rigidbody docking using methods such as FoXS Dock and pyDockSAXS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Given the interesting preliminary results of the complex SAXS data, it awaits further experimental proofs and computational refinements from RDC, MD, SEC-SAXS, etc. On the other hand, albeit our continued effors to ensure monodispersity and homogeneity for all our samples, AMSH was severely aggregated due to its inherent instability even at a concentration as low as 0.1 mg / ml. Mono-Ubiquitin requires further adjustment in its sample quality which will be incorporated in our next available beamtime.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Results &amp; upcoming plans</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the processed SAXS curves for tri-ubiquitin (Ub3) in blue, VHS-UIM-SH3 (VUS) in purple and Ub3:VUS complex at 1:1 molar ratio in red, which were fit against each of the theoretical scattering curves represented as solid lines. Taking the flexible nature of STAM2 and Ub3 into account, EOM &amp; MultiFoXS were used in parallel to obtain the best ensemble structures from which the average theoretical curves were calculated. R G distribution of both proteins indicates a presence of multiple states (2 and 3 for Ub3 and VUS respectively) with the strong tendancy towards more extended conformations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Overall, the quality of our experimental SAXS data, linearity of the Guinier plot, and model fiting by c 2 minimisation were of good standard as summerised in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. As we progress into the later phase of this project, we are further exploring the flexibility or 'unstructuredness' of STAM2. A series of truncated mutants of STAM2 have been designed, engineered, over-expressed and purified in line with our next beamtime details of which will be described in the next proposal. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
