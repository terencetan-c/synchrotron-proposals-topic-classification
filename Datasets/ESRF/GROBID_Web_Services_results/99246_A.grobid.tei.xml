<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The finished experiment aimed to use diffraction data for strain tomography technique that provide 2D planar distribution of residual strains. The experiment was completed successfully and the collected diffraction data has been used for mapping planar distribution of residual strains form 5 planes that are called as top, top middle, middle, bottom middle and bottom. This arrangement of planes cover the whole volume of 30 mm tower shaped sample with a step size of 7.5 mm. An example illustration of distribution of calculated residual strains is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The high quality of experimental data allowed allowed determination of boundaries of rectangular body accurately and distributon of residual strain show tensile strains in the central parts as it is expected.</p><p>The result of strain tomography calculations are being used for eigenstrain reconstruction residual strains in the whole volume that include planes that were not scanned for maping strain distribution. Currently, the eigenstrain model has been modified for 3D eigenstrain reconstruction and a very good match between strains calculated by strain tomography technique and reconstructed by eigenstrain reconstruction is achieved.</p><p>The reliability of 3D eigenstrain model has been analysed using numerical experiments. The results of these tests will be presented with strain tomography calculations and the recostruction of residual strains in the rectangular additively manufactured specimen. This novel approach that aims the non-destructive and 3D reconstruction of residual strains is planned to be published in high impact journals. The corresponding manuscript is being prepared. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): UZUN Fatih, The University of Oxford LIOGAS Kostas, The University of Oxford WANG Zifan, The University of Oxford BESNARD Cyril, The University of Oxford</figDesc></figure>
