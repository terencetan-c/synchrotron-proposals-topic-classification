<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The Experiment The speciation and transformation of mercury-sulfur systems is important in the understanding of the transport and toxicity of mercury in the environment. This is of particular relevance to the bio-availability of mercury and to land clean-up technologies in contaminated areas. We had previously investigated the speciation of concentrated Hg in sulfidic solutions at high pH at S.R.S. Station 16.5. As the pH is lowered the solubility of Hg is lowered considerably, thus the high intensity of the ESRF ID26 was required for these more dilute solutions. The solutions were made up from synthetic metacinnabar (HgS), sodium sulfide and a pH buffer (pH 9.18) in an anaerobic environment, at CLRC Daresbury. They were kept under nitrogen and loaded into the 'Lennie<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> ' cell for the XAFS experiment in a glove bag under nitrogen. All samples were filtered through a 0.02 micron filter prior to loading. Either PEEK or BN windows were used with Kalrez o-rings. Stibnite was added to one solution as G. R. Helz (Pers. Comm) has suggested the formation of Hg-S-Sb complexes in solution. Spectra were measured in k-space mode, counting for either 1 or 2 seconds per point. For the most concentrated samples as few as 4 spectra (270 ppm Hg) were summed to give high quality data. For the most dilute sample (4 ppm Hg) 24 spectra were summed. Spectra were added in EXODUS, background subtracted in EXBROOK and simulated using EXCURV98. Some precipitation occurred as the solutions were heated. The solid tended to accumulate on the cell window thus the EXAFS spectra. We were able to collect good data on 4ppm solution in several hours, but on dilution to 0.4 ppm EXAFS proved impossible to collect. After 12 hours collection of what appeared to be on the screen a reasonable spectrum, the 24 scans were summed but there was no real EXAFS, just the influence of oscillations coming through from I0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Results</head><p>The Figure shows the fit for the 4ppm data at room temperature as a gauge of data quality. All the solution data could be modelled by Hg with 2 S atoms at ca. 2.30 Å in a linear geometry, the fits were improved significantly by multiple scattering. This bond distance of 2.30Å in the Hg-S complexes is similar to that found in higher concentration samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Lennie et. al, 2002)</ref> and is typical of two coordinate Hg, and is similar to that that found in cinnabar (HgS -the main Hg ore), which has Hg-S distances of 2.368Å in -S-Hg-S-Hg-infinite chains running through the structure. These small coordination numbers are considered to be a consequence of relativistic effects In contrast to previous work, there is evidence of further shells suggesting dimers or larger clusters and these clusters occur in the solutions with the lowest sulfide concentration at room temperature. On heating the second shell is lost, either due to an increase in thermal vibrations that may remove evidence for the second shell or the cluster may break up. In the 4 ppm Hg sample with 0.03M Na 2 S, 4 Hg atoms are at 6.23 Å while in the 37 ppm Hg sample in 0.005M Na 2 S 4 Hg atoms are at 4.5 Å. The solid formed in high temperature solutions is similar in structure to amorphous meta-cinnabar that we have seen previously studies of HgS precipitates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Barnes (1979)</ref>, HgS 2 2-is dominant in the region above pH = 8 and a Raman spectroscopy investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cooney and Hall, 1966)</ref> suggest linear complexes form. One consistency of these previous studies is the proposed presence of an HgS 2 2-species at high pH. The data we in this study are consistent with the formation of [S-Hg-S] 2-species with Hg-S bond lengths of 2.3 Å. The identification of polynuclear Hg-S species is the first direct evidence of their presence in sulfidic solutions. The possibility that amorphous metcinnabar is present is discounted because then Hg would be 4coordinate with Hg-S ca 2.54 Å and 12 Hg at 4.15 Å (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Lennie et al., 2002)</ref>, and polysulfides (common in Hg-S systems) would involve both 4 coordinate Hg and high S:Hg ratios. Polymeric metal species have been predicted in other metal-sulfide systems but theoretical and experimental studies studies (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Tossell, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">2001, Barnes and</ref><ref type="bibr">Seward , 1997)</ref> all focus on monomeric Hg-S complexes. The data presented here require a re-examination of this assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>This study provides ample evidence of the value of high fluxes an high quality detectors in the study of environmentally relevant systems. These data both provide the confirmation of previous work by providing direct evidence of linear Hg-S solutions species and evidence of polynuclear Hg-S species. We believe with even better detectors we could achieve data on the 0.4ppm solution and provide confirmation of the existence of polynuclear species and produce data directly relevant to environmental systems</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="2,328.00,394.00,209.00,367.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
