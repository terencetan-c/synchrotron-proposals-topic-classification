<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Within the allocated beamtime, we conducted high-presssure (P) and -temperature (T) in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments on Fe-Si-(Ni) alloys in an internally-heated diamond anvil cell (DAC) at ID27. The principal research goal is to place constraints on the P-T location of the boundary between the face-centred cubic (FCC) structure and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure in . We already had several data in our previous beamtime .</p><p>In-situ XRD experiments were performed at ID27 with a monochromatic wavelength of 0.3738Å. The sample temperature was measured by the spectroradiometric system availiable on the beamline and the pressure was obtained from the unit-cell volume of the HCP phase and its thermal equation of state. We prepared 4 cells for Fe-4Si in advance at different pressures. During compression one cell broke diamond anvils.</p><p>First we increased the pressure at room temperature. At a constant load, the temperature was then increased by directly appling a DC current across the metallic sample (thermally insulated from the diamods). The first cell was compressed to 24 GPa and then heated up. At 1233 K we obseved appearance of FCC peaks and confirmed disappearance of all the peaks of the HCP phase at 1327 K. Experiments on the second cell at 41 GPa also confirmed coexistence of the FCC and HCP phases at 1744 and 1940 K. In the third cell which were from 123 GPa at 300 K to 157 GPa ar 4400 K, we only observed HCP phase.</p><p>All the experimental data obtained in this beamtime are consistent with our own existing data in the previous beamtime, and we feel that we have obtained enough data to publish a paper.</p></div>			</div>
