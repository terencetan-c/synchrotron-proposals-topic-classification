<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the experiment HC-3977, we successfully performed the first in situ high-pressure XPCS experiments on a Ce-based metallic glass up to ~10 GPa using a diamond anvil cell at the beamline ID10. The XPCS data were collected at principle peak position (qp) at given pressure points after the pressure was stabilized before the measurement. The time evolution of the microscopic dynamics during high pressure aging is captured in XPCS at qp by the intensity two-time correlation function (TTCF), shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. At each pressure the relaxation time is stable in the whole time scale, indicating the stationary dynamics were measured at the given pressure. To get quantitative information of the relaxation process, the time average intensity autocorrelation functions, 𝑔 2 (𝑞, 𝑡) are calculated, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, by averaging each TTCF along the tw axis. In order to get the relaxation time and shape parameters, we use a modulated Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) model function: 𝑔 2 (𝑞, 𝑡) = 1 + 𝑎 + 𝑐[exp (-2(𝑡/𝜏) 𝛽 )] to fit the 𝑔 2 (𝑞, 𝑡) functions. Surprisingly, the relaxation time τ does not change monotonically with pressure, but it peaks at ~3 GPa, and then starts to decrease. The Ce-based MG has pressure-induced polyamorphic transition from low-density amorphous to high-density amorphous states. Interestingly, the pressure range where the τ changes anomalously well matches the polyamorphic transition zone in this MG detected by in situ high-pressure XRD measurements, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. Our results reveal that microscopic dynamics may be highly susceptible to local atomic structures tuned by pressure. However, due to the limited beamtime and lack of sufficient experience for the first high pressure XPCS experiment both for us and the beamline scientists, we did not have chance to measure the reversibility/irreversibility of the behavior during decompression. Also, the pressure range is quite limited to have a clearer trend of the high pressure behavior. To address the mechanism behind, we need more tests on the same sample and also some other compositions to clarify the role of pure density change and electronic and atomic structure modification induced by pressure. Nevertheless, the present obtained results of the first high pressure XPCS experiment on metallic glasses are very interesting and the manuscript is under preparing.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
