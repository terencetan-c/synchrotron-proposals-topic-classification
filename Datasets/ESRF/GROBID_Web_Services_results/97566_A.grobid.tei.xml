<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>3 ) 2 , analogue of mineral buetschliite, important constituent of the carbonate inclusions in deep minerals [Giuliani et al. 2012]. The trigonal-to-monoclinic phase transition at about 6.5 GPa is rather smooth in terms of the bulk compressibility (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>); however the K structure polyhedron exhibits not only an abrupt increase of the distortion index, but also the volume expansion (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>), which seems quite unusual. In the nearest future we intend to submit a paper on the highpressure behaviour of K 2 Ca(CO 3 ) 2 to the journal "Physics and Chemistry of Minerals".</p></div>
