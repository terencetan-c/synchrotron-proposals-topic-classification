<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Bacterial cellulose, or nanocellulose, is an important matrix component in the biofilms of many free-living and clinically important bacterial species. E. coli and many other band g-proteobacteria share conserved multi-component bcs operons for cellulose secretion, where the encoded subunits are proposed to assemble in sophisticated secretory nanomachines. We recently reported a low-resolution structure of a multicomponent Bcs macrocomplex encompassing most of the inner-membrane and cytosolic components (Krasteva et al., Nature Communications 2017 (1)) and are currently aiming to obtain high-resolution cryo-EM data on the same sample. We collected a first dataset on the CM01 at the ESRF in January 2019. The purified Bcs macrocomplex was flash frozen on Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3 grids and the freezing conditions were optimized by initial screening on a Talos Arctica microscope at the IECB Bordeaux. The optimal freezing conditions were reproduced for data collection on the CM01 and a total of 4093 movies were collected in electron counting mode using an energy filter. We collected 3 movies per grid hole using a nominal magnification of 130 000 x, a pixel size of 1.05248 A 2 , and a range of defocus values between 0.8 and 2.8 microns as set in EPU. The data was pre-processed using MotionCorr 2 and Gctf for motion correction and CTF estimation, respectively. Overall the data was of good quality, with an average resolution per micrograph at about 3.1A, going as high as 2.3A and with only a fraction of micrographs having an estimated resolution of about 4A. We obtained a preliminary structure reconstruction with an overall resolution of about 4A, pending particle polishing, movie and multi-body refinement. Nevertheless, the particles and resultant 3D reconstruction were characterized by significant gradient of estimated local resolution, with very limited resolution for the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the macrocomplex (likely due to the presence of a detergent micelle, partial complex dissociation and/or conformational flexibility or variability). As we could only select between 30-50 good particles per frame, the total dataset was relatively small in particle count and 3D classification did not yield enriched enough classes to increase the local resolution for these regions. We will therefore aim to increase the overall particle count by collecting an additional dataset at the same microscope settings in order to be able to merge the data and reliably reclassify and refine the 3D structure reconstruction(s).</p></div>		</body>
