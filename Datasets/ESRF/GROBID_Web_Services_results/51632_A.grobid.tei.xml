<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to investigate the early steps of amyloid beta (A) aggregation in situ using microfluidic devices. A is known to play an important role in Alzheimer's disease and it is currently debated whether the large, fibrillar aggregates are the cause for brain damage or smaller souble oligomers. In particular, not much is kown about the early assembly steps of this peptide. Microfluidic laminar flow mixers provide the possibility to study these first assembly steps, on a time scale of milliseconds to minutes. We employed specifically designed microfluidic devices (shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) that are X-ray compatble with Kapton as the window material. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> shows a close up microscopy image (taken with the beamline microscope) of the device with the flow directions depicted by arrows. The microfluidic devices ensure laminar flow and allow us to access different time points in the aggregation process. X-Ray experiments were performed in transmission geometry with a microfocused beam (5 x 5 µm², EH 2 of ID13). A visible light microscope (calibrated to the focus of the X-ray beam, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) was used to position the sample in the beam. During the beamtime, we experienced a very stable and well-aligned setup. Full length A peptides (1-42) as well as a shorter mutant (4-42) were investigated. A stable laminar flow was established, as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> (green arrow). The peptides were injected into the device in monomeric form. Upon addition of an aggregation buffer from the side inlets and diffusive mixing in the channels, we expect the onset of aggregation. Flow rates were adjusted so as to obtain a stable jet. The narrower (as determined by the flow rate ratio of main inlet and side inlets; the sheath inlets serve the only purpose of keeping the system from premature aggregation and the channels from clogging) the central peptide stream is, the faster the mixing occurs due to shorter diffusive path lengths . The underlying principle is that the peptide molecules, which are comparably large, diffuse only very slowly out of the central stream while the smaller solutes (salt ions, hydronium, hydroxite) in the buffers diffuse much faster. We can therefore bring the peptide from the initial buffer into a different buffer which leads to a change in pH or ionic strength and thereby initiates aggregation. Despite the optically visible stable stream of peptide in the device (green arrow, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), the scattering signal from the biological system is hardly detectable. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, we show a dark field composite image of the central region of the device. For this dark field image, the device area has been scanned through the X-ray beam in 20-µm-steps. The jet can hardly be detected as the signal is too weak. Our conclusion from this experiment is that the time scales for A aggregation are too long to be detected in our current setup. This is probably due to the fact, that the full length peptide (and even the slightly shorter mutant) needs a comparably long time to rearrange all involved amino acids. Our future experiments will therefore focus on the short FF (di(phenylalanin)) motive which is thought to be responsible for A aggregation and due to its short length assembles much faster and in a more controlled way.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. a) Setup at the ID13 beamline (EH2, microbeam).
