<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction (SC-XRD) uses tabulated dispersion values to account for inelastic interactions between incident photons and the electrons of atoms in a crystal structure, which reduce the scattered radiation intensity observed in the diffraction pattern. These dispersion values correct the atomic form factors f n = f 0,n + f ′ + if ′′ with f n being the atom's corrected form factor, f 0,n being the classical form factor, f ′ and f ′′ being the real and imaginary part of the correction. Tabulated values from different sources are always pre-calculated for neutral, isolated atoms and remained unchanged for decades. Therefore, those dispersion values are not well-suited for chemical compounds and their unique electronic environments. For instance, different formal oxidation states of a given element lead to a significant shift of the absorption edge itself and influence the pattern after the edge. This effects are well known and used in methods such as X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) or extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). With these considerations in mind, our goal was to obtain information on the chemical and electronic environment of a compound by collecting SC-XRD data and refining its dispersion values at the heaviest atom's absorption edge. For this purpose, we collected XANES data of the compound Mo(CO) 6 and compared the data to an absorption spectrum of metallic Molybdenum to specify the actual edge of absorption. We then carried out seven SC-XRD experiments at different energies based on the determined absorption edge on the Mo(CO) 6 compound and compared our refined dispersion values to the ones being tabulated by Sasaki (KEK Report 1989, 88, 1) and Henke (Atom. Data Nucl. Data Tabl. 1993, 54, 181).</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> a even 100 eV below the absorption edge of Molybdenum (20,000 eV) the f' value according to Henke differs significantly from both our refined and the tabulated Sasaki value.</p><p>The biggest difference was observed at 20,000 eV: At this point both tables assume, that the absorption edge has already been passed, because they are based on elemental Molybdenum. In spite of the identical formal oxidation state Mo(0), Mo(CO) 6 is electronically different compared to the pure element. It reveals the absorption edge of Molybdenum to be shifted to 20,013 eV, which was approved by XANES measurements of both, Molybdenum foil and the Mo(CO) 6 crystal. Most noticeably, the refined dispersion value peaks only at 20,013 eV, whereas both tabulated dispersion values are already decreasing at this energy. To validate these findings, we also compared the resulting R 1 values for the respective models in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> b. It was found to be constantly low for our refined dispersion values, indicating a consistently good agreement of our modelled and measured data. In contrast, the R 1 values for the tabulated dispersion values deviate significantly in the energy range around the absorption edge of Molybdenum. This suggests, that the assumed dispersion values used in X-ray Crystallography have to be individually revised for experiments with elements near an absorption edge. Additionally, a correlation between refined dispersion values and the shift of an absorption edge may be used to draw conclusions on the electronic and chemical environment of an element of interest or even allow to derive its formal oxidation state from SC-XRD experiments. In our investigations we could demonstrate that the dispersion corrections f ′ and f ′′ can be refined for measurements near Molydenums's absorption edge and that this procedure benefits the quality of the structure model. Furthermore, we observed that the dispersion values are heavily influenced by both -the shift of the edge of absorption and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure. Further studies of this kind also heavily rely on synchrotron radiation for simultaneous SC-XRD and XANES/EXAFS measurements.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="2,65.62,105.07,457.85,210.12" type="bitmap" /></figure>
