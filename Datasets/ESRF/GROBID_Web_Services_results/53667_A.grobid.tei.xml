<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>There is a drive towards using "greener" solvents for industrial processes. Water and simple aliphatic alcohols are considered good candidates for replacing less environmentally friendly solvents, however, the</p><p>The aim of the experiment was to examine the changes along a catalyst bed (Pd/Al 2 O 3 ) in a plug flow reactor.</p><p>The spatial resolution allows an understanding of how solvents change the nature of the catalyst bed, what these changes are and where in the bed the changes take place.</p><p>In particular we were interested in: 1. the effect of changing the solvent passed through the catalyst (different organic solvents or different proportions of organic solvent and water) 2. the effect of changing the size of the nanoparticles in the catalyst (through different catalyst loadings) effects of such solvents upon catalysts is poorly understood. This work aims to identify what changes occur in the catalyst due to solvents and if they are uniform.</p><p>Our custom built sample environment was mounted on the beamline sample stages. Spectra (EXAFS) were recorded at the Pd K-edge in transmission mode with simultaneous recording of a Pd foil standard. A spot size of 3 mm × 0.35 mm (w × h) was employed to allow interrogation of the spatial resolution of the catalyst bed. A macro was used to record sequential spectra scanning up and down the catalyst bed over approx. two hours (typical experiment) although some measurements of longer duration were also made. The in situ Raman facilities were also employed, but the required acquisition time was too long for useful in operando measurements to be made on our samples. However, some off-line measurements were made to obtain endpoint spectra.</p><p>The number of experiments and the volume of data collected will take time to fully process. We are looking at analysis of both XANES (edge jump &amp; linear combination fitting, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and EXAFS (co-ordination number, Pd-Pd interatomic distance and Debye-Waller factor). Main observations:</p><p>(i) Solvent effects: Reduction occurs only with 1º and 2º alcohols. Addition of water changes the rate and end point of the reduction. (ii) Particle size:</p><p>Larger nanoparticles reduce more quickly and to a greater degree than small particles. In addition, where metallic Pd phases are produced the first-shell Pd-Pd bond distances are unusually large given the dimensions of the Pd nanoparticles. This strongly suggests that atomic hydrogen is being stored within the reduced particles. The degree of hydrogen storage depends on the Pd loading and the Pd precursor used to make the catalysts. (iii) Catalyst preparation:</p><p>The precursor used in the preparation of the catalyst may also have a profound effect on the reduction of the Pd-np. Pd catalysts derived from Cl containing precursors are reduced at significantly faster rates than those that are Cl free This is currently attributed to the presence of chloride anions -further experiments have been planned to verify this hypothesis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1b</head><p>Linear combination fitting of XANES. (5% Pd/Al 2 O 3 , 50:50 EtOH, H 2 O, 1 ºC/min to 80 ºC) Each of our experiments run at the beamline (typically 400 spectra) produced a single output file which could not be read by any standard analysis software. Although a stand alone program has been written on the beam line to convert the output files from the beamline to a more standard format, this program is not transferable to other computers (a copy was made, but does not run on computers at our institutions). The need to run this program on all output files before they can be read by any standard analysis software is a major problem.</p><p>Due to time pressures, we did not convert data from two experiments using this program. The data from these two is therefore currently unusable to us. Further, the format of the "split up" files generated by this stand alone program is not readable by the software required for batch EXAFS data analysis. The manual editing of files such that they can be read into software for the batch EXAFS analysis is not practical due to the large number of spectra which our experiments generate.</p><p>We have contacted Dr Emmerich regarding how to resolve this problem. He has communicated that he can write an executable file which will process the data to give a data format suitable to reading into our software. However, at the time of writing this report we are still waiting to receive this and remained blocked in terms of a deeper analysis of the large amount of high quality data that our visit to BM01 resulted in.</p><p>We hope that this can be sorted out in short order in 2015 such that we might make best use of the excellent data the beamline has provided us with and publish accordingly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Dr John B Brazier* Dr King Kuok (Mimi) Hii Dr Mark A Newton*</figDesc></figure>
