<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Cryo-electron micrographs of incrementally heated Flock House Virus (FHV) particles collected at ESRF (Experiment # MX-2025) were utilized to generate an asymmetric reconstruction to a resolution of 4.7 Å (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, A and C) using RELION 2.1. The reconstruction represents the eluted particle, a disassembly intermediate of FHV. The asymmetric reconstruction has revealed several essential global as well as local conformation alterations that occur during non-enveloped virus disassembly, including loss of membrane penetrating peptides from the capsid, and opening of a pore at the 2-fold axis on one side of the capsid. The cryomicrographs also contained a small fraction (~2%) of puffed particles, another FHV disassembly intermediate representing a more advanced stage of uncoating and characterized by a prominent surface protrusion (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). These particles were manually picked from the cryomicrographs and processed to obtain a 3D reconstruction at 26.2 Å resolution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>). The puffed particle represents a unique disassembly intermediate, captured during genome release. We aim to achieve a high resolution, asymmetric micrograph of frozen hydrated wildtype FHV particles heated to 70 °C. Red arrows point to the particles with considerably less dense centres.

(C) Surface rendered, radially colored cryo-EM density map of reconstructed eluted particle (C) and puffed particle (D), in different orientations with the color key (right) displaying radial distance (in Å) from particle centre.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Asymmetric cryo-EM reconstruction of intermediate eluted and puffed particles.
