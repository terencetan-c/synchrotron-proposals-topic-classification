<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Poly(alky)thiophenes are examples of coloured organic materials that owe their semiconductive <ref type="bibr">(and optical)</ref> properties to the fact that they have altermating single and double bonds along the chain ('conjugated' polymers, or 'conducting polymers' when doped). Optical absorption spectra obtained on thin, spin-cast layers on glass substrates, show a band gap at about 2.0 eV, giving the materials their red colour. This gap increases as temperature is raised to more than 130'C, leading to a corresponding Change of colour to yellow ('thermochronism'). Diffraction studies on hulk materials show that they are partially crystalline at ambient temperatures, and that the crystal peaks disappear at temperatures where the colour changes take place, indication a 'melting' transition. Preliminary studies using synchrotrons X-rays at grazing incidence <ref type="bibr">[ 1 ]</ref> showed that poly(hexyl)thiophene (PHT) and poly(octyl)thiophene (POT) are partial crystalline also as thin submicron spin-cast layers, and the absence of reflection of the type 010 was tentatively interpreted as a possible indication of a strong orientation effect by the substrate. This point, as well as the temperature behaviour was the subject of the present investigation using BL. D5.</p><p>As it turned out BL D5, equipped with the sagittally focussing monochromator, is marginally just of sufficient intensity for this kind of experiments, when the polymer layers are not [00 thin. A vertical beam height of 0.2 mm and an angle of vertical incidence of 0.2째 were used. D5 is equipped with a scintilation detector with slit collimation, able to be scanned only in the horizontal plane. An option to scan vertically ought to be made available. Two samples of POT different thicknesses were studied (estimated thickness ratio Of five). These scans revealed that for the ihick sample, both h(?(? (100, 2~() and 3(M ) &amp; oi(l were observed, whereas for a thin sample the oj (1 was not seen, confirming the preliminary results <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Diffuse scattering is also seen. See Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. For a convincing proof of preferred orientation, however, also detection in the vertical direction is needed. We were lucky to be able to apply a ('("D-camera, kindly made available at the Detector (Group, and is is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> this provided the ultimate evidence: Whereas for the thick layer sample the i 00 = reflection is disributed evenly in all directions, the thin layer is not only of a preferred orientation; its a-axis is confined to the substrate surface to within 1 -2째 ! ( The direct beam hits at the lower left corner of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The much weaker 010 -reelection was not discernable from the CCD-camera exposure. But the fact it was absent in the (horizontal) scintillation detector scan tells us that for thin layers the polymer strands a-c o.rknm! with boll: dwir m~7in chain &lt;c -axis) and ?Acir ocnd side chins ('a -a-is) ,f~al on ihc jubsrrarc s::rfticv.</p><p>This ilnding is of great importance to understand the optical properties of deposited thin layers of polythiophenes. it remains to investigate the role of various substrate materials, for instance single crystal surfaces. This strong orientational effect by the substrate of the poly(octylthiophene) sample could be confronted with an opposite effect found for poly(dioctyl-bithiophene) (PDOT 2 ). Whereas the former has its octy] side chains attached to the main chain in essentiality the same manner-along the polymer, the latter has an alternating attachment on the right or the Ieft corner of the thiophene monomers ('head-to-head' versus 'head-to-tail' and tail-to-head' configurations). Unlike POT, PDOT 2 is yellow -at all temperatures, and Sh0WS no thermochromic 'behaviour <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The diffraction pattern that was observed from the thin layer of PDt3T2 show-cd the presence of both 10() and Oi' O --reflections.</p><p>Temperature studies were performed on the two types of POT deposites. "-The glass slides were placed horizontally on top of a 25 watt heat plate, and the temperature was measured in a slit cut into the edge of the s]ides. Care had to be excerted against radiation damages when the temperature was raised.</p><p>The beaviour of both films were grossly the same as that of bulk POT : the crystallinity disappeared at . . about 130째C, which coincides with the temperature of the colour change. For the thin layer sample the L)I () -region was monitored both during heating and cooling. No indication was found that the substrate anchoring was affected during heating, before the 'melting' takes place. On the other hand the preferred orientation is not reestablished upon retooling, as clearly seen by the pressence of the 010reflection after a heating cycle to above 130째C. This finding indicates strongly that the orientational effect is not of a thermodynamic, but rather of a kinematic oirigin, probably being related to the rapidity of the removal of the solvent during the spin casting process. This conclusion corroborates well with the finding that the thin layers are affected by the substrate, but the thick ones not.</p><p>.. .</p></div>		</body>
