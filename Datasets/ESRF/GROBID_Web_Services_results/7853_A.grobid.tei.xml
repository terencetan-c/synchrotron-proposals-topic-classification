<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report :</head><p>Advances in solid material synthesis and new possibilities offered by microtechnologies have contributed widely to the development of devices for detecting polluting gases in air, particularly reducing gases such as carbon monoxide and methane.</p><p>By submicronic aerosol pyrolysis (Pyrosol process) our group is able to synthesize thin films ,of doped tin oxide on oxidized silicon substrates (Si02 thickness : = 1 micron, Sn02 thickness = 1 micron, sample area = 15x10 mm2). A very fine and homogeneous dispersion of metallic aggregates (3-5 nm) within the film is obtained by co-deposition of the two species (tin oxide and metal). This method provides metallic particles whose size increases with the amount of metal in the codeposition. In the case of 6% Pt doped tin oxide thin films, this particular structure leads to electrical transport properties highly sensitive to carbon monoxide just above 100°C (fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>The interaction phenomena between CO and the composite [Sn02 + Pt or Pd (or PdO) clusters] are not completely understood. They are potentially described by a simple model where the adsorption of reducing species leads to a modification of local environment of the metallic element and of its oxidation state as well. This is associated with an electronic charge transfert between the clusters and the Sn02 support however. This model nevertheless needs to be verified and refined to allow accurate manipulation of the sensitivities to various gases and temperatures.</p><p>As EXAFS is the only technique which allows the detection and analysis of the surroundings of metallic elements under controlled atmosphere we have used X-ray absorption to study the local environment and the oxidation state (XANES) of the metallic elements added into the films. To confirm that the method could be used we decided to analyse at first a favourable case : films with platinum as metallic additive. An EXAFSin-situ experiment has been carried out as the material (Sn02 films with various amounts of Pt particles -12%, 6%, 3% -deposited on an oxidised 2x2cm2 silicon substrate) was inserted in a specific reaction cell, heated to maximum temperatures of 400°C and put in contact with air or with a polluting gaseous mixture containing small amounts of reducing gas (Air + 300ppm CO, N2 + 900ppm CO). The thickness of the films was in the range of a few pm. The X-ray absorption has been measured in fluorescence mode within an energy range close to Pt LIII edge. As the experiment has been performed in December 1997, the data processing has not been fully completed but a substantial amount of results has already been obtained :</p><p>The evolution of the white line shows that the platinum particles exhibit two states : either oxidised or reduced, depending on the reducing ability of the gas (see fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Qualitatively, the XANES analysis and the distances to the first neighbours detected in the Fourier transforms of the normalised patterns can be correlated with an oxidized state characterized by Pt-O bondings (PtO, type) and a reduced state characterized by Pt-X bondings (CO or Pt) (see fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). An important metallic particle size effect has also been detected : the change in the white line is particularly pronounced (see fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) for the smallest particle concentrations. They correspond to the finest particles. In the case of 12% Pt film a very weak evolution has still be observed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Michel LABEAU, Laboratoire Materiaux et Genie Physique (LMGP), ENSPG-INPG, UMR 5628 CNRS, BP 46 38402 Saint Martin d'Heres France Bernard CHENEVIER LMGP Mounir GAIDI LMGP Jean-Louis HAZEMANN Laboratoire de Geophysique Interne et Tectonophysique, URA 733, BP 53, F-38041 Grenoble Cedex</figDesc></figure>
