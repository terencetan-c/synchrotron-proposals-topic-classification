<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Serpentinites forming in subduction zone environments present a major sink for fluid-mobile elements at depth [1-2]. Ni-enriched serpentines forming in laterites from the alteration of ultramafic rocks in turn can retain much more than 30 % of NiO, presenting Nickel-ore deposits of great importance for industry <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Because of the experimental challenges, which include the low elemental concentrations and the generation of high P/T conditions, our knowledge on how these elements are absorbed, transported and released at depth, during the formation and stepwise breakdown of serpentine is mainly based on field observations and ex-situ fluid inclusion studies [4,5]. We have therefore conducted experiments on the EXAFS beamline BM23 of the ESRF to study the serpentine formation and breakdown in a resistively heated diamond anvil cell.</p><p>In a first step, we tracked in-situ the absorption and release of Ni during serpentine involved reactions. We choosed Ni because it is after Fe the second most enriched element in serpentine minerals <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, allowing us to characterize and optimize the experimental setup. For the experiment, the X-ray beam was tuned to the energy of the Ni K-edge (8.339 keV) using a double-crystal fixed exit monochromator equipped with two Si(111) crystals. Beam focusing to 6 × 6 μm 2 and harmonic rejection was achieved through a Kirkpatrick Baez mirror system with Pt coating. EXAFS and XRF measurements were conducted in fluorescence mode using a Si SDD Vortex detector in backscattering geometry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We used external and internally heated diamond anvil cells equipped with one full single-crystal diamond on the transmission side and one fully perforated singe-crystal diamond sealed with a nano-crysatline diamond window on the backscattering side. XRF, XANES and EXAFS data were acquired at different P/T points to track the Ni-fluid concentration and the formation of new solid phases. 1) For the formation reaction of serpentine we loaded a synthetic crystal of forsterite (Mg2SiO4) together with a ruby crystal and a NiCl2 solution containing 0.5 m NaCl and 2500 ppm Ni and pressurized to 0.3 GPa. Nickel speciation in the fluid was than tracked from XAS measurements (Figure 2). The sample pressure and temperature was than raised to 0.3 GPa and a 300 ̊ C using an externally heated diamond anvil cell for more than 12 hours. Serpentine formation reaction kinetics are very sluggish in nature but are enhanced by Al from one week to 36 hours [5]. We could observe very fast absorption of Ni from the fluid already after one hour after P/T stabilization by the newly formed serpentine. Nickel was than completely absorbed from the fluid after 3 hours (Figure 3). Few amounts of Ni 0 form close to ruby spheres at 25 °C and 0.4 GPa (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3 C</ref>). Ni 0 forms also during the reaction at 300 °C and 0.4 GPa. Ni 0 formation on the ruby is related to oxidation of Cr 3+ to Cr 6+ , triggered by the differences in redox potentials between Ni and Cr. This is an interesting result, showing that the addition of ruby in the sample chamber has influence on the redox buffering. During the reaction XRD images were taken evidencing the formation of Ni-serpentine (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The XRD data will be than combined with high-quality EXAFS spectra obtained from the newly formed serpentine to better constrain the incorporation mechanism of Ni (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).  2) For the breakdown of serpentine a synthetic Ni-serpentine with 2.5 wt% of Ni was loaded together with a 0.5 NaCl solution in an internally heated DAC. XAS spectra in the solid phase were acquired up to 1100 C and 4.4 GPa. We could observe the sequence of breakdown reaction of serpentine to forsterite and enstatite and finally the breakdown of enstatite to forsterite (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We could however not observe any fluid signature in the XANES spectra suggesting that Ni is entirely transferred to the solid phases during serpentine breakdown. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Experimental setup</head><p>The setup used in the experiments, including the diamond anvil design and the measurement geometry was especially developed for experiments on low Z and low concentration elements in resistively heated diamond anvil cells (see report . The present experiments have shown that this setup can be used on fluid samples up to more than 1100 C and 4.4 GPa and for EXAFS measurements down to concentrations of 1000 ppm. Recently we have been able to combine also an online Raman system to this setup for further fluid characterization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Ni behavior during serpentine involved reactions</head><p>We successfully conducted serpentine formation and breakdown experiments tracking the concentration of Ni in the fluid phases and newly formed solid phases. The acquired data are of high quality and are unique since they present the first in-situ data on this topic. We have found an extreme high absorption potential of newly formed serpentine for Ni from a fluid phase, indicating that Ni might be most likely mobilized in lateritic ore deposits and transported over a very short distance until serpentine forms. By comparison of XRD, EXAFS and XANES data from the synthetic and natural samples we will be able to understand better the incorporation mechanism of Ni in Ni-enriched serpentine deposits. Nickel contained in Serpentine subducted via slabs in turn might not be mobilized during its breakdown in the released fluid rather than being subducted further by anhydrous phases. Detailed data analysis is in progress and results are foreseen to be published in a high profile international journal this year.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
