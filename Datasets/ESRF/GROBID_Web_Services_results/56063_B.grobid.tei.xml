<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of the experiment was to investigate the thermally induced hysteretic transition between the high-spin (HS) and low-spin (LS) states of cobalt(II) in the mononuclear complex Co II (dpzca) 2 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. To do so, we have performed XAS and XMCD measurements at the Co K-edge. As a reference system, measurements were also performed on the pyrazine-pyridine analogue, Co II (pypzca) 2 , which was reported to remain HS down to 4K.</p><p>Both samples were mounted in the form of pressed pellets in the 17 Tesla cryomagnet. XMCD and XAS spectra were collected for Co(dpzca) 2 and Co(pypzca) 2 first at T=295K, then at T=100K, where the spin conversion is expected to be complete according to standard magnetometric techniques [1], and at T=2K. While the XAS spectrum of the reference sample Co(pypzca) 2 does not change with temperature, there are significant differences in the XAS spectral signature of Co(dpzca) 2 at high temperature (T=295K) and at low temperature (T=100K and T=2K). Although the agreement between theory and experiment can still be improved in the future, the measured variations are actually as significant as those predicted by our preliminary Ligand Field Calculations, which were shown in the submitted proposal. XMCD is detected in the pre-edge region and is associated to electric quadrupole transitions towards unoccupied 3d states. The effect is very small (a few 10 -4 ) at ambient temperature in both samples. As expected, it grows significantly at low temperature in Co(pypzca) 2 . On the other hand, the XMCD of Co(dpzca) 2 remains very small at 100K, which is also consistent with a transition from HS to LS states of the Co II ion. The very good-quality XMCD at 2.2K allows a fine comparison between the Co(pypzca) 2 (HS) and the Co II (dpzca) 2 (LS) spectra. The XAS and XMCD spectra will be further interpreted by the means of more advanced Ligand Field Multiplet calculations for the pre-edge region and of relativistic DFT calculations for the edge region.</p><p>Taking advantage of the significant differences observed in the XAS spectrum of Co II (dpzca) 2 between 295K and 100K, we further investigated the SCO transition by following the spectral changes as a function of temperature. In the absence of magnetic field, we recorded XAS at 100K, 120K and every 5K between 140K and 200K. Then after increasing the temperature up to 250K we decreased it back, down to 100K. We investigated the progressive changes in the spectra by fitting the spectrum measured at a given temperature as a linear combination of the HS spectrum (200K) and the LS spectrum (100K). The coefficients obtained this way are reported as a function of temperature in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
