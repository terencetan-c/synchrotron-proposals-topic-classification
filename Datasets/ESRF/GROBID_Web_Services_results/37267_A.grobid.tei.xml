<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Our group has discovered that Pd(OAc)2 can catalyze Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) biaryl coupling reactions at room temperature without using any additives. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We observed that the presence of water is crucial for the success of this reaction.</p><p>The goal is to identify the activation and deactivation/decomposition of the Pd catalyst in solution, particularly in the presence of different solvents, reactants and additives by means of the stopped-flow/UV-Vis/Energy Dispersive EXAFS facility of ID24. Reactions examined: 1. Structure of Pd(OAc) Structure of Pd(OAc) Structure of Pd(OAc) Structure of Pd(OAc)2 2 2 2 in solution. in solution. in solution.</p><p>in solution. Although the solid state structure of Pd(OAc)2 has been long established to be trimeric (bridging acetate ligands), 2 there is some controversy surrounding the solution structure of Pd(OAc)2. An earlier QEXAFS study suggests that a solution in NMP assume a monomeric structure 3 , whereas a recent NMR study revealed that the trimeric structure may be retained in solutions of methanol, chloroform and benzene (Scheme 1). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> To probe whether the polarity of solvent can cause substantial dissociation into monomers, the EXAFS spectrum of Pd(OAc)2 is recorded in toluene and DMF -the two most common solvents used in SM reactions. The spectra will be reexamined for any Pd….Pd contacts. Scheme 1. Scheme 1. Scheme 1. Scheme 1.

The toluene solution appears to be structurally closer to the reference sample than the DMF one. EXAFS analysis of this set of data has allowed us to find that both toluene and DMF solutions are in equilibrium between a trimeric and a monomeric structure of the Pd acetate under the experimental working conditions (conc. ≥ 40 mM, T = 25 o C). In the case of the toluene solution this equilibrium is strongly shifted towards the trimeric model. Surprisingly, the more polar DMF solution has also a higher contribution of the timeric model, although the monomeric structure is present in higher degree than in the toluene case. A quantitative multiple component analysis (MCA) is currently underway to asses the percentage of each of these models contributing to the experimental data.

Addition of two equivalents of ArB(OH)2 to a solution of Pd(OAc)2 in anhydrous DMF led to immediate decomposition to Pd black. Interestingly, the process was retarded in the presence of water and inorganic base (K3PO4). This suggest that these additives are able to stabilize the Pd(II) precursor. When two equivalents of arylboronic acid was added to a solution of Pd(OAc)2 in the presence of 5 equivalents of ArBr, the decomposition of Pd can be intercepted by the formation of a new Pd(II) species, observed as an orange solution. EXAFS suggests the formation of a Pd-Br bond (to be confirmed by MS), indicating that oxidative addition has taken place. Thus, we have proven that the oxidative addition of aryl bromides to unligated Pd(OAc)2 can indeed occur under ambient conditions. Furthermore, that the generation of a catalytic active species and decomposition share a common intermediate (Scheme 2 Scheme 2 Scheme 2 Scheme 2).</p><p>Pd 3 (OAc) 6 "S-Pd(OAc) 2 " Ar<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> B(OH) 2 Pd Ar OAc S (probably not) or O Pd OAc OAc B H OH Ar (or H-bonded cpd?)
