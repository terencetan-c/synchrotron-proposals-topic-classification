We have previously shown that the receptor kinase BRI1 binds the steroid hormone using its extracellular spiral shaped leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, and that binding of the hormone creates a docking platform for a shape-complementary co-receptor protein <ref type="bibr">(Hothorn et al., Nature, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>We have used the 3 shifts assigned to us at ID29 to characterise crystals of a ternary complex, consisting of the LRR domain of the receptor BRI1 (a 120 kDa glycoprotein) and shape-complementary co-receptor protein SERK1 (a 35 kDa glycoprotein) held together by the steroid hormone, which acts as a molecular glue (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>). The data collected at the ESRF confirmed a long c-axis (874 Å, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>) and the presence of perfect merohedral twinning (apparent space-group P6522, model refined in P65 with twin law k,h,-l) (Santiago, Henzler &amp; Hothorn, Science, 2013), but did not offer improved diffraction over crystals collected some weeks earlier at SLS beamline PIIX (where they diffracted up to 3.3 Å).</p><p>Because the steroid hormone acts as a molecular glue, we next tested if chemically modified steroid analogues could disrupt the complex and thus act as receptor antagonists. We collected two datasets of the receptor BRI1 in complex with 2' and 2'-hydroxy-modified brassinosteroids, which indeed target the co-receptor binding site (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>). We now use these structures to design and synthesise more potent BRI1 receptor antagonists.</p><p>The cytoplasmic part of the receptor folds into a kinase domain. We could determine the crystal structure of the active, phosphorylated BRI1 kinase domain in complex with ADP, diffracting to 2 Å (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>). This structure helped us to understand: a) why plant membrane receptor kinases are dual-specificity kinases that are able to phosphorylate on Ser/Thr and Tyr residues, b) how the different auto-and transphosphorylation sites contribute to receptor activation, c) how the receptor kinase domain interacts with substrate kinases and with a peptide inhibitor protein <ref type="bibr">(Bojar et al., Plant J, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">10.1111/tpj.12445</ref>; this publication acknowledges use of ESRF ID29 and has been registered as an ESRF publication). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Crystal structures of the extracellular and cytoplasmic portions of a plant steroid receptor signalling complex. a) Surface view of the BRI1-SERK1 ectodomain complex structure. The BRI1 LRR domain is shown in blue, the SERK1 LRR domain in orange. b) Same complex as ribbon diagram. The steroid hormone (in yellow, surface representation) acts as 'molecular glue' promoting association of receptor and co-receptor LRR domain. c) Unit cell of BRI1-SERK1 complex crystals, depicting the long c-axis. d) BRI1 LRR domain in complex with a first receptor antagonist, which binds to BRI1 with nanomolar affinity but does not allow for the binding of the co-receptor. e) Crystal structure of the BRI1 cytoplasmic kinase domain.
