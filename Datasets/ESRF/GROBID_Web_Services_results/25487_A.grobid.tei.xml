<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We report here on X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) studies at the U M 4,5 -edges and Fe-Kedge in a series of U/Fe multilayers with different thicknesses ([U 26 /Fe 29 ] 30 , [U 19 /Fe 33 ] 100 and [U 41 /Fe 6 ] 100 ; the subscripts denotes the layer thickness in Å). The XMCD spectra were measured at 5K and 300K under applied magnetic fields of 0.5 Tesla. The second harmonic of the EMPHU undulator spectrum has been used to record XMCD spectra at the U M 4,5 -edges by flipping the helicity of X-rays at each energy point of the scan. The Uranium M 4,5 spectra were measured using the total fluorescence detection mode. At those edges, self-absorption effects are known to be extremely important and, therefore, one has to correct the spectra. We have extended the procedure for these corrections to take into account the real structure of the multilayer (respective thicknesses in a multilayer and a buffer) and the complete geometry of the experiment (incident angle of X-rays, active area of detector and its position with respect to the sample surface). The validity of this new procedure has been checked by comparing the spectra measured at various angles of incidence. For the experiments at the Fe K-edge, we used the first harmonic of the helical undulator (HU-38) and the XMCD was obtained as the direct difference between XANES spectra recorded with opposite helicities of the X-rays. In both cases (U M 4,5 -edges and Fe K-edge), to ensure that the XMCD spectra are free from any small artificial signals, experiments were performed with two directions of the applied magnetic field (parallel and antiparallel).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we have reproduced the U M 4,5 XMCD spectra recorded at 5K and under 0.5 Tesla field for three multilayers. One can see that there is a strong dependence of the XMCD signals on both U and Fe thicknesses. As the thickness of U layer increases from 19Å to 26Å with the thickness of Fe layer kept approximately constant we observe that the amplitude of the U XMCD signal decreases while its spectral shape does not change. This observation indicates, as expected, that the U 5f induced magnetic moment is not constant across the layer and that the U atoms located at the interfaces carry a larger magnetic moment. For a much thinner Fe layer (~6Å), we observe that the XMCD signal from the 41Å thick U layers is reduced by only 15% confirming the previous observation if one assumes that the Fe moment is the same in all three samples. We would like to underline that the XMCD signal at the U M-edges was also observed at 300K in all multilayers studied. However, the amplitude of the XMCD signals was reduced following the reduction of the Fe magnetization due to the proximity of the respective Curie temperatures T C . The reduction of the U XMCD signal is larger for [U 41 /Fe 6 ] 100 multilayer (~57%) compared to the [U 19 /Fe 33 ] 100 multilayer (~13%) because the Curie temperature of a 6Å thick Fe layer (T C ~400K) is much lower than the one for the 33Å thick layer (nearly the bulk value of Fe T C ~1050K).</p><p>To make sure that the experiments were performed under complete magnetic saturation of the samples, element specific magnetization curves were recorded at the maximum of XMCD spectrum at the U M 4 -edge at 5K for the[U 19 /Fe 33 ] 100 and [U 41 /Fe 6 ] 100 multilayers (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and at 300K for the [U 26 /Fe 29 ] 30 multilayer. In both cases, a nearly square hysteresis loops was observed with a coercive field of 0.016Tesla for thick Fe layers (33Å) and of 0.17 Tesla for thin Fe layers (6Å); this is in a good agreement with what one would expect for thin ferromagnetic films. In fact, the coercive field is inversely proportional to the thickness of the ferromagnetic Fe layers and the U 5f induced moment, to a first approximation, reflects this behaviour. U M 4 U M 5 Norm.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The use of the sum-rules allows one to extract the ground state orbital &lt;L z &gt; and spin &lt;S z &gt; magnetic moments of the U 5f states from the integrated U 4,5 XMCD signals. The spin magnetic moment is, in the case of 5f electrons, is given by &lt;S z &gt; = &lt;S z eff &gt; -3&lt;T z &gt; , where &lt;T z &gt; is the expectation value of the magnetic dipole operator and &lt;S z eff &gt; the value determined from the sum rules. In the case of actinides, the &lt;T z &gt; term is not negligible: in the intermediate coupling scheme, the ratio of &lt;T z &gt; to &lt;S z &gt; is 1.16 and 0.62 for 5f 2 and 5f 3 ground-state configurations, respectively. Moreover, both &lt;L z &gt; and &lt;S z &gt; are dependent on the number of holes in the 5f band, which is, however, unknown due to the strong hybridization of the 5f states. Within these limitationsthe spin and orbital magnetic moment of the U 5f states were evaluated for two possible configurations 5f 2 (U 4+ ) and 5f 3 (U 3+ ). The results are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> presents the Fe K-edge XMCD spectra recorded under the same experimental conditions as U M 4,5 -spectra. In the multilayers with thick Fe layers, we have observed an unexpectedly strong and sharp Fe K-edge XMCD signal. For thin Fe layers (6Å), the Fe K-edge XMCD signal is strongly reduced, by nearly a factor of 10. We think that this sharp XMCD signal is due to quadrupolar 1s-3d transitions and its reduction may be explained by the admixture of the U 5f-states with the Fe 3d-band states. Further work is planned on a new set of U/Fe multilayers.  <ref type="table">1</ref>: Uranium 5f magnetic moments of U/Fe multilayers deduced from XMCD spectra using the theoretical values of the &lt;T z &gt;/&lt;S z &gt; ratio for two possible configurations 5f 2 (U 4+ ) and 5f 3 (U 3+ ).</p></div>
