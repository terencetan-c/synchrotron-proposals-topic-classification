<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have studied the structure and crystalline orientation of Ru and Cu films grown by dc magnetron sputtering as a function of the thickness, the substrate (amorphous fused silica and crystalline sapphire ( <ref type="formula">001</ref>)) and the growth temperature of the films. We have also evaluated the effect of the growth of graphene on the Ru or Cu structure and morphology. We obtained low angle and high angle diffraction patterns in θ-2θ configuration (chi-gamma) to check the periodicity out of plane, perpendicular to the substrate and the rocking curves of the obtained peaks. To evaluate the in-plane orientation of the metallic grains we performed grazing incidence delta scans combined with theta rotation of the samples. We present here some of the results. We are still analysing the data.</p></div>

The delta scans and theta scans in grazing incidence (as that shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) allow us to study the in-plane orientation and lattice parameters of the Ru films. Clearly Ru is also almost totally oriented also in-plane, parallel to the substrate surface.</p></div>
