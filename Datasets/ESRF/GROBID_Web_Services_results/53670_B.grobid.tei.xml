<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In proposal N.33224 we planned to perform EXAFS and XANES measurements in transmission geometry at the Ru K-edge (22117 eV) on 7 powder pellets of Y 2-x (Zn/Mg) x Ru 2 O 7 pyrochlores (with x= 0.00, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 for each Y site doping). These multifunctional oxides are potentially useful as new cathodes in solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) of intermediate temperature.</p><p>In order to accurately follow the behaviour of the local order and structure parameters as a function of temperature we aimed to measure accurate spectra at 18 different temperatures between 298 K and 10 K, thickening the points in the 40 K-85 K range (being the magnetic ordering transition 55 K&lt; T N &lt; 77 K, for all the compositions). The study as a function of temperature would help us to understand the interplay between the structural, magnetic and transport properties. We wanted to check whether any short-ranged structural change is at play around the magnetic transition and how it evolves as a function of doping by Zn or Mg at the Y site.</p><p>March 2014: During the first 10 shifts we experienced serious problems in thermoregulation and temperature stabilizing due to the presence of a leak in the cryostat cold head windows. Consequently, in those days we were able to acquire spectra only between 10 and 80 K on the four Y 2-x Zn x Ru 2 O 7 (with x= 0.00, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) samples. After the cryostat change, a full series of measurements was performed on the undoped compound in the 8 K-298 K range and on the Zn 20% doped one between 84 K and 298 K (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). No more experimental time remained to complete the planned measurements on the other two Zn-doped samples (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) and on the four Mg-doped ones.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we show that in the undoped compound a clear peak in the Debye-Waller  2 (Å 2 ) factor appears in the temperature region around the magnetic transition temperature T N = 77 K suggesting the occurrence of a magneto-elastic coupling or of an additional local disorder. The obtained result is even more significative since in the literature neither a dynamic disorder nor a coupling between a magnetic and a structure transition were observed in these compounds previously studied by other structural techniques like diffraction. On the other hand, Raman data show an anomaly in the temperature dependence of a Raman-active mode thus assuming a spin-phonon coupling which can correspond with what we are seeing. We hypothesize that the observed additional local disorder could be due to the presence of different Ru-O interatomic distances in the RuO 6 octahedra. The model that seems to be the most suitable is based on four shorter and two longer Ru-O distances (~2.00 Å and 2.04 Å at high temperature, respectively). In the re-scheduling beamtime (September 2014) we have measured also the other three samples: Y 2-x Zn x Ru 2 O 7 (with x= 0.10, 0.15, 0.20), in the 8 K-298 K range. The results (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) show for x = 0.10 a remaining less intense peak in  2 (Å 2 ) just above the T N = 55 K new transition temperature and something like a plateau for the other two compositions. Also the doped compounds  2 behaviour deviates from a Debye-like local order model. We hypothesize that Zn doping, due to the lower ionic radius of Zn 2+ respect to that of Y 3+ and to the different oxidation state, determines an increase in the octahedra distortion and a depression of the magnetic transition also observed in a less intense magnetoelastic local effect.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
