<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We had 9 shifts on the Titan KRIOS to collect data on a functional RNA polymerase elongation complex bound to DNA Topoisomerase I. We were scheduled in February 2022 (23/02 -25/05). Our local contact was Alessandro Grinzato. We brought two UltrAuFoil gold grids, which were pre-screened on our Glacios microscope. The grids were shipped a week ahead of the scheduled experiment and stored at the ESRF by our local contact. Thanks to the outstanding support by our local contact we were able to select enough squares and holes and collect data that gave us more than 21.500 images over the course of the two days. We had collected on this RNA polymerase elongation complex before but needed additional data because the earlier reconstruction did not refine to high resolution and it was clear that the complex adopts multiple different conformational states. We brought two grids frozen and our local contact helped us screen those grids and select a suitable one for data collection. He selected all the holes for data acquisition and everything went extremely smooth. We would not have been able to get the quality and size of the dataset without his support.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Update July 15 th 2022:</head><p>The data has now been processed and refined by Vita Vidmar. We have several reconstructions: 1) RNAP in complex with DNA topoisomerase I at about 2.7A resolution; and 2) RNAP alone as a result of 3D classification at 2.5A resolution. The RNAP Topoisomerase I complex will play a critical role in a publication on the interplay of transcription and DNA topology. The RNAP alone, while not providing newbiological insights, is one of the highest resolution reconstruction of E. coli RNAP and we plan to use to provide a better refined model for the community.</p></div>			</div>
