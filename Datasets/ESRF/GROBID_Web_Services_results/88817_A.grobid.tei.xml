<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>During the last decade, ALD has emerged as an effective method to deposit noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) with a precise control of the particle morphology (size and areal density), which has promising potential applications in heterogeneous catalysis (Pt, Pd) and plasmonics (Au, Ag). Here, our home built ALD system enabling in situ monitoring of the NP morphology and loading by GISAXS and XRF measurements has been exploited to study the nanoparticle nucleation and formation during ALD growth of Pd. Preceding work revealed that the use of different plasma reactants influences the growth rate during steady Pd growth (Pd on Pd). Furthermore, it had been reported in literature that a trimethylaluminium (TMA)-based treatment can improve the nucleation on Al2O3 surfaces. 1 During this synchrotron campaign, we aim to figure out how these different processes influence the Pd NP growth and morphology evolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>GISAXS patterns were recorded using the Pilatus 1M detector of the beamline, using an acquisition time of 30s. The Xray energy was set to 11.9 kev. The distance between sample and detector was 4.4m, while the incident angle was 0.5°. XRF spectra were simultaneously recorded using a Vortex detector. Pd NPs were deposited on Al2O3 (7nm ALD deposited) and native SiO2/Si substrates at 150°C by alternating exposure of Palladium(II)hexafluoroacetylacetonate Pd(hfac)2 and H2, H2+O2, O2+H2 plasma as reactants. In some cases a pretreatment based on TMA was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>First, in situ GISAXS was used to monitor the island density as a function of the reactant choice (H2 plasma, H2+O2 plasma or O2+H2 plasma) and on different substrates (7nm Al2O3 on Si and SiO2). The deposition temperature was kept constant at 150°C. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the results for Pd NPs deposited on Al2O3 by different plasma combinations. The Pd loading, derived from the in situ XRF measurements, versus ALD cycles graph shows that Pd NPs grown with H2 plasma and O2+H2 plasma have a similar nucleation delay at lower loadings while Pd NPs grown with H2+O2 nucleate faster in the beginning. At higher loadings, the 3 processes show a growth rate which matches our earlier steady growth study. The GISAXS patterns recorded in situ for the 3 processes reveal a clear difference in the morphological evolution of the Pd NPs, where we estimate the center-to-center distance (D) between neighboring NPs as 2π/qy,max, with qy,max the qyposition of the main scattering peak. The particle density (estimated as 1/D 2 with D equal to the center to center distance plotted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) is different for the three processes, with the H2+O2 plasma process yielding the highest particle density. The process that uses only H2 plasma also shows a more static growth, with an almost constant particle density, while for the processes with O2 plasma the particle density gradually decreases (somewhat similar to previous results obtained for Pt ALD). 2 Also the shape of the scattering signal is different for the pure H2 plasma process, showing a clear interference ring, while this scattering ring is less prominent when O2 plasma is incorporated. This indicates for a different shape of the NPs. More detailed analysis of these results is ongoing. Secondly, the combination of processes with H2 plasma and H2+O2 plasma was also performed during this campaign (scattering patterns not shown). The main conclusion is that by combining the processes, we can tune the nucleation areal density and morphology evolution of the ALD Pd NPs. However, the tuning range is rather limited and this motivated the next study, focused on introducing TMA exposures during the first Pd ALD cycles. Indeed, thirdly, in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, Pd NPs were deposited on Si using the H2 plasma-based process with and without TMA pulse in the first ten ALD cycles. The Pd NPs growth with TMA treatment shows an obvious faster nucleation than the growth without TMA treatment, whose long nucleation delay is due to the surface poisoning generated from reaction between the surface and ALD byproducts. By introducing a TMA pulse during the first cycles, these poisoning surface groups could effectively be removed. Moreover, GISAXS patterns at similar loading throughout both processes show quite different morphology of the Pd NPs when grown with or without TMA treatment. The estimated center-to-center distance (D) between neighboring NPs shows that Pd NPs with TMA treatment in the first ALD cycles have a denser distribution with small particle size, while Pd NPs without TMA treatment show a dispersed distribution with larger particle size at the same Pd loadings. This difference in particle density has been confirmed by ex situ SEM images. More detailed analysis of the GISAXS data is ongoing, together with the preparation of a manuscript on this topic. Finally, Pd NPs grown with different cycles of TMA treatment (0, 1, 3, 10) at the same loading were measured with ex situ GISAXS (scattering patterns not shown). The data show that the areal density of the Pd NPs can be varied between the two processes analyzed in situ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p></div>
