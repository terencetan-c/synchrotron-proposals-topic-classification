<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This experiment was awarded six shifts from March 11 th to 13 th , 2002. It is a direct continuation of MI-392 (February 2 th to 4 th , 2000) and was expected to proceed smoothly because the method had been proven. The initial setup required significant effort in constructing the lead castle, beam alignment, etc. Much of this work was done on March 10 th . The samples were inserted into the beam and blasted with Xrays from the wiggler. The samples did not heat up and melt as expected. Instead the beam tended to punch holes in the samples. This was rarely observed in the previous run. Samples with the same composition that was used in MI-392 were inserted into the beam. They heated up and melted as expected. This was as important diagnostic result that focused attention on the samples in this run MI-527. In preparing the samples there was one major change in composition i.e. Fe 2 O 3 was used instead of Fe 3 O 4 . The changes in composition was enough to turn the new samples into almost perfect insulators and hence the heat was not conducted throughout the samples. In the cosmic case however the samples would be uniformly irradiated and have no need to rely on the thermal conductivity of the material.</p><p>There are two changes that should be made for the next run. 1) irradiate the full sample and check the thermal properties of the sample.</p><p>2) make significant changes to the pressure container to make monitoring of the temperature, TV camera, samples more efficient.</p><p>Overall the run was not as expected but the reasons are well understood.
