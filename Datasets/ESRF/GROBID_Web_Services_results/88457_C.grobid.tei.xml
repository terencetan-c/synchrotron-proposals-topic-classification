<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During this beamtime, we performed resonant X-ray diffraction (RXD) measurements at the Fe K-edge and Co K-edge on the Fe and Co-based ludwigites. The purpose of the experiment was to track charge order signatures using RXD in both compounds and to reveal its coupling with the magnetic ordering at low temperature. This experiment was challenging due, principally, to the sample sizes (100m*50m*50m for Fe3BO5 and  200m*80m*80m for Co3BO5). Despite this difficulty, the experiment was feasible and satisfactory since we managed to orient and measure both samples.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>For this study, we used the Kappa diffractometer and a closed cycle He cryostat in azimuthal geometry. The Fe3BO5 and Co3BO5 samples were glued at the tips of 100 m diameter quartz capillaries. Then, the capillaries were mounted on a Copper sample holder which was inserted inside the cryostat. To save time, both Fe3BO5 and Co3BO5 samples were mounted together on the Copper sample holder and we took advantage of the precise translational stage of the Kappa diffractometer to go from one sample to another. Two different edges [Fe K-edge (7.12 keV) and Co K-edge (7.72 keV)] were used with a 100 m-size focused beam which allowed to measure resonant effects in both Fe3BO5 and Co3BO5 samples. By using the closed cycle He cryostat, we were able to realize precise temperature dependence measurements, from 32 K to 325 K.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (a) shows a Lscan along the (0 2 L) direction in the Fe3BO5 sample at both 32 K and 325 K (i.e. below and above the charge ordering transition temperature, TCO  283 K). At 32 K, below TCO, superstructure peaks are observed at L = n/2 (n an integer). These additional low temperature peaks are the signature of a structural distortion, concomitant with the charge ordering. This structural distortion corresponds to a doubling of the cell along the c-axis. This observation confirmed a previous work, where the structural distortion was already mentioned <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.  In contrast to the 7.108 or 7.150 keV peaks, these #1 and #2 peaks are energy independent when changing the azimuthal angle , meaning that they cannot be attribute to multiple scattering peaks. In addition, the intensity of the (1 0 -2) reflection is zero just below the Fe K-edge indicating that this reflection is purely resonant. The temperature dependence of this resonant reflection is shown on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 (d)</ref>. No clear effects are observed, neither at both magnetic ordering transitions (TN1  70K and TN2  110K), nor above the charge ordering transition temperature [see inset of the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 (d)]</ref>. This observation indicates that the (1 0 -2) reflection is not a signature of the crystallographic site where the charge ordering occurs. Then, we measured energy scans on many other reflections which are not presented here. These energy scans were only recorded at low temperature due to a lack of time. Finally, despite our preparation of the Co3BO5 sample, we did not have enough time to start the low temperature measurements on this sample, especially because of a technical issue, which led to one night of measurement lost.</p><p>To short, this experiment was challenging, but feasible and satisfactory. Despite the small sizes of the samples, we were able to measure many reflections at different temperatures, energies, azimuthal angles and at two different edges. The data analysis is still in progress: we are working on a procedure to correct the absorption and we are also simulating the resonant profile of the measured reflections using the FDMNES software <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, in order to compare our data with the charge order model proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Yet, more beamtime is needed to conduct a complete temperature dependence study on the other reflections we have measured at low temperature during this experiment. In addition, it would be interesting, for a comparison, to prospect the other ludwigite sample (Co3BO5), where a charge ordering was suspected but not directly detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. This was not possible this time because of limited time allocation. Therefore, we will propose to continue this study in the next cycle.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Lscans along the (0 2 L) direction at 32 K and 325 K in the Fe3BO5 sample.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure1(b) reports energy scans of the (0 2 -1.5) reflection in the Fe3BO5 sample, near the Fe K-edge, at several temperatures, from 32 K to 135 K. A small resonant effect is observed around 7.120 keV and in the low temperature data (see red arrow). Nevertheless, an absorption correction is required to reveal its complete resonant profile. Figure1 (c) and (d) show an azimuthal and temperature dependence of the energy scans on the (1 0 -2) reflection in the Fe3BO5 sample. In Figure (c), a resonant profile is observed with the presence of two peaks at 7.120 and 7.125 keV (peaks #1 and #2). In contrast to the 7.108 or 7.150 keV peaks, these #1 and #2 peaks are energy independent when changing the azimuthal angle , meaning that they cannot be attribute to multiple scattering peaks. In addition, the intensity of the (1 0 -2) reflection is zero just below the Fe K-edge indicating that this reflection is purely resonant. The temperature dependence of this resonant reflection is shown on Figure1 (d). No clear effects are observed, neither at both magnetic ordering transitions (TN1  70K and TN2  110K), nor above the charge ordering transition temperature [see inset of the Figure1 (d)]. This observation indicates that the (1 0 -2) reflection is not a signature of the crystallographic site where the charge ordering occurs.
