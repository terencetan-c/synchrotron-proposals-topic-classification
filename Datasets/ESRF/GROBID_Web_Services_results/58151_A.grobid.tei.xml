<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The general purpose of experiment MX-1765 was to investigate the structure of extracellular membrane vesicles (exosomes) and to determine the experimental conditions and feasibility to model the electronic density profile in such a complex system. Therefore we performed a series of measurement of exosomes obtained from different cell lines and with different treatments, as specified in the caption of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. While the modelling of these curves will require a challenging effort, we notice the remarkable qualitative peculiarity of exosomes extracted from vegetal cells (lemon), as expected from our recent results <ref type="bibr">(Raimondo et al. 2015 Oncotarget 6:19514-19527)</ref>. The more specific aim was to study and identify any structural difference in vesicles released by muscle cells in relation to a different extent of protein lipidation, which was shown to regulate membrane biogenesis <ref type="bibr">(Romancino et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">FEBS Lett. 587:1379</ref><ref type="bibr">-1384</ref>). Therefore we extracted exosomes from muscle cell treated with an inhibitor of protein palmitoylation (EX-2BP) and compared them with exosomes extracted from untreated cells (EX-CTR). Larger size micro vesicles were also extracted from the same 2BP treated (MV-2BP) and untreated (MV-CTR) cellular lines. The size and shape of vesicles were previously controlled on the same preparation by Dinamic Light Scattering, performed at our home laboratory, and by Atomic Force Microscopy, performed at the PSCM facility of the ESRF. The scattering intensities measured in direct injection experiments show a similar pattern with a more structured character in the case of smaller exosome with respect to micro vesicles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Since a main difficulty is given by vesicles heterogeneity, we made an attempt to use HPLC separation for some type of vesicles. However the initial concentration (estimated as 1mg/ml in total protein content) was too low to allow a reliable signal to noise ratio. Rep. 5:13666): C1-Inhibitor (C1I) and Neuroserpin (NS). C1I was measured in physiological buffer at different concentrations. The form factor was determined at low concentration (with Rg=5.75 nm) both by direct injection and by measuring the elution peak from HPLC column. The I(q) was factorised to determine the structure factor in the curves at high concentrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). We notice the prevalence of a repulsive contribution (likely due to electric charges) and at the same time a peak around 0.6 nm-1, related to a small range attractive contribution.</p><p>The last measurement was done upon HPLC separation of a specific protein complex: a homodimer made by two monomers of the neuroserpin N157C mutant linked by the induced sulfur bridge. The measure was successfully fit by SASREF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>The remaining time was dedicated to other systems of our interest, two serpin proteins(Noto et al. 2015 Sci.    </figDesc></figure>
