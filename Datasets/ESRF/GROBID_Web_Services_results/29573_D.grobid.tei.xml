Although positioned close together, very large differences in the composition of the inclusions are noticeable, as can be seen in the two sum spectra that are shown. Both inclusions contain Fe as a major compoment, but one of them is associated with Cr and Ni while in the other Mn is present at a concentration level ca. 30-50 times lower than Fe.

In the Tirich region, the XRD data show a prominent peak at d = 3.8 Å, suggesting that we may be dealing here with an CaTi-perovskite structure. Thus, this inclusion is likely to consist of walstromite-structured CaSiO 3 and CaTiO 3 . Such a phase assemblage can be interpreted as a former CaSi 1-x Ti x O 3 -perovskite solid solution, requiring a minimum pressure of ca 9.5GPa to form.  2.b.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>The first 1½ days of this experiment were devoted to the alignment and characterization of a newly developed SU-8 CRL lens by ANKA GmbH. To this effect, Dr. V. Nazmov of ANKA GmbH joined us at the start of the experiment (from 10/11/05 to 13/11/05). By gradual adjustments of the number of horizontal and vertical CRL lenses in the series designed for 28 keV, an X-ray beam with quasi circular cross-section could be produced, with an effective diameter of 1 µm and comparable intensity as obtained with the 'standard' Al-CRL lenses available at ID18F. The smallest beam size measured was 0.6 x 0.4 µm 2 . A thin gold teststructure, provided by V. Nazmov was used to measure the beam size. Thus, considerably higher resolution 2D images could be recorded than in the previous experimental sessions, where the beam size was typically 2 x 10 µm 2 . A high-intensity, high-energy beam with cross-section of ca 1 µm diameter is very convenient for examining inclusions in diamonds down to ca 5 µm diameter. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PC CRL S T</head><p>Because of the short focal distance of the newly characterized CRL lens (ca 2 cm), a fairly compact geometry around the sample needed to be employed, as shown in the photograph below. The geometrry and the efficiency of the CRL lens were regularly monitored during our experiment and that following us <ref type="bibr">(18-11-05 -22-11-05;</ref>no decrease in performance or other signs of radiation-induced degradation was noticed during this 10 day period. On 22-11-05, a vertical beamsize of ca 1.5 um was recorded, probably due to slight misaligment of the lens relative to the cross-collimator slits used in front and due to the use of a fairly large opening of these slits. Before the detector, a short (3 cm long) polycapillary lens was used to select the depth in the sample from which the fluorescent radiation can reach the detector. Due to the shorter overall distance the fluorescent photons need to travel through the glass channels of the lens, a 5x larger fluorescent yield for the transition elements was realised. This factor of 5 compensates the losses in primary flux associated with the use of the more strongly focussing CRL lens in combination with the cross-slits.</p><p>The following diamond inclusions were measured for the first time or remeasured with higher resolution:</p><p>(a) in conventional XRF mode, inclusion Kankan200#4 (RS-35) was scanned again, in order to obtain the total projected distribtion of the REE and other elements at higher resolution. In the previous experiment, this inclusion was already investigated with confocal µ-XRF, but by means of a larger primary beam. The graphite 'wings' are clearly visible in the resulting elemental maps (100x100 points) since they are enriched in the elements that are enriched in the rim of the inclusion proper. (b) in confocal XRF mode, the following inclusions were measured by combined XRD and confocal XRF: RS59 diamond RS59-a dolomite, magnesian calcite XRF + XRD RS59-b coexisting carbonates XRF + XRD RS59-c calcite + dolomite, chromite (?)

The co-localization of the elements Fe, Sr, Th and Pb is clearly visible in these maps. In comparison to the conventional XRF maps shown above, the clearly the distribution of elements within the outer shell of the inclusion is shown. Also the existence of small rectangular Pb-and Th-rich crystals, a few micrometers in size near the outer surface of the inclusion are visible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Planned experimental sessions</head><p>More high resolution local X-ray fluorescence tomography are planned to study reaction volumes within composite diamond inclusions. These high-resolution studies will require the installation of the new generation of polymer CRLs with sub-micron capabilities.

Adams; "Three-dimensional trace element analysis by confocal X-ray microfluorescence imaging"; Analytical Chemistry 76 ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>), 6786-6791, 2004. Abstract. A three-dimensional (3D) variant of scanning micro X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is described and evaluated at the ID18F instrument of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The method is based on confocal excitation/detection using a polycapillary half-lens in front of the energy dispersive detector. The experimental arrangement represents a significant generalization of regular twodimensional (2D) scanning micro-XRF and employs a detector half-lens whose focus coincides with that of the focused incoming beam. The detection volume defined by the intersection of the exciting beam and the energy dependent acceptance of the polycapillary optics is 100-350 µm 3 . Minimum detection limits are sub-ppm and sensitivities are comparable with regular scanning XRF. Next to the reduction of in-sample single/multiple scattering, the set-up provides the possibility of sample depthscans with an energy dependent resolution of 10-35 µm in the energy range of 3-23 keV, and the possibility of performing 3D-XRF analysis by simple XYZ linear scanning. This provides a suitable alternative to X-ray fluorescence tomography. The method is illustrated with results of the analysis of solid inclusions in diamond and fluid inclusions in quartz. • B.

Spectrom., 19 (10), 1302</ref><ref type="bibr">-1308</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2004</ref>. Abstract. A novel polycapillary based confocal X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique was applied for the first time at the ID18F beamline of the ESRF to obtain directly 3-dimensional (3D) compositional information of an inclusion inside a natural diamond sample (KK200). Preliminary analysis of the results on the basis of the trace elements Sr, Y/Zr, and Th suggest three phases, two of which were identified by earlier micro-Raman spectroscopy as larnite (β-Ca 2 SiO 4 ) and CaSiO 3 -walstromite, two minerals with significantly different Ca content. In order to support this multiphase model for the investigated inclusion the data set was analysed combining the conventional multivariate method of PCA and K-means clustering procedure after application of instrument specific routines such as spectral evaluation and normalization. Through the knowledge of the full spatial 3D structure of the different phases, it was possible to correct for absorption of the fluorescent radiation in the different phases of the inclusion and the surrounding diamond. • F.

Harris; "Evidence for a Ca-rich lithology in the Earth's deep upper mantle"; Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 2005, in press. Abstract. Earth's deep convecting upper mantle is believed to represent a rather homogenous geochemical reservoir of spinel or garnet lherzolite with primitive major element and moderately depleted trace element composition. Only where subduction occurs is this homogeneity disrupted by a suite of rocks ranging from eclogites/garnet pyroxenites (former oceanic crust) to residual harzburgites.</p><p>In addition to these well documented peridotitic and metabasaltic rocks we have now discovered the presence of a chemically distinct reservoir in the deep upper mantle. In situ structural analyses (micro Xray diffraction and micro Raman spectroscopy) and three-dimensional trace element mapping (confocal micro X-ray fluorescence imaging) of polyphase inclusions in a diamond from Guinea that formed at about 300-360 km depth reveal the existence of a deep Ca-rich source, in the absence of several common mantle minerals, like olivine, garnet and Ca-poor pyroxene. This reservoir may represent metasomatized oceanic lithosphere (rodingites, ophicarbonates) or metamorphosed carbonaceous sediments. • R. Terzano, M. Spagnuolo, L. Medici, B. Vekemans, L.

This study deals with the process of zeolite formation in an agricultural soil artificially polluted by high amounts of Cu (15 mg of Cu/g of soil dry weight) and treated with fused coal fly ash at 30 and 60 °C and how this process affects the mobility and availability of the metal. As a consequence of the treatment, the amount of dissolved Cu, and thus its mobility, was strongly reduced, and the percentage of the metal stabilized in the solid phase increased over time, reaching values of 30% at 30 °C and 40% at 60 °C. The physicochemical phenomena responsible for Cu stabilization in the solid phase have been evaluated by EDTA sequential extractions and synchrotron radiation based X-ray microanalytical techniques. These techniques were used for the visualization of the spatial distribution and the speciation of Cu in and/or on the neo-formed zeolite particles. In particular, micro XRF (X-ray fluorescence) tomography showed direct evidence that Cu can be entrapped as clusters inside the porous zeolitic structures while í-XANES (X-ray absorption near edge structure) spectroscopy determinations revealed Cu to be present mainly as Cu(II) hydroxide and Cu(II) oxide. The reported results could be useful as a basic knowledge for planning new technologies for the on site physicochemical stabilization of heavy metals in heavily polluted soils. • R. Terzano, M. Spagnuolo, L. Medici, F. Tateo, B. Vekemans, K. Janssens, P. Ruggiero, "Spectroscopic investigation on the chemical forms of Cu during the synthesis of zeolite X at low temperature", accepted in Applied Geochemistry, to appear in 2006. Abstract: The direct synthesis of zeolites in polluted soils has proved to be a promising process for the stabilisation of toxic metals inside these minerals. More detailed information about this process is still needed in order to better foresee the fate of heavy metals in treated soils. In this work zeolite X has been synthesized under alkaline conditions in an aqueous solution containing 2500 mg kg-1 of Cu, starting from sodium silicate and aluminium hydroxide at 60°C. Aluminium, Si, and Cu concentration in the aqueous phase, during zeolite synthesis, has been measured over a period of 160 hours. The solid products have been characterized over time by SEM-EDX, ESR, FT-IR, and synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction (µ-XRD), X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF) and X-ray microbeam Absorption Near Edge Structure (µ-XANES) and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (µ-EXAFS) spectroscopy. It appears that the marked reduction of Cu concentration in solution is not only due to a simple precipitation effect, but also to processes connected with the formation of zeolite X which could entrap, inside its porous structure, nano-or microocclusions of precipitated copper hydroxides and/or oxides. In addition, EXAFS observations strengthen the hypothesis of the presence of different Cu phases even at a short-range molecular level and let suppose that some of these occlusions could be even bound to the zeolite framework. All the reported findings could be of particular interest since the discussed process could be technologically driven in order to reduce the availability of heavy metals in polluted soils.</p></div>
