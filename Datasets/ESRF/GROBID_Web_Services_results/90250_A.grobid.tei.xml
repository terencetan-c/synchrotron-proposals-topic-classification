<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this project, we have applied in operando wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) to study structural transformations and determine the active phase of Cu oxides-derived (OD-Cu) electrocatalysts during electrochemical reduction CO2 in aquous electrolyte <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> . OD-Cu catalysts have been reported to exhibit high catalytic selectivity towards value-added C2+ products for CO2RR, with turnable areal particle density <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and surface roughness. However, the nature of the catalytic active sites, such as uncoordinated sites, residual oxides, subsurface oxygen, are still under debate. In the operating condition, the transient changes of products formation on OD-Cu catalysts is directly caused by catalyst surface reconstruction when oxygen is removed. The resulting reduced copper is prone to re-react with oxygen and get corroded in unavoidable oxygen and moisture surrounding. In this case, in operando detection techniques are of vital importance in time-scale. For this reason we synthesized free-standing 2-dimentional (2D) copper oxide nanosheets (CuOx NS), exposing predominantly {001} facets, and investigate CO2RR performance in both liquid H-cell configuration and industry-relevant micro flow cell. The highly active CuOx NS are used as a catalyst precursor while exhibit ordinary stability towards C2H4. The evolution of initial catalyst phase that undergoes at different overpotentials is investigated with in operando WAXS. For electrochemical testing, a catalyst ink was prepared with unsupported catalyst particles and drop casted onto glassy carbon (GC) electrodes. A grazing incident diffraction (GID) cell was necessary due to strong preferential diffraction caused by the stacking of the CuO nanosheets, which excluded the use of transmission setup with the X-ray beam parallel to the stacking direction. Therefore, the experiments were performed with the GID cell, based on thin film concept. A peek foil was used as X-ray window. X-ray attenuation due to the thick electrolyte film was reduced significantly thanks to the high-energy X-ray radiation. In the experiments, three different constant overpotentials and cyclic voltammetry scanning were applies with same CuOx NS catalyst loadings of 25 μg cm -2 . The electrochemical measurements showed same behaviour with what was observed in our laboratory. Therefore the potential-dependent WAXS was measured from the beginning of Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) and accquired every 3 min during the reduction reaction protocol and in a following constant potential scan, spanning the range from the relative lower potentials to higher overpotentials. Taking the reduction reation at -0.84 VRHE as an special bias, where showed a considerable C2H4 formation but no CH4, the initial CuO phase started to vanish during the potential-hold region. The initial CuO phase was reduced within the first 30 min, while a small portion of a residual oxide phase lasted for almost 120 min (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The appearance of a metallic copper phase is particularly evident in the 111 diffraction peak (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). The post-formed metallic phase remianed unaffected after complete reduction. This transit tranfermation confirms the necessity to use in operando techniques to characterize this metallic phase, which is easily re-oxidised when the potential is stopped. The investigations with diferent potentials also show the phase evolution speeds up with higher overpotentials, which affects the products distribution. Besides, the CuOx NS exhibits strongly prefered oreintation when drop casted onto glassy carbon electrodes. The diffraction patterns are mainly contributed by the CuO phase, while a small reflection due to an additional Cu2O phase is also observed with low angle (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). The higher order Cu (I) peaks appear absent. It can be seen that the (002) and (11-1) reflections of Cu (II) exhibit a stronger intensity in the meridional direction, demonstrating that the CuOx nanosheets are stacked along the &lt;00l&gt; direction and that this one is perpendicular to the incident beam. A partial contour plot is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>, indicating the coexistence of both the Cu2O phase and the CuO phase. The distribution of scattering intensity was obtained by integration of the 2D detector GI-WAXS image numerically, which is hardly observed by point-detector in the lab.</p><p>In conclusions, in operando WAXS revealed to be a powerful technique to trace the phase evolution of CuOx NS with strongly preferred orientation during operating electrochemical reduction process for CO2RR, indicating a complete conversion from the initial copper oxide phase to catalytically active metallic copper phase. Together the materials and kinetic catalytic study presented here on previously unexplored sheet-like CuOx nanoparticles have established valuable structure-activity-selectivity correlations for future catalyst designs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: a) In operando WAXS showing the reflections of CuO in CuOx NS vanishes and metallic copper forms with time at 0.84 V vs. RHE in CO2-saturated 0.1M KHCO3. b).
