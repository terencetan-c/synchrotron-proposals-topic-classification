We were able, for the first time, to monitor the development of texture and in-plane orientation in-situ for epitaxial monocrystalline films chemically deposited from solution. Our previous studies revealed that PbS has a tendency to develop with a <ref type="bibr">[110]</ref> orientation on the GaAs(100) substrates. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the GIXD rocking curve of the (220) PbS Bragg reflection obtained from thin epitaxial PbS film deposited on GaAs(100) from an alkaline solution containing Pb(NO 3 ) 2 , CS(NH 2 ) 2 and NaOH at 30°C for various periods of time. a b</p><p>The graphs indicate decrease in FWHM of the ( <ref type="formula">220</ref>) PbS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) with increasing deposition time that was accompanied by increasing film thickness. This indicates that the film quality is improving with thickness (i.e., with deposition time), strongly confirming our previously obtained in-house observations. In addition, slight shift of the (220) PbS peak position towards (220) GaAs were observed. However, in films deposited for longer than 180 min, a sharp decrease in the (220) PbS intensity was obtained (not shown). This could be either due to dissolution of the film as the solution reaches equilibrium or (more likely) may be due to residual stresses above a critical thickness which result in peeling of the films from the substrate surface. In addition, GIXD radial θ/2θ scan at the vicinity of ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>  Interestingly, in-house SEM examination of the samples surfaces after the synchrotron experiments revealed that the high brilliance synchrotron beam might have had some influence on the morphology evolution. The width of the region sampled by the beam was estimated to be 150 µm. The morphology of the film within the area of the beam interaction with the sample differed markedly from the morphology far from the beam interaction area as could be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>. c</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) GIXD rocking curve of (220) PbS on GaAs(100) deposited at 30°C for 30-180 min.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The topography of the film surface within the beam interaction area seems to be much rougher than that far from the beam interaction area, and that there is big amount of disoriented aggregates at the outskirts of the beam-sample interaction region (marked as "beam edge" in Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). In addition some scrapings were observed <ref type="bibr">(Fig 3a)</ref>. A magnified view of the "beam edge" region is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>. SEM micrograph of the film surface far from the beam interaction area revealed a typical &lt;110&gt; oriented monocrystalline topography as shown in Fig <ref type="figure">3c</ref>. This is in fact not surprising since the deposition conditions were optimized in-house (in the absence of a high brilliance x-ray beam), while the in-situ experiments were strongly perturbed by the energy provided by the high brilliance x-ray beam at ID-01. This suggests that lower deposition temperatures should be used in future in-situ synchrotron experiments in order to work closer to optimal deposition conditions.</p></div>			</div>
