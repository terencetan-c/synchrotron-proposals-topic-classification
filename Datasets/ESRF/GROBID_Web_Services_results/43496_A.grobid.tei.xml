<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Diffuse scattering from GP-zones in the Al-Zn-Mg alloy system</p><p>Experiment number: 01-02-898 Beamline: BM01A Date of experiment: from: 17-07-2010 to: 20-07-2010 Date of report: 10-11-2010 Shifts: 9 Local contact(s): Philip Pattison Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): M.Sc Ingunn Cecilie Oddsen, University of Stavanger, Norway Prof. Vidar Hansen, University of Stavanger, Norway Report:</p><p>Data was collected from 7 crystals, from a total of 5 differently heat treated Al-Zn-Mg samples, all containing 5.4 wt% Zn and 1.2 wt% Mg. The aim was to characterise the diffuse scattering in reciprocal space from the GP-zones formed during the heat treatment sequence:</p><p>Supersaturated solid solution → GP-zones →η' →η (MgZn2)</p><p>Crystal 1 had been solution heat treated at 430 o C followed by aging at 100 o C for 3 hours. A quick CCD ω scan from -108 o to 108 o with 1 o , 1 s per frame, resulting in 216 frames, was done. The quality of this crystal was not particularly good, looked like a single crystal with much tension in, so no more data was recorded from it.</p><p>Crystal 2 had been solution heat treated at 430 o C followed by aging at 100 o C for 5 hours. A quick CCD ω scan from -108 o to 108 o with 1 o , 1 s per frame was done, giving 216 frames. The Al reflexes were also for this crystal extended, and nothing more was done with this crystal.</p><p>Crystal 3 was taken from the same sample as crystal 2, but was of much better quality. In addition to the standard quick ω scan, it was also collected a long ω scan with 1s, 0.5 o giving 432 frames of CCD images. After this an IP 360 o 0.5 o φ scan was collected over night, resulting in 601 frames before it was stopped. The MAR detector images contain less noise than CCD images, which is favourable when detecting this weak diffuse scattering. To further improve the image quality, cryogenic gas was used to reduce the thermal contribution, and a new dataset of 180 frames was recorded at 100 K.</p><p>Crystal 4 had been solution heat treated at 480 o C followed by aging at 100 o C for 3 hours. An IP 360 o 0.5 o φ scan at 100 K was collected, resulting in 662 frames.</p><p>Short IP 1 o φ scan at 100 K was recorded from crystal 5 and crystal 6, both taken from a sample solution heat treated at 480 o C followed by aging for 5 hours at 100 o C. They were not particularly good, so 48 and 109 frames were recorded respectively. At least this will be enough data to see reflexes from the GP(II) zones.</p><p>All of the remaining time was spent collecting data from crystal 7, that had been left to age harden at room temperature, and thereby represents a state in the very beginning of the precipitation sequence. An IP 0.5 o φ scan at 100 K was recorded, giving 351 frames.</p><p>A background image from the air scattering without sample mounted was also recorded. This background is the same for all the recorded MAR data images and has been subtracted from all the raw data in CrysAlis. Reconstructions of reciprocal space in the different directions have been done, giving the foundation needed to continue with appropriate image processing preparing the data for calculation of the 3D pair correlation function. Chimera will also be used for the 3D visualisation. This will form the basis of further analysis. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
