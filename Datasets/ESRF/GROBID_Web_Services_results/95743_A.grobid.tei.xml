<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The travel times of seismic waves through Earth's interior provide one of the few direct constraints on the physical properties of mantle rocks. If carefully compared with experimental and computational measurements of the elastic properties of minerals this data may be interpreted in terms of mantle mineralogy, chemistry and temperature; information that is not otherwise directly attainable. Over several decades our knowledge of Earth's seismic structure has developed from simple 1-D velocity models, constructed from stacked seismograms <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dziewonski and Anderson 1981)</ref>, into full 3-D tomographic models of Earth's velocity structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ritsema et al. 2011)</ref>. In order to accurately interpret this vast array of high quality data it is absolutely vital there are high quality measurements of the elastic properties of the main Earth forming minerals. At the present time, using currently available mineralogical databases the seismic velocities of the transition zone appear inconsistent with a pyrolytic or piglogitic bulk composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Irifune et al., 2008)</ref>, suggesting either that the velocities of the consituent minerals need to be better constrained our our planet's mantle composition differs from the current consensus.</p><p>After olivine and its high-pressure polymorphs, garnet is the second most abundant mineral in peridotite and is modally dominant in subducted eclogitic oceanic crust throughout the upper mantle <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Holland et al., 2013)</ref>. Whilst low-pressure garnets (&lt; 6 GPa) almost exclusively follow an A 2+ 3B 3+ 2Si3O12 stoichiometry, at greater depths the number of silicon cations in equilibrium garnets increases beyond 3 due to 2 substitution mechanisms:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">2B 3+ = M 2+ + Si 4+ (1 -Mj substitution) B 3+ + M 2+ = X + + Si 4+ (2 -NaMj substitution)</formula><p>Both substitutions are pressure dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akaogi et al., 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Dymshits et al., 2013)</ref> and result in final products of (1) MgSiO3 majorite or (2) Na2MgSi5O12 Na-majorite garnet. In natural systems Mj and NaMj components account for up to ~ 80 mol.% of garnet's chemistry as reflected by the reported suite of ~ 220 majoritic garnets observed as inclusions within sub-lithospheric diamonds. Thus, Mj and NaMj components can contribute very significantly to the geophysical properties of garnet throughout the Earth's upper mantle. However, there are currently very few published constraints (experimental and/or computational) on the seismic velocities of these two majoritic garnet endmembers. Thus, it is feasible that the properties of these garnets may explain the discrepancies between observed mantle velocities and those predicted using mineralogical models.</p><p>Both of the high-pressure majoritic endmembers (Mj and NaMj) adopt a tetragonal crystal symmetry when recovered to ambient conditions (I41/a or I41/acd). However, there is published evidence based on microstructural observations of recovered Mj samples that MgSiO3 may undergo a second order tetragonal to cubic (Ia3 ̅ d) transition at mantle conditions <ref type="bibr">(~ 18 GPa, &gt; 2000</ref><ref type="bibr">K, Heinemann et al., 1997)</ref>. There has been no previous study to investigate the NaMj endmember in this way. This experiment was the beginning of our project to study the crystallography and seismic velocities of Mj and NaMj at realistic mantle conditions.</p><p>ES-982 was performed in June 2021, via remote access only, due to the travel restrictions associated with COVID-19. Due to these circumstances the four experiments, which were constructed at UCL and shipped to the ESRF had to be loaded and interfaced with the beamline equipment by Dr Crichton, whom we are very grateful to for his assistance. This COVID-19 operation route signifcantly limited the finesse of instrument control, the ability to perform as many experiments as normally expected and the possibility of adapting the experimental protocol in response to observations from previous runs. Despite these difficulties we were successful in obtaining some results as detailed below (table 1).</p><p>Table 1: summary of experimental runs performed in es-982 experiment starting material Max PT conditions notes NaMj_1 NaMj garnet (10/4) 16 GPa, ~ 1000 K • new low background gaskets • good ultrasonic signal before heating • blow-out on initial heating NaMj_2 NaMj garnet (7/3) 17 GPa, 1600 K • made NaPx on initial heating (pressure loss) • pressurised to make NaMj • ultrasonics signal poor • observed cubictetragonal transition in NaMj on cooling • collected diffraction to 1 bar • ambient NaMj structure refined, tetragonal splitting significantly smaller than in Dymshits et al. (2013). More consitent with earlier studies. Mj_1 enstatite (10/4) 15 GPa, 1400 K • made clinoenstatite on initial heating (pressure loss) • compressed to try and reach akimotoite + ringwoodite field • the sample geometry changed to be unsuitable for ultrasonics Mj_2 enstatite (7/3) 18 GPa, 2200 K • synthesised akimotoite on intial heating • ultrasonics working • majorite-in at ~ 2000 K • annealing to achieve full sample transformation • massive blow-out before data collection could commence</p><p>Within the four experimental runs, two suffered catastrophic blow-outs. One (NaMj_1) was due to the failure of the low-background gaskets upon heating. The second (Mj_2) was during sample annealing at &gt; 2000 K. Mj_1 was also a failure as pressure loss upon initial heating for the majorite sample was far greater than expected, such that the conditions of the majorite stability field could not be reached by subsequent compression at high temperature.</p><p>The most successful experiment was NaMj_2, during which NaMj was successfully synthesised and crystallogrpahically studied as a function of temperature at ~ 15 GPa, and during room temperature decompression. Data collected upon cooling from ~ 1600K to room temperature revealed a phase transition in NaMj indicated by the discontinuous broadening of the peaks width with decreasing temperature (fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This is consistent with a second order phase transition from cubic to tetragonal NaMj. Unfortunately, the ultraosonic signal, which would have confirmed this observation was poor quality throughout this experiment. After collecting data at a range of high PT conditions, diffraction data was collected throughout decompression, revealing the size of tetragonal splitting increases with decreasing pressure towards the ambient sample properties. Full Rietveld refinement of the sample at the end of decompression yields cell parameters for I41/acd NaMj of a = 11.40764(70) Å, c = 11.40036(71) Å and V = 1483.58(13) Å 3 (fig <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This is an extremely high resolution diffraction pattern, revealing the a/c ratio at ambient conditions of 1.00064(1) and the unit cell volume is constrained to ± 0.009%. These results are quite inconsitent with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bindi et al. (2011)</ref>, but are consitent with earlier reported volumes of <ref type="bibr">Pacalo et al (1992)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hazen et al (1994)</ref>. All high PT data is of equally good quality and will provide an extremely good study of the PVT systematics of NaMj when combined with additional data.</p><p>To continue and complete our study we will request further beamtime. Based on the experience here we will additionally study samples of MjxPy1-x solid solution, with x &gt; 0.8. The reason for this decision is the the addition of small pyrope components expands the stability field of garnet to both lower pressure and temperature conditions (shrinking the fields of cpx and akimotoite stability that have to be transitted prior to data collection). Additionally, these compositions remain tetragonal at ambient conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Dymshits et al., 2013)</ref>, unlike those with greater pyrope contents, thus still allowing the possible investigation of the cubic-tetragonal transitions. Additionally, we will only emply smaller 7/3 cells, which experience smaller pressure losses on initial heating, which will hopefully avoid back-transformation of starting materials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: evolution of the normalised peak width (fwhm relative to 300K) of the 640 and 642 peaks of the NaMj sample as the temperature was reduced from 1600 to 300K.
