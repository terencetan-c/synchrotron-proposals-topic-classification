Report: Resume This work was presented in the International Symposium on Non-Oxide and New Optical Glasses, 1-5, July, 2012, Saint-Malo, France and is described in the following article: G. Monteiro, L. F. Santos, R. M. Almeida and F. D´Acapito, "Local structure around Er 3+ in GeO 2 -TeO 2 -Nb 2 O 5 -K 2 O glasses and glass-ceramics", Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, In Press, Corrected Proof, Available online 7 January 2013. Elsevier; <ref type="url" target="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2012.12.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2012.12.019</ref>. The purpose of this work was to study the local environment of erbium in Er 3+ -doped germanotellurite glasses and glass-ceramics in the (80-x) GeO 2 -xTeO 2 -10Nb 2 O 5 -10K 2 O system (x=0-80 mol%). The heat treatments were performed based on differential scanning calorimetry data. Several crystalline phases, including α-TeO 2 , δ-TeO 2 and GeO 2 (α-quartz), together with K[Nb 1/2 TeO 2/3 ]2O 4.8</p><p>, could be distinguished in the X-ray diffraction patterns. The 1.5 µm photoluminescence (PL) emission of Er 3+ (4I 13/2 →4I 15/2 ) has been studied in the glasses and glass-ceramics and the latter revealed a general increase in the bandwidth of the emission spectra, compared to the PL peak of the starting glass samples. Some heat treated compositions presented Stark splitting of the 4I 13/2 →4I 15/2 transition, indicating that the environment around the Er 3+ ions had changed from an amorphous matrix to a more ordered environment. Therefore, Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure spectroscopy measurements were performed in order to investigate the Er 3+ coordination shell before and after heat treatments. The glass compositions presented only one coordination shell around Er 3+ , composed of oxygen, while two coordination shells could be distinguished for the heat treated samples: a first oxygen coordination shell for all heat treated compositions and a mixed second nearest neighbor shell of Te and Er ions, for the Te-rich compositions (x=80 to 50), and of Ge and Er ions, for the Ge-rich compositions (x=10 and 20).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Conditions</head><p>EXAFS spectroscopy measurements were conducted at the X-ray absorption spectroscopy hutch of GILDA at the ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility). The heat treated glass samples were finely ground and homogeneously dispersed in cellulose thin pellets with 13 mm diameter. The spectra were collected in the range of 8160-9250 eV to observe the Er-LIII edge (8358 eV) in the fluorescence mode at liquid nitrogen temperature (77K). The signal was collected from a 13-element high-purity Ge detector. The EXAFS data were analyzed with the Ifeffit (version 1.2.11c) software package. First, with Athena GUI, the oscillating part χ(k) that contained the information on the local structure as a function of the photoelectron wave-vector k was extracted. This function was then analyzed with Artemis GUI, by fitting either in backtransformed space or in Fourier space the respective χ(k) or χ(R) function to a pre-defined crystallographic model (feff.dat file), in order to estimate the unknown parameters, the amplitude reduction factor (S 0 2 ), the mean square fluctuation of R (Debye-Waller factor, σ 2 ), the bond length in single scattering paths (R) and the number of neighbors (N).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The results from EXAFS measurements revealed a single coordination shell for all the glasses, which was attributed to the presence of oxygen atoms as first neighbours (Er-O) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1aError</ref>! Reference source not found.). The EXAFS spectra of the glasses also make it possible to conclude that no short range clustering of Er 3+ ions occurred in these glasses, given that no second coordination shell was observed. The fittings were performed considering an Er 2 O 3 standard crystalline phase (ICSD 27774). EXAFS was also obtained for the heat treated compositions and it was found that Erbium forms two distinct local environments: a first coordination shell is present for all compositions and a second coordination shell throughout the germanotellurite glass-ceramic system studied: attributed to Ge for low tellurite content samples or attributed to Te for samples with more than 50 mol % of TeO 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). As an example, Table <ref type="table">1</ref> presents the calculated coordination numbers, bond lengths and Debye Waller factors for the 8T0G+2ErO 1.5 HT@546 o C sample by fitting the EXAFS χ(k) signal to the Er 2 Te 5 O 13 crystalline structural data (ICSD 413666).</p></div>
