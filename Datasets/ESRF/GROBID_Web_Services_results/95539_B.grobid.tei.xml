<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the beamtime was to study with XMCD the high pressure phases of the triplet superconductor UTe2. First we have investigated the magnetism of UTe2 at ambient pressure by performing XMCD, and in a second time, we have performed high pressure XANES measurments at 2.7 K. Due to a technical problem with the 8 T superconducting magnet, we could not investigate the magnetic part under pressure as described in the proposal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) XANES and XMCD at the U-M4,5 edges at ambient pressure</head><p>The XANES and XMCD spectra recorded at 2.7 K in an applied fiel of 17 T are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The branching ratio determined as B = IM5/ (IM5+IM4) where IM5 and IM4 are the integrated areas of the white lines at the M5 and M4 edges, respectively is found to be 0.706(2). Its value lies between those of the U 3+ (0.729) and U 4+ U free ion values. Thus, the U ions are in a intermediate valence state as expected from band structure calculations where the 5f count was found to be close to 2.8. Taking this value and using the spin orbit sum rule, we may evaluate the number of electron in the individual shells corresponding to j = 7/2 and j = 5/2, i.e., 0.28 and 2.52, respectively. The XMCD spectrum was recorded at 17 T with H applied along the a easy axis. A large signal has been detected at both M5,4-edges under 17T. Using the orbital magneto-optical sum rule, we estimated the 5f orbital (μL) and spin (μS) moments assuming that the 5f count is equal to 2.8, 3 and 2 and taking theoretical values for the &lt;TZ&gt;/&lt;SZ&gt; ratios (&lt;SZ&gt; and &lt;TZ&gt; are the z-components of the spin and magnetic dipole operators, respectively). It was concluded that the 5f 2 (U 4+ ) configuration led to unphysical results and that the actual 5f count is close to 2.8. The final results of our analysis are : μL = 1.61 μB , μS = -0.76 μB and -μL/ μS = 2.12. The orbital to spin moment ratio falling below the free ion U 3+ value (2.60) indicates significant delocalization of the 5f electrons due to the hybrization with the Te spd bands. Furthermore it was shown, by recording the maximum of the XMCD signal at the M4 edge, that the U magnetization matches well with the macroscopic magnetization.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> XANES and XMCD spectra at the U-M4,5 edges for UTe2 at 2.7 K and applied along the easy axis a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) XANES and XMCD at the Te-L1,2,3 edges at ambient pressure</head><p>The XMCD signal at the Te-L1 edge is only due to the orbital polarization of the 5p Te unoccupied states through hybridization with the U spin-orbit split states. The integration of the negative and positive peaks led to an overall negative signal which indicates a positive 5p orbital moment whose magnitude is difficult to estimate. No information is provided for the 5p spin moment. The XMCD signal at the Te-L2,3 edges is minute because the small number of holes inside the 4d band. The total 4d moment is tentatively estimated to amount about + 0.001μB. To conclude the Te 5p moment should be the main contribution to the Te moment, in agrrement with ARPES and bnd structure calculations of the partial densities of states.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) High pressure XANES at the U-M4,5 edges</head><p>So far the high pressure (HP) data were limited to XANES. The 8 T superconducting cryomagnet forseen for the XMCD experiments was sent for repair to Oxford Instruments. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows selected data for the pressure dependence of the M5 white line. It indicates that the number of holes in the 5f shell first increases while it decreases at the highest pressure. Thus, the U valence first increases towards U 4+ then decreases. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig.2.
