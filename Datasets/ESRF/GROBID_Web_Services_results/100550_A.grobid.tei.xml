Cottrez's thesis, was to lead to a detailed description of the multi-scale structure of hydrotreatment catalysts, based on molybdenum sulfide supported on alumina, and synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). These results will complete the ones obtained during the previous A02-01-901 experiment about the influence of the synthesis parameters onto the multiscale sulfide slabs arrangement and currently going under publication <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Here, the impact of the support or metallic precursors, or the number of successive impregnations have been investigated. Also, the influence of the support heterogeneities has been investigated by ASAXS spatially resolved as it could lead to different Mo organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and preliminary conclusions of the study:</head><p>62 oxide or sulfide catalysts were analyzed, varying: the loading of molybdenum oxide (from 18 to 30% wt), the textural properties of the support (A, B and C), the nature of oxidic precursors, or the number of successive IWI. ASAXS experimentations were recorded slightly below the Mo K-edge, at 5 different energies <ref type="bibr">Ei, respectively: 19700, 19860, 19940, 19975, 19990</ref> eV. As we wanted the largest q-domain as possible (typically between 10 -2 and 1 A -1 ), two detector/sample distances were used (3579 and 332 cm). Also, 6 catalysts sections (around 100µm thick) from the previous A02-01-901 experiment have been characterized by ASAXS spatially resolved with pixel resolution of 40 µm x 40 µm. ASAXS experimentations were recorded only for E1, E3 and E5 for a unique and optimized detector/sample distance at 811 mm. Information obtained from the ASAXS data can be divided into two parts through the q-scale [1,2]: (i) the large q that are related to the scale of the slabs: the intensity depends on the size of the slabs and on their stacking, (ii) the low q that are related to the slabs aggregates. The comparison of the ASAXS curves already give qualitative information but preliminary data exploitations have also been done for the last months, however this work is underway and must continue. Few examples are presented below.</p><p>-Effect of support: Series of catalysts have been prepared using three different supports with mono (A and B) or bi-populated (C) populations of interconnected pores. The ASAXS curves obtained for the 26 %wt MoO3 catalysts are reported on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. It appears that porosity has a direct impact on the slabs aggregates morphologies as the catalyst prepared on support C has a curve totally different from the two others at the smaller q values. Moreover, the aggregate content has been estimated from the modelling of the curves, which allowed to underline (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) the influence of the support on the aggregation state, and thus on the catalytic activity. -Effect of the support heterogeneities: Positions of areas of interest of a 26 %wt MoO3/A catalyst aged and dried have been surveyed upstream by MEB as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>. Thus, SAXS spatially resolved has been carried out and shows qualitative differences within the extrudates. Four areas of interests have been raised by MEB: the center and edges of extrudates, and the matrix and macroscopic grains of the support. ASAXS curves extracted from four pixels from these areas demonstrates that there are less Mo aggregates at the edges than in the center, and a completely different Mo arrangement in the macroscopic grains. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments about the use of beam time:</head><p>For the capillary measurements, 2 shifts were dedicated to the setup of the beamline, one at each detector/sample distance, and 2 shifts for each distance were necessary to record the data (6 shifts in total). For the last session, 9 shifts were finally used, to set up the beamline, the acquisition conditions and to perform the spatially resolved measurements.</p></div>
