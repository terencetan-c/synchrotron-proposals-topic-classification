<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main aim of the experiments was to elucidate the oxidation states of Cu in CuCl 2 -MCl/-Al 2 O 3 , CuCl 2 /-Al 2 O 3 , and CuCl 2 /UiO-66 catalysts during the oxychlorination reaction. The following objectives were set:</p><p>1. Observing the Cu(II)/Cu(I) ratio during reaction at different temperatures with respect to the dopant added, with fixed M/Cu ratio (M = K, La or Mg). 2. Effect of K/Cu ratio on the Cu(II)/Cu(I) ratio, as well as on the formation of K-Cu mixed compounds. 3. Effect of a different support for the oxychlorination reaction, here: " UiO-66" was used.</p><p>Experimental: A XAS study in transmission mode at Cu K-edge (8979 eV) was performed, with XRD as complimentary technique. The catalyst was loaded into a capillary, which was coupled to a gas feed system and a mass spectrometer (MS) for detection of feed and effluent gas composition. The gas stream passed through a water bath and was then further diluted with Ar before reaching the MS, in order for the HCl concentration to go below 2 %. The in-situ set up is showed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>The experimental procedure was as follows:</p><p>1. XRD and quick XANES spectra of the fresh catalyst were aquired at room temperature.  Results: XANES spectra for 3.1wt% KCl loaded onto 5wt% CuCl 2 /-Al 2 O 3 (K3.1Cu5.0) are reported in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the spectra measured during heating under He, while Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows spectra aquired under reaction conditions at 230C. Comparison to reference spectra aquired for CuCl and CuCl 2 , respectively, show that the sample remained in the Cu 2+ oxidation state during heating (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). However, upon introduction of the reaction mixture at 230C, Cu 2+ was gradually reduced to Cu + (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). The information achieved by XANES data as exemplified in Figures 2-3, i.e. the relative fraction of Cu(II) and Cu(I) at different reaction temperatures, is vital for understanding the shift of rate determining step for different variants of CuCl x catalysts. Another important information gained by this study (EXAFS spectra) was the disappearance of the Cu phase upon prolonged heating in all but the K-doped samples. Previous studies have indicated the formation of a mixed K-Cu-Cl phase, and work is currently in progress in the home lab to synthesise the mixed compound and test it as catalyst for the ethene oxychlorination reaction. MS spectra aquired during testing showed that the residence time in the capillary cell was too short to allow appreciable conversion of ethene, and this should be improved in future experiments at ESRF by applying a cell with a larger reaction volume.</p><p>Finally, XANES spectra were aquired during heating, testing and cooling of a Metal-Organic Framework compound (MOF) with UiO-66 structure and CuCl 2 loading (Cu-MOF). Interestingly, the data obtained indicate that Cu 2+ was reduced to Cu + upon introduction of the reaction mixture (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). XRD data (not shown) suggested that the material was unstable in the HCl-containing reaction mixture. However, the observation of accessible Cu species in the material bears promise that this material can be applied as catalyst for other reactions in a less corrosive environment.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>2. The catalyst was heated to 230 ºC (dT = 10ºC/min) under He flow (35 ml/min). Quick XANES scans (2 minutes) were measured untill the temperature reached 230 ºC. Thereafter, EXAFS scans (2x 40 mins) were aquired. 3. The gas feed was switched to the reaction mixture (C 2 H 4 : HCl : Air : He = 56 : 20 : 23.8 : 60.2 Nml/min, T = 230 ºC. 56 Nml/min Ar was added after the reactor.). The majority of gas flow was fed in by-pass (due to too large mass flow controller capacity compared to the capillary size), while the maximum total flow through the capillary was 5-8 Nml/min. XANES scans (1 minute scans) were performed untill a stable Cu(II)/Cu(I) ratio was observed. Then EXAFS scans (2 x 40 min) were aquired. 4. The temperature was ramped up to 280ºC (dT = 10 ºC/min) while aquiring quick XANES spectra.When the temperature was stable at 280ºC, long EXAFS scans (2 x 40 min) and XRD was performed. 5. The temperature was reduced to 230ºC. When the temperature was stable, 2 quick XANES scans and 2x 40 min EXAFS scans were acquired.</figDesc></figure>
