<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Van der Waals heterostructures based on 2D polymers </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposal Objective</head><p>In this proposal, we studied the precise structure of novel van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) using different 2D materials like 2D polymers (2DPs), metal organic frameworks (MOFs), graphene or transition metal dichalcogenide. Although we have recently shown that the synthesis of 2D polyimide-graphene (2DPI-G) vdWHs at the liquid-air interface is possible there is still a lot to learn about the formation and precise structure of this novel class of material system and the combination of 2D materials in heterostructures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>This was the first time that we measured with this setup at ID10, so the first task in analysing the data was to convert it into a format that can be imported into our visualisation and analysis software WxDiff. We were able to convert the data in binary image files including a calibration file that could now be analyzed.</p><p>In the course of our experiment we studied a variety of individual films and heterostructures (including 2DPs, 2D MOFs, MoS2 and graphene) that have been prepared either at the water surface or via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In addition to the fabrication method the deposition conditions have also been varied.</p><p>Here, we will focus on vdWHs made from MoS2 and the 2D MOF Cu-BHT [copper(II) benzenehexathiolate] prepared under different conditions. Specifically, different types of MoS2 were first fabricated by CVD at different temperatures and then thin films of Cu-BHT (around 20 nm) were grown on top of these MoS2 layers by a second CVD step. As an example, we show the 2D GIWAXS images of a heterostructure of individual MoS2 crystals with the Cu-BHT film grown on it (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>) and one with a large are MoS2 film and Cu-BHT deposited with the same growth conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>). Both samples show diffraction rings as well as spots with the sample with the MoS2 crystals showing stronger intensities. The diffraction spots are clear signatures of MoS2 in the form of a Bragg rod at around Qxy = 2.3 Å -1 . The actual position of the peaks varies slightly between the two samples resulting in different unit cells. We calculated the following cell for the sample with smaller MoS2 crystals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>): a = b = 2.75 Å, c = 6.28 Å, α = 75.37°, β = 83.66° and γ = 97.38°. For the sample with the large area MoS2 film (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>) we determined the following lattice: a = b = 3.20 Å, c = 6.43 Å, α = 75.52°, β = 89.73° and γ = 120.50°. We also extracted possible unit cells of the Cu-BHT grown on top but here it needs to be mentioned that due to the limited number of diffraction rings for the sample with the MoS2 film there is certain uncertainty in the unit cell meaning that there are other similar cells that could explain the diffraction pattern. We assume the unit cell to be monoclinic based on previous literature reports (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201707568) and the lattice for the film on the small MoS2 crystals was calculated to be: a = 10.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook</head><p>Further analysis of the collected data is currently ongoing for a variety of individual layers as well as heterostructures of various of these. The analysis will include indexing of the observed peaks and calculating the unit cells of the different crystalline films. We expect to be able to publish some of the data as part of scientific manuscript in high-impact journals. Furthermore, we are planning to submit new proposals for ID10 due to the very promising results of the experiment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Stefan Mannsfeld, Technische Universität Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany Dr. Mike Hambsch, Technische Universität Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany* Mr. Jonathan Perez, Technische Universität Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany* Ms. Shaoling Bai, Technische Universität Dresden, 01069 Dresden, Germany* Report:</figDesc></figure>
