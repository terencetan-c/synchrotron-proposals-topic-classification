<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The protein crystallography laboratory at the University of Tromsø has been regular user of ESRF for many years. Over the years this has resulted in more than 40 publications and a considerable number of PhDs and MScs. The Norwegian Structural Biology Centre (NORSTRUCT) is administrated by the Department of Chemistry at the University of Tromsø, and was established in 2002 through a national initiative in functional genomics in Norway. The aim of this initiative is the establishment of a structural biology centre of high international standard for determination and analysis of the 3D-structures of biologically active macromolecules. In addition to taking part in projects nationwide as an external collaborator, NORSTRUCT has been given the opportunity to initiate and develop internal projects at the centre. Our involvement in external projects range from consultancy to full scale structure determination and structure-function analysis, including hosting project workers for training and providing access to facilities.</p><p>Internal projects at NORSTRUCT focus on proteins expressed by the fish pathogenic bacteria Vibrio salmonicida and enzymes involved in the defence systems of Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon, and with a structural genomics approach to virulence factors and defence molecules of the model organisms. "Structural genomics studies of Vibrio salmonicida", is one part of a more comprehensive project on this psychrophilic and pathogenic bacteria, also including genome sequencing and cellular/functional studies. The structural part of the project is divided into sub-groups based on functional aspects of the proteins. A) "Structurefunction relation studies of proteins involved in oxidative stress", B) "Structure-function relation studies of nucleases", C) "Structure-function studies of DNA repair proteins", D) "Structure-function studies of hypothetical proteins", and E) "Structure determination of virulence factors expressed by V. salmonicida". External projects originate both in the academic society in Norway and in the biotecnology industry, and include nucleases and DNA binding proteins, phosphatases, isocitrate dehydrogenases and several other proteins of academic and commercial interest. The majority of the projects are the subject of structure-function-relation studies, where one seeks to increase the the knowledge about the relationship between structure and biophysical properties such as specificity, efficiency and stability. Succeding structure determination several of the proteins will be the target of redesign of one or more such properties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure studies of DNase from shrimp</head><p>Recombinant Dnase from shrimp is produced in Pichia Pastoris. New crystals of DNase had been obtained using seding techniques from 14 -16% PEG 6K, 2 mM WO 4 2-and 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 5. The crystals had the same morphology as previous experiments, but the edges were "sharper". The thin plates diffracted to ca 2.4 Å. The crystals were indexed to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with cell parameters of 49.17 x 51.37 x 177.02 mm 3 . Data was collected on the W L-III edge at the peak with the aim of SAD phasing. The anomalous signal was, unfortunately, very weak and probably not good enough for phasing. R sym was 11.7%, I/σI was 4.3, completeness and anomalous completeness were 99.9% and multiplicity 6.8.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure studies of proteins involved in copper homeostasis</head><p>New crystals of MopE had been obtained from two different conditions: a) ca 2M ammoniumsulfate and 0.1M Tris pH 7.5 and b) 20% PEG 4K and 0.1M Citrate buffer at pH 5.5. Both conditions give crystals belonging to space group C2, but the cell parameters are different. The crystal crown from ammoniumsulfate diffracted to 2.1 Å. Cell parameters were 104.35 x 101.63 x 38.68 mm 3 and β=101.81, R sym ca 7%, I/σI ca 6.6, completeness and anomalous completeness 100% and multiplicity ca 5.2. The crystal grown from PEG diffracted to 2.5 Å and cell parameters were 66.56 x 100.90 x 54.92 mm 3 and β=99.15, R sym ca 11%, I/σI ca 5.6, completeness and anomalous completeness 99.9% and multiplicity ca 9.9. These data are still being tried for phasing.</p><p>Structure studies of three glycosylated proteins from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) Analysis of the crystals in polarized light suggest that some crystals of this protein are not single crystals. The crystals monted for this experiment had all been checked for this. Unfortunately, the best diffracting crystals diffracted only to ca 3.5 Å and no complete dataset were collected.</p></div>		</body>
