However, since most hydrogels contain a large amount of the water, their mechanical properties are often inferior to other traditional polymeric materials, which unavoidably limit their applicabilities in the field like tissue engineering. One way to circumvent this problem is to use DN systems, which significantly improve the mechanical performance of these hydrogels. Since the invention of DN in 2003, several DN systems has been designed and tested, however, majority of them either has rather lower biocompatibility or is completely based on natural polymers which is difficult to be modified. Hence it is necessary to design a new synthetic DN with modifiable chemical properties. In this study, a novel polypeptide-based bio-compatible DN hydrogels with enhanced toughness. The first network is based on a polypeptide (PP) synthesized from NCA polymerization. Through modifying the Glu units in this polypeptide and using alkyne-azide click chemistry to crosslink the system, a transparent polypeptide single network gel was generated. After sufficient dialysis to remove the copper catalyst, the whole network was immersed into a modified di-acrylate solution mixed with photo initiator, after the gel was fully swollen inside this solution, the whole system was exposed to UV light to form the second network (PA).</p><p>The DN network shows several promising properties in relation to its tissue engineering application. The great cell biocompatibility can be found even after 1-week-long cell exposure, while the strength of DN is around 1.5 times the SN from the preliminary mechanical analyses.</p><p>Due to the difficulty on adjusting the samples size to fit into the shearing cell, two measurements were carried out. One is SAXS analyses of DN in its swollen state over time. In this case, the sample was cut into small pieces and put into a 2mm capillary filled with water. As shown in Figue 1, a clear shifting of the seond domain size can be observed toward to smaller value, which is the direct resutl of polymer chain stretching in PP netwok. The second test is ex-situ shearing test. The swelling sample underwent a constant shearing for 5mins, and then mounted on a sample stage and tested. As shown in Figure 2 The whole experiment helps us to further advance our knowledge on the impact of swelling and individual network ratio on the DN domain distributions, and the manuscript is under preparation currently.</p><p>0.1 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 I(q) q (nm -1 ) 3 min 6 min 9 min 12 min 15 min 18 min 21 min 24 min 27 min</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: SAXS profile of double network (M(PP):M(PA)=1:2) after swelling in water solution over time.</figDesc></figure>
