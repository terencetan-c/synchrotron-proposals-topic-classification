<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why two beam lines?</head><p>This report, concerning the approved proposal CH-2533, encompasses the experiments performed at two distinct beam lines at the ESRF: BM01a and ID31. A total of 12 shifts (6 + 6) were given to the submitted proposals. We note at this stage that the collected data sets were highly complementary, particularly concerning the studies on the Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), hence the reason why a global report encompassing all the results was done.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The inclusion compound TRIMEB![Ru([9]aneS 3 )phenCl]Cl was the subject of data collection at both BM01a and ID31 with the final objective of gathering a pattern with a good signal-to-noise ratio which, eventually, could lead to more detailed investigations. At the BM01a beam line two-dimensional patterns were collected using a MAR image plate (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> top). Despite the excellent signal-to-noise ratio, the convolution of the reflection lines avoided an unequivocal unit cell indexation. Also, the use of typical unit cell parameters for TRIMEB inclusion compounds did not produce reasonable full pattern decompositions. Line resolution was achieved at the ID31 beam line (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> bottom), which unequivocally confirmed the presence of more than one crystalline phase. The collected results permitted, however, preliminary global optimization studies in direct space using FOX, leading to a structural model of the supramolecular adduct. This model was found to be very similar to that found for the inclusion compound DIMEB•CpMo(H 2 biim)(CO) 2 •BF 4 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> However, the strongest reflections (at high angle) could not be fully accounted, thus suggesting that most likely a dense material was also co-crystallizing. In short, these results yielded a possible structural model for the inclusion compound TRIMEB![Ru([9]aneS 3 )phenCl]Cl, which was found to exhibit an interesting inhibitory action on the growth of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains. These results were published in the specialized journal Biometals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Corrole Derivatives</head><p>A very small single-crystal of the gallium(III)(pyridine) complex of 3-[3,4-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-1methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyrrol-2-yl]-5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole was studied at the Swiss-Norwegian Beam Line BM01a using conventional synchrotron optics, a MAR345 Research imaging plate and a fixed monochromated wavelength of " = 0.7173 Å. A full data set was collected at low temperature (100K) which allowed the unequivocal structural elucidation of the compound in the the I2/a space group. At this temperature the asymmetric unit of the compound was found to be composed of two identical, but crystallographically independent, molecular units with one of them being represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> for illustrative purposes. Nevertheless, the corrole cores of the two molecular units are almost identical as depicted in the structure overlay provided in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. These results were published in Journal of Porphyrins and Phthalacyanines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metal-Organic Frameworks</head><p>A new family of photoluminescent layered materials, ultimately formulated as [Ln(H 2 cmp)]!xH 2 O [where H 5 cmp stands for (carboxymethyl)iminodi(methylphosphonic acid) and x &lt; 1; Ln 3+ = Nd 3+ and Eu 3+ ], were systematically isolated as microcrystalline powders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> A full structural elucidation from powder X-ray diffraction could only be achieved by using powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction data. First, the highresolution diffractometer installed at the Swiss-Norwegian beam line was used to collect a high signal-tonoise ratio pattern for ab initio crystal solution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). In parallel, to unequivocally find the systematic absences a further high signal-to-noise powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction pattern was then collected at 298K at the BM01a station (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). The combination of these two data sets (from the two stations) allowed a full elucidation of the structural details of the [Nd(H 2 cmp)]!0.75H 2 O material. These results permitted the study of the photoluminescent properties of isotypical Eu 3+ compounds, with all the information being published in a special issue of the international journals Zeitschrift Fur Kristallographie. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>   The hydrothermal reaction of rare-earth (RE) chloride salts with N-(carboxymethyl)iminodi(methylphosphonic acid) (H 5 cmp) led to the isolation of a series of layered networks formulated as <ref type="bibr">3+</ref> , Pr 3+ , Nd 3+ , Sm 3+ , Eu 3+ , Gd 3+ , Tb 3+ , Dy 3+ , Ho 3+ and Er 3+ ]. All compounds were usually obtained as micro-crystalline powders. Full structural elucidation was attained by the combination of synchrotron radiation (micro-crystal and powder diffraction data). <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> In a first stage, very thin fragments of [La(H 2 cmp)(H 2 O)] were were inspected under the synchrotron radiation beam at the BM01a beamline until the collected diffraction patterns resembled that of a typical single-crystal and for which the collected frames could also be unequivocally indexed. A complete microcrystal data set was collected at 100(2) K for the best diffracting crystal, and the crystal structure solved though with very poor R-factors.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[RE(H 2 cmp)(H 2 O)] [RE 3+ = Y 3+ , La</formula><p>Powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns with a high signal-to-noise ratio for several bulk materials were collected at ambient temperature (298K) at the multi-purpose powder station assembled at the BM01a beam line. Rietveld structural refinements using as starting premise the atomic coordinates of the single-crystal structural model were performed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</p><p>The compound consists of # 2 [La(H 2 cmp)(H 2 O] layers in the ab plane of the unit cell, constructed from a single La 3+ centre (in a highly distorted dodecahedral coordination environment with one water molecule in the first coordination sphere) and one H 2 cmp 3-ligand present in a zwiterionic form. Connections between layers along the c-axis are assured by strong and highly directional O-H!!!O hydrogen bonds involving the protonated phosphonate group (donor) of one layer and one oxygen atom (acceptor) of the carboxylate group in the adjacent layer. We note that the same structural features have been observed for the remaining members of the series. The structural details and catalytic and optical properties of these materials have been published in Journal of Materials Chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
