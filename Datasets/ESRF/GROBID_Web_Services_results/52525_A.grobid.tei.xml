<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context of the experiment</head><p>In case of an accidental nuclear event, contamination of humans by actinide elements may occur. Such elements have the particularity to exhibit both a radiological and chemical toxicity that may induce severe damages at several levels depending on the biokinetics of the element. In order to eliminate the actinide elements before they are stored in target organs (depending on the element: liver, kidneys, bone), sequestering agents must be quickly injected. However to date, there is still no ideal sequestering agent, despite the recent interests in contamination concerns. This project aims to better understand the interaction of actinide elements with two types of molecules that are currently inspiring future sequestering agents : DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) and the LIHOPO (hydroxypyridonate) family. Note that DTPA is currently the only available treatment in case of accidental contamination. The SRI company is for instance developing a new formulation of this chemical (Ca-DTPA) for the treatment of internal contamination with plutonium, americium, and curium caused by exposure to a radiological dispersal device or improvised nuclear device.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental results</head><p>In this experiment we have investigated the structure of Th(IV), Pu(IV) and {U(VI)O 2 2+ } complexes with DTPA and 3,4,3LI-(1,2-HOPO) in aqueous solution.</p><p>1/ the hydroxypyridonate family Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1ab</ref> shows as an example the EXAFS spectrum of the {U(VI)O 2 2+ }-LI-HOPO complex together with a schematic structure of the complex (fitting data provided in the legend). In this complex, the uranyl coordination plane is fulfilled by 4 of the LI-HOPO hydroxamine and carbonyl chelating functions. IR spectroscopy has confirmed this assignment. We have also verified that the complex at pH = 2 (at this pH any uranium hydrolysis is avoided) and at pH closer to physiological conditions (5 -6) are identical. Furthermore, the stoichiometry of the complex (1:2) has been determined using size exclusion chromatography coupled to UV-Vis. The complex formula is therefore assumed to be [(UO 2 ) 2 LI-HOPO(NO 3 ) 2 ] 2+ . The Th(IV) and Np(IV) adducts have also been prepared and are now compared to the very different {U(VI)O 2 2+ } adduct. In parallel, competitions between LI-HOPO and Fetuine (Fet, a protein with high uranyl affinity involved in bone turnover) has been investigated by size exclusion chromatography. The occurrence of a ternary complex {U(VI)O 2 2+ }-LI-HOPO-Fet has been identified. Characterization of the modification of the uranyl coordination sphere with EXAFS in presence of Fet is in progress but difficulties come from the necessity to subtract the pure {U(VI)O 2 2+ }-LI-HOPO signal. This is currently being carried out.   As a continuation, the group is currently investigating supramolecular sequestering agents based on DTPA grafted on nanoparticles. 2 L. Bonin, D.

Aminocarboxylate ligands (NTA, EDTA, DTPA) exhibit a double coordination mode : the oxygen of the carboxylate function in the first coordination sphere and the nitrogen of the tertiary amine function in the second coordination sphere. This has been observed on the NTA ligand. 2 Similar trend has been observed with DTPA although this double coordination mode must be taken with much care because of the similarity from the EXAFS point of view between the oxygen and nitrogen backscatters. The fitted distances are summarized in Figure 2a. In parallel, molecular dynamics simulations have been able to define the radial distribution functions for the [PuDTPA] -1 complex for Pu-O, Pu-N and Pu-C. The trend observed by EXAFS is reproduced with an average Pu-O distance equal to 2.29 Å and Pu-N distance equal to 2.73 Å.
