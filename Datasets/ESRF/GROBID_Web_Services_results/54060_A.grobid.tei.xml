<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>of approach</head><p>The goal of project ES171 was to identify the mineral phases responsible for burial of phosphorus (P) in lowoxygen marine sediments, using a combination of micro XRF mapping and micro XANES. We gathered data at the P, Fe and Mn K-edges. ES171 was a continuation of ES45 (carried out at ID21 in April 2013).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Resin-embedded sediment samples from two marine systems (the Baltic Sea and the Bothnian Sea) were prepared in advance of the visit to ID21 by anoxic epoxy-resin embedding. Pre-mapping was performed on a desktop Orbis micro XRF at Utrecht. The samples were also pre-drilled with a grid of holes which were visible under the video microscope at ID21. Several samples from each location were analysed at ID21, including a series of samples from increasing sediment depth at a site in the Bothnian Sea. Initially, micro XRF maps were made of the samples of interest using a focused beam at 7.2 keV. Co-incident enrichments of Fe, Mn and P were identified for micro XANES and EXAFS analyses. The experiment was started with XRF mapping above the Fe K-edge and Fe and Mn Kedge XAS analyses, before shifting the energy to the P K-edge and returning to the same enrichments to collect P K-edge XANES.</p><p>A series of phosphate mineral standards, and additional Fe and Mn-contaning materials, were prepared and analyzed at the relevant edges by XANES. Additionally, a number of P-EXAFS spectra were collected on both samples and standards materials, to test the feasibility of this technique for future work. All XAS analyses were performed in fluorescence mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>XANES spectra of the standard materials show distinct fingerprints at the P, Fe and Mn K-edges (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which were subsequently used for the linear combination fitting of sample spectra. Multiple 100-micron-scale co-enrichments of Fe, Mn and P were found in the samples (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), indicating authigenic Fe-Mn phosphate crystals in the sediments. The P, Fe and Mn XANES spectra collected on these crystals (not shown) suggest a combination of Fe(II) and Fe (III) phosphates with variable concentrations of Mn. These results are consistent with bulk sediment extraction data and porewater concentrations of Fe and Mn. The P-EXAFS test data yielded reasonable results on both standard powders (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and on P enrichments in samples, providing the P XRF counts were sufficiently high to give lownoise spectra.</p><p>The experiment proceeded as planned, without technical problems, and was greatly assisted by the expertise of Camille R i v a r d . T h i s w o r k w i l l c o n t r i b u t e t o t h r e e m a n u c r i p t s f o r publication in peer-reviewed journals. The first of these is at an advanced stage of preparation as of March 2015. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
