<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental studies of ultra-high pressure (P&gt;1 Mbar) polyamorphism in the covalently bonded network forming amorphous systems has long been a challenging topic. There is not yet enough experimental data for convincingly describe the densification and evolution of local structures in the common simple amorphous materials including SiO2 and other geophysical relevant disordered systems under ultrahigh pressures (e.g., conditions in the deep Earth). In this project, we have aimed to investigate the densification and evolution of local structures in the simple network forming glasses under ultrahigh pressures exceeding 150 GPa using GeSe2 as the model system using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), a technique ideally suited for the studying the local properties of disordered systems. GeSe2 is a particular network forming glass from the XAS technique point of view, allowing to probe both cation (Ge) and anion (Se) local sites along the same compression run. Such experimental data enable us to perform double edge EXAFS refinements on extended k-range yielding more accurate quantitative local structural information.</p><p>We have planned the beam time for measuring two separate runs. The first run was planned for a target pressure of 150 GPa. The sample for this run was loaded without pressure transmitting mediums (PTM) due to practical reasons and also to avoid possible infiltration of the gas PTMs into the glass structure. The second compression run was planned for a target pressure of about 50-60 GPa, for a sample loaded with Ne as PTM in order to investigate the possible effects of such PTMs. Diamond anvils were equipped with nano-polycrystalline diamond (NPD) anvils to obtain glitch free EXAFS data.</p><p>During our beam time, nearly 3 days of intervention was necessary to solve the problems related with the accelerator tunnel. However, using the remaining 9 shifts of beam time, we could successfully measure a complete set of EXAFS data scanning through both Ge and Se K-edges, reaching ~160 GPa. Pressures in this experiment were calibrated by measuring the XRD patterns of gold. XRD patterns were collected also for the GeSe2 glass for monitoring the sample states (amorphous or crystal). No evidence of crystallization was observed.</p><p>The complete set of XAS data are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. As far as we know, this is possibly the first double-edge EXAFS measurement that has been performed exceeding Mbar pressure range. Quality of the EXAFS data is quite good thanks to the excellent performance of the BM23 beamline setup.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, XANES range shows very obvious changes, indicating large structural modifications both in the short and medium range ordering under pressure. An interesting feature of pressure dependent changes in the XANES range is the clear shift in the edge energies, which show a two-step process.</p><p>A large redshift of Ge K-edge (2 eV at 100 GPa) and opac sample colour at higher pressures are the solid evidence of a gradual band gap close along a semiconductor to metallic transition of the GeSe2 glass. Interestingly, energy shifts at the Ge and Se K-edges show different trends (red shift at the Ge K-edge and blue shift at the Se K-edge). We are currently performing molecular dynamics simulations for understanding the exact origin of such a behaviour in the XAS data. Fig. 2, (a,b): Ge and Se K-edge XA NES data for selected pressures (c): pressure dependent energy shift of Ge and Se K-edges. (d) optical image of the sample at selected pressures.</p><p>Preliminary double-edge EXAFS experiments have also been performed using the GNXAS method. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we report an exemplary double-edge refinement performed for P=4.0 GPa. As it can be seen, the agreement between the theoretical and experimental signals are perfect thanks to the ability of the GNXAS method for taking into account the effects of double-electron excitation channels and also the artifacts introduced by the Pt mirrors (of the KB system) in this pressure range.</p><p>Because of the large correlations between the fitting parameters, we are currently performing molecular dynamics simulations as well for having a guide for more careful and accurate refinement of the complete set of high quality EXAFS data that we have obtained during our beam time. By advanced experimental and theoretical methods, we expect reliable quantitative local structural information for describing the pressure induced densification mechanisms in GeSe2 glass and similar systems. We expect to publish a good quality article that can be referenced for the future studies in the field. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
