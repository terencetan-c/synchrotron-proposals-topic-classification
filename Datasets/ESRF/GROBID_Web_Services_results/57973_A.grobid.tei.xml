<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Tom Vander Hoogerstraete, Bieke Onghena, Joris Roosen, Sofia Riano Torres Name of institute : Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Laboratory/Department : Laboratory of Coordination Chemistry Address : Molecular Design and Synthesis Department of Chemistry Celestijnenlaan 200F 3000 LEUVEN BELGIUM As new users, we have succeeded in measuring approximately 60 different samples during 9 shifts of 8 h. The edges of 6 different elements were measured: Br, In, Nd, Eu, Dy and Lu. About 80% of these measurements gave valuable and useful data. Bad data sets were often obtained in case of samples with low metal concentrations.</p><p>All results will be used for publication (6 manuscripts) and as input for future proposals at DUBBLE. We were satisfied with the beamline performance and the help of the beamline scientist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bromine</head><p>A few samples HBr extracted to the organic compound trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bromide were measured and gave very good data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, left). The data will be used in a manuscript about the extraction of acids towards quaternary compounds. Tests on the stability and quality of the data on a tribromide compounds were performed as well. The EXAFS function was of high quality and the compound seems to be stable. This type of compounds and measurements is calling for a new proposal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, right). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Indium</head><p>The speciation of indium into trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride was studied as well and will be incorporated into a manuscript about the extraction of this metal towards quaternary compounds. The spectra were of very good quality because of the high energy K-edge of indium. The indium complex has allready been modelled and seemed to be InCl4 -(Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rare earths (Nd, Eu, Dy, Lu) (1)</head><p>The extraction of the rare earths towards sterically sterically hindered alkyl phosphonic acids was studied as well and compared to an industrially used extractant. The data quality was rather poor, as the concentrations were low. However, the XANES part of the spectrum (and part of the EXAFS) could be used and showed that the complexes formed with sterically hindered alkyl phosphonic acids showed no difference with the complexes formed by the industrially used extractants. This information can be used further to make even more sterically hindered extractants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rare earths (Nd, Eu, Dy, Lu) (2)</head><p>The extraction of the rare earths towards the quaternary compound trihexyltetradecylphosphonium nitrate and trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride was studied by XAFS. The data are of good quality and will be used in a manuscript that studies the speciation of the rare earths extracted to these type of compounds. An example of a typical EXAFS spectrum and its FT can be found in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
