			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Some studies showed, in the case of Polylactide (PLA), that a brittle to ductile transition (B-D transition) can be induced thanks to appropriate thermomechanical treatments. As the brittleness of PLA is one of its main drawbacks, understanding this behavior is of prime interest. The origin of this transition, in the case of PLA, was ascribed to the formation of an ordered phase during stretching i . However, a similar transition is observed in the case of polystyrene (PS) even if this polymer remains amorphous. The goal of this work thus lies in a better understanding of the B-D transition for bi-oriented PLA films. The role of strain-induced phases as well as the chain orientation in the ductility improvement will be investigated. Thus, two PLA grades, a crystallizable and a non crystallizable one, will be compared in order to separate the respective effects of crystalline structure and macromolecular orientation on the mechanical behavior.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives:</head><p>Particularly, the main goal of this study was to accurately determine the relationships between the macromolecular orientation degree and the plastic deformation mechanisms involved during cold drawing of initially amorphous Polylactide, and more generally of initially amorphous polymers. Particularly it consisted in studying parameters such as crazing density, crazes sizes, kinetics of developments, as a function of the initial macromolecular orientation.</p><p>Another goal of this work was to assess the influence of the presence of an initially ordered phase on this behavior. Indeed, ordered structures such as crystals or mesomorphic phases, can be induced upon biaxial stretching and it is of prime interest to know if and how they influence the brittle to ductile transition. Thanks to these data it would be thus possible to get information about the structural origin of the crazing to shear banding transition responsible of the stretchability enhancement of PLA. In addition, tests will be also carried out on biaxially stretched PS in order to assess if the origin determined on PLA is the same in the case of PS and thus can be transpose to amorphous polymers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental :</head><p>In situ simultaneous SAXS/WAXS experiments during uniaxial stretching at room temperature were carried out on as cast PLA and PLA films biaxially drawn according to different conditions. Particularly, in order to separate the effects of crystallinity from the ones of macromolecular orientation, two types of PLA were tested to know:</p><p>-C-PLA which is a grade able to crystallize.</p><p>-NC-PLA which is a grade unable to crystallize. In the same way, films of PS have been also tested.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results :</head><p>The mechanical tests carried out, depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, indicate that the unstretched (isotropic) samples are very brittle, while a ductile behavior is observed for the C-PLA samples as soon as the biaxial draw ratio is above 2x2. Similar evolution is observed for NC-PLA except that the transition occurs for a slightly higher critical draw ratio, i.e. 2.5x2.5. These results confirm the thermomechanically induced B-D transition in both PLAs. Regarding the origin of this B-D transition, results obtained by means of SAXS and depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, clearly show that it originates from a transition from crazing to shear banding.</p></div>

An example of SAXS results obtained is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>. A quantitative analysis of the results revealed that the increase of the biaxial stretching ration, i.e. of the macromolecular orientation, involves a decrease of the crazing density while the geometry of the craze (i.e. fibrils diameter and mean distance between fibrils) remains unchanged. This result is of prime interest to understand the origin the crazing to shear banding transition. Indeed, complementary experiments allowed us to determine that the origin of the crazing to shear banding transition is due to the fact that macromolecular orientation involves an increase of the critical nucleation stress of crazing which, the increase of elongation, became higher than the critical stress for activation of shear banding.</p><p>0.1 1 10 100 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 Normalized Intensity (a.u.) q (Å -1 ) Vertical scattering As-cast 1.25x1.25 1.5x1.5 1.75x1.75 2x2 lxl = 2x2 As-cast lxl = 1.25x 1.25 lxl = 1.5x 1.5 lxl = 1.75x 1.75 λ increase 0.1 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 0.001 0.01 0.1 Normalized Intensity (a.u.) q (Å -1 )</p><p>Horizontal scattering λ increase</p></div>
