<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Report experiment SI-816</head><p>Information on C60 interacting with Si(100) substrate was obtained by Surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) at ID03. We studied the C60 molecules adsorbed on Si(100)-2x1 deposited at room temperature (RT) and after different annealing treatments from 700K to 1100 K. In particular, we focused on the mechanism of cage and local substrate deformations induced on the substrate by heating, up to the fullerene decomposition and SiC islands formation.</p><p>During the measurements we recorded intensities of the Si(100) Crystal Truncation Rods (CTR) and of the fractional order rods corresponding to the 2x1 reconstruction. Surface cleanliness and C60 calibration were verified by Auger spectroscopy. As expected no new reconstructions have appeared during and after C60 deposition and thermal treatment. During the RT deposition, the SXRD analysis reveals the existence of the Si surface reconstruction fractional peaks. The intensity of the fractional order peaks slowly decreased as the deposition proceeds because of the absorption of the C60 overlayers but it never disappears. This behaviour indicates that the underlying Si substrate reconstruction is not dheavily affected by the fullerene deposition at RT. It is only during the thermal treatment that fractional order rods intensities vanish.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The fractional peaks disappear only after annealing at 700 K. The analysis of SXRD measurements show that the thermal treatment induce an increased roughness with C atoms diffusing into the first two surface layers. The Crystal truncation rods have been measured after thermal treatment of the C60/Si(100) system at temperatures of 700, 920, 1050 and 1100 K. The CTR intensity is reduced indicating a strong deviation of the system morphology from the surface order caused by annealing. For heating at temperature of 920 K the surface is completely destroyed and the morphological disorder involves several layers (&gt;100 nm), while at 1050 K there is a further increasing of morphological disorder. A further thermal treatment at T=1100 K reverses the roughness to the value obtained at 920 K annealing temperature and diffraction peaks of SiC are detectable. This work has been performed during the PhD thesis of Souad Bakari (XVII cycle anno 2005 of Italian PhD in Physics at the Universita' di Modena e Reggio Emilia). The publication preparation of this results is in progress.</p><p>Moreover we characterized by X Ray Reflectivity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and XRD thin zincblend SiC (3C) films obtained ex situ by codeposition of C60 and Silicon in UHV. The crystallinity and orientation of the grown 3C-SiC films was confirmed by XRD on the samples grown at 1370 K. An example of the measured Bragg peak is shown in   These results have been analysied and are ready for the submission of a new publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig. 1</figDesc></figure>
