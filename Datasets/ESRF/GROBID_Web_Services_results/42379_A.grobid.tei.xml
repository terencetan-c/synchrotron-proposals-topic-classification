<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Monazite and zircon from polymetamorphic terrains as well as six age reference monazite samples were selected with the Jeol electron microprobe at CAU Kiel, based on cathodoluminescence (zircon) and on back scattered electron images and results obtained from single point chemical ages following the procedure of <ref type="bibr">Braun &amp; Appel (2006)</ref> for monazite. SR XRF measurements were performed at the nano imaging beamline ID22NI at ESRF, Grenoble, with a beam size of 190 nm horizontal and 164 nm vertical. The excitation energy was set to 17.6 keV in order to allow the simultaneous detection of REE and Pb, Th and U via L-shell excitation and elements with Z between 14 and 39 via K-shell excitation, but exclude the excitation of the Zr K-edge. Fluorescence signals were recorded with an energy-dispersive SDD detector situated at 15° from the sample in confocal geometry. We performed elemental mappings as well as line and point scan measurements. For elemental mappings, the exposure time was normally set to a second or below. Line scans were performed at longer counting times in order to retrieve better statistics on elements with low concentrations. Exposure times for single point measurements were as high as 100 sec per point. Those measurements were only performed on the reference samples used for age dating in order to get very precise concentrations of the elements Pb, Th and U. It can been shown that the analytical settings and conditions allowed simultaneous detection of K, Mn, Fe, Rb, Ce, Dy, Er, Yb, Lu, Hf, Pb, Th and U in zircon. In a zircon from an area with multiple magmatic and metamorphic events within a short time interval, a correlation could be found between the elements Dy, Er, Hf, Lu, Pb, Th, U and Yb with features revealed by cathodoluminescence in a zircon with an older core and overgrowth rim. The boundary between the inherited core and the overgrowth was sharp also for U, Th and Pb on the 250 nm scale, indicating this to be a true overgrowth with minimal or no recrystallization and scavenging of the core. First results have already been presented at a conference. Another case study environment was a polymetamorphic terrane: three differet ages were found with chemical age mapping using an EPMA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) in a monazite. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the results for a tricoloured U-Th-Pb elemental map of the monazite obtained from nano-imaging at ID22NI in comparison to the BSE image. During the experiment, we obtained results from all our preselected case study samples and trace element distribution patterns could be linked to features observed with CL and BSE images. The method of age calculations based on Pb-Th-U concentrations is still being improved aiming at the best possible precision. However, the data show already that trace elemental mapping on the nanoscale of monazite and zircon is an extremely powerful tool with a clear potential in the future. 1 Deutsches-Elektronen Synchrotron DESY, a Research Centre of the Helmholtz Association, Germany ( * karen.appel@desy.de)</p><p>2 Institute of Geosciences, CAU Kiel, Germany 3 European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France 4 Department of Geology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, U.S.A.</p><p>Monazite and zircon are among the most important accessory minerals used for U-Th-Pb geochronology of metamorphic and igneous rocks. Additionally, both minerals have a high potential to be used as geothermometers <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. Although widely used in geochronology, the chemical stability and growth mechanisms of monazite and zircon are poorly understood. Using synchrotron radiation induced X-ray fluorescence analysis (SR XRF) at a high spatial resolution below 250 nm, we studied trace element distribution in monazite and zircon from case study localities with the aim to identify and characterize growth domains and their boundaries. This information will be correlated with age information obtained from chemical age dating by the procedure described by <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. A similar technique is to be developed for chemical age dating of zircon with SR XRF.</p><p>Monazite and zircon from polymetamorphic terrains as well as six age reference monazite samples were selected with the Jeol electron microprobe at CAU Kiel, based on cathodoluminescence (zircon) and on back scattered electron images and results obtained from single point chemical ages following the procedure of [5] for monazite.
