If the abstract is in a language other than English, please include an English translation. • bear in mind that the double-page report will be reduced to 71% of its original size, A4 format. A type-face such as "Times" or "Arial" , 14 points, with a 1.5 line spacing between lines for the text produces a report which can be read easily.</p><p>Note that requests for further beam time must always be accompanied by a report on previous measurements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ME-815</head><p>Beamline: BM 20 Preliminary data analysis was performed using the EXAFSPAK software. Theoretical scattering amplitudes and phases for each adsorber and backscattered pair were calculated with the program FEFF8. In general, the Th-O distance (around 2.4 Å ) seems to be much shorter in the sorption samples than in the aqueous sample while in this later case the coordination number of the oxygen shells is higher. In some cases a shell at ~3.9Å showing Th-Th interactions is obtained. The ~3.5 Å shell seems to correspond to the interaction Th-Fe, which has not been previously reported as far the authors are aware.</p></div>

The selection of Th as metal to study is straigthfoward. Under the reducing environment expected to develop in the vicinity of the spent nuclear fuel stored in the repository, the most stable redox states for the long-lived actinides is the tetravalent state (Th(IV), U(IV) and Pu(IV) mainly). The elucidation of the structure of the surface species formed between the surface of the corrosion products and these metals will help in the understanding of their sorption mechanims, what can lead to a better and more proper assessment of the concentrations of these metals likely to occur when in contact with the mineral. This can have important implications in risk assessment given that normally the sorption processes are conceptualised as distribution coefficients in the mentioned risk assessments, what poses important limitations to the confidence-building process necessary to ensure in this type of safety exercises. EXPERIMENTAL: sorption experiments onto ferrihydrite (THF) and magnetite (THM) samples have been conducted at pH 3-4 and initial concentrations below the solubility of the most amorphous Th oxides reported. In order to maximize the surface coating of the solid, several enrichment cycles have been followed. Surface coating has been conducted from supersaturation and from undersaturation Z:\projects\03_Altres\XAS\february_04\ExReForm_feb.doc experiments. EXAFS spectra of standard ThO 2 •xH 2 O(s) (THREF) pellet and an aqueous reference sample at pH=3 (THAQ2) have been also recorded .</figDesc></figure>
