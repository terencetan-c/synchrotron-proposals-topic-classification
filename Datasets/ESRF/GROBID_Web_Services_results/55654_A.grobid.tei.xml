<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objective and expected results:</head><p>Arrays of size selected bimetallic nanoparticles are extremely promising from a magnetic point of view, but still remain difficult to achieve by conventional physical techniques (atomic deposition). In this domain, we aim at studying the organization and determining the surface pinning sites (steps, kinks..) of preformed size selected CoPt nanoparticles soft-landed on both Au (111) and Au (677) surfaces. The evolution of the system (organization, cluster coalescence...) with post annealing processes (required to obtain chemically ordered CoPt nanomagnets) will also be studied. According to previous results based on cluster deposition on surfaces (CoPt on graphite, Pt on graphene and Pd on gold) that reveal the extreme sensitivity of preformed clusters to atomic defects or superstructures, we should be able to obtain organized networks of size selected CoPt alloy clusters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and preliminary conclusions:</head><p>Five samples of nanoparticles deposited on a gold monocrystal surface have been prepared and studied at ESRF (after UHV transfer from the PLYRA platform in Lyon, where the size-selected clusters are deposited, to the BM32 beamline UHV chamber). Two different surfaces have been used: Au(111) with the well-known herringbone reconstruction displaying a rectangular array of specific sites and a vicinal Au(677) surface where regularly spaced steps are present in addition to the reconstruction (note that due to the miscut of this surface, kinks are also present on the steps). We have considered CoPt clusters of two different sizes (2.3 nm and 3.5 nm diameter, corresponding respectively to a 150 V and 450 V deviation voltage in the MS-LECBD setup), with surface densities of a few thousands of clusters per µm 2 . In addition, a sample of pure Co particles (4.9 nm diameter, 450 V deviation voltage) deposited on Au(111) has been studied at the end of the beam-time.</p><p>Interesting results have been obtained from XRD and GISAXS measurements, which have been performed as a function of the annealing temperature (from room temperature to around 700°C). Although the precise analysis of the data is still ongoing, the main conclusions are the following:</p><p>-No 2D spatial organization of the nanoparticles has been detected (no extra correlation peak in GISAXS patterns);</p><p>-The largest particles (CoPt and Co) are found to be in epitaxy with the Au surface;</p><p>-The surface reconstruction is perturbed by the cluster deposition, but is still present (especially the steps of the Au vicinal surface);</p><p>-Annealing has a strong influence, with a more visible epitaxy and disturbance of the surface structure, eventually resulting in an over-layer formation (particles disappear at high temperature);</p><p>-For the Au(677) surface covered by CoPt nanoparticles, the steps periodicity, as seen from XRD, is irreversibly modified upon annealing, while it is unmodified on the GISAXS patterns: this surprising result may be related to some step bunching or what is called an "adsorbate induced faceting" phenomenon (unprecedented feature with clusters deposited on a surface!).</p><p>In the end, the deposited particles have not diffused on the surface to self-organize on the preexisting pattern, but instead a strong interaction between CoPt (and Co) clusters and the Au surface has been put into evidence, with original results (particle epitaxy, impact on the steps for the vicinal surface) that should motivate further experimental and theoretical investigations.   <ref type="formula">111</ref>) spectrum with the one measured (at room temperature) after cluster deposition.
