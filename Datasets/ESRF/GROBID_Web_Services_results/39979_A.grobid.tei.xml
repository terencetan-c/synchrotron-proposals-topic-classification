<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Nowadays, it is still object of research whether perovskite ABO 3 systems belong to the order-disorder or to the displacive ferroelectric phase transition classes. Due to the importance of working out information about the dipole moment formation in ferroelectrics, the XAFS (X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) technique was proposed to detect changes in the local atomic structure induced by an externally applied electric field.</p><p>As well as Standard EXAFS data, Quick EXAFS measurements before and after the application of the electric field were undertaken for improving sensitivity. In order to measure at different relative orientations between the photon polarization vector ε r and the electrical field vector E r , two sample holders were built.</p><p>The first of them, consisting of two metallic electrodes with a gap of 2 mm, allowed a maximum electric field of 10 kV/cm and positions ε r r ⊥ E , ε r r E ; and the second, consisting of two aluminum foils separated by the 0.5 mm sample thickness, permitted a maximum electric field of 40 kV/cm and positions</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ε r r ⊥ E , ε r r ∠ E .</formula><p>EXAFS measurements were recorded in transmission mode on powder samples at the BM29 beam line, which was monochromatized by a Si (111) double-crystal. The samples chosen for this proposal were standard ones: KNbO 3 , ferroelectric at RT (Room Temperature) and SrTiO 3 , paraelectric at RT.</p><p>Differenciating the data measured with and without electric field, the derivative effect, which mainly appears at the edge energy, is reduced as the spectra accumulation increases. However, Standard measurements do not give enough energy reproducibility to detect subtle changes in absorption fine structure as measurements with and without electric field are quite separated in time. This trouble is overcome with Quick EXAFS, as we manage to subtract spectra measured much closer in time (13 seconds for collecting each complete spectrum) and averaging enough number of these pair measurements to minimize the statistical noise.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the average of Quick EXAFS difference spectra for KNbO 3 at the Nb K-edge and SrTiO 3 at the Sr K-edge measured with the second sample holder. The pair of measurements with and without electric field was repeated 800 times for KNbO 3 and 300 times for SrTiO 3 . Both measurements were carried out with the maximum electric field and thus for an electric field increase ∆E = 40 kV/cm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the average of Quick EXAFS difference spectra for SrTiO 3 at the Sr K-edge measured with the second sample holder for different electric field increases ∆E = 40, 20, 5, 0 kV/cm. For all values of the electric field, each pair of measurements was repeated 100 times.  According with these results, no difference is found for KNbO 3 with a noise level of ±0.5•10 -4 . On the other hand, the average of Quick EXAFS difference spectra for SrTiO 3 yields a signal which is of similar </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

It has been found out that this difference signal is in phase with the corresponding EXAFS signal weighed by k 2 and therefore, temperature changes of about 5 K.No structures were found for either KNbO 3 or SrTiO 3 using the first sample holder, and results obtained for SrTiO 3 with the second sample holder are the same for 90 and 45º between E are in the same order of magnitude than results obtained in [1]; we can confirm that in this first test, it has been checked that Quick EXAFS at the high quality performance BM29 beam line is a valid technique for the measurement of tiny atomic displacements on the local scale induced by external perturbations.[1] M.
