<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The bacterial heme-containing catalase peroxidase HPI encoded by the katG gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is responsible for the sensibility to INH (isonicotinic acid hydrazide), one of the principal antituberculosis drugs. The INH susceptibility of M.tuberculosis results from the conversion of the drug into bioactive compounds which interfere with a number of processes involved, in particular, in the mycolic acid synthesis. Clinical mutations which alter catalase activity result in high levels of resistance to INH. The HPI subunit consists of about eight hundred aminoacids organised in two domains that each should bear resemblance to plant peroxidases. Crystals from the C terminal and from the intact homologous HPI protein from B.stearothermofilus have been obtained</p><p>Data collection of native crystals λ= 0.9310Å ∆Φ= 1.0º d= 220 mm R max = 3.5 Å Data was processed using the DENZO package yielding the following cell parameters: P222 a: 84.30 b: 99.25 c: 301.99 90 90 90</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="4,102.96,97.80,375.00,528.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular replacement</head><p>Due to its high homology to yeast ccp, we tried to solve our structure by means of molecular replacement using AMoRe program. Unfortunatedly we weren't unable to find any clear solution. We expect to have pseudosymmetries which may help us to understand its strange crystal arrangement derived from its native patterson map (sections Z= 0, Z=0.25 and Z=0.5). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The structure of the ternary complex of PKCa-C2 domain with Ca 2+ and 1,2-dicaproyl-sn-phosphatidyl-Lserine (DCPS) determined recently <ref type="bibr">(Verdaguer et al., 1999)</ref> showed how one of the the Ca 2+ ions is simultaneously coordinated by the top loops of the C2 domain and by the DCPS head group. In addition, DCPS is bounded by positively charged residues that surround the Ca 2+ binding site in the C2 domain and part of the fatty acyl chains present hydrophobic interactions with residues from the CBR3 but remain partially exposed to the solvent. Now, we have determined the structure of this C2 domain crystallised in presence of Ca 2+ and the short chain phospholipids 1,2-diacetyl-sn-glycerophosphatidyl-L-serine (DAPS) and 1,2-dicaproyl-sn-phosphatidic acid (DCPA).Choosing the head groups PS and PA, we would like to structurally analyse the preference of the PKCa-C2 domain for PS over PA. In addition, the choice of the shorter hydrocarbon chain for DAPS was in order to better accommodate the phospholipid ligand in the Ca 2+ binding pocked.</p><p>Diffraction data to resolution of 1.9 Å for the DAPS complex and to 2.0 Å for the DCPA crystals were measured at 100K. The coordinates of the isolated PKCa-C2 domain were used as a model to determine the structure of the two complexes by molecular replacement. The final model for the PKCa-C2_Ca 2+ _DAPS complex includes 86 solvent molecules, three Ca 2+ and one phosphate ions and two DAPS molecules . One DAPS molecule was located in the Ca 2+ binding site in close contact with one of the calcium ions (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) ion in an equivalent positions to that found previously in the DCPS complex <ref type="bibr">(Verdaguer et al., 1999)</ref>. The second DAPS molecule was located at the conserved positively charged cluster which involves the lysine residues 197,199,211 and 213 from strands b3 and b4 suggesting a new site for phospholipid binding (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Fig1. View of the 2Fo-Fc map of the Ca2+ binding site of the PKCa-C2_Ca 2+ _DAPS ternary complex.</p><p>The PKCa-C2_Ca 2+ _DCPA ternary complex includes 77 solvent molecules, three Ca 2+ and two DCPA molecules . As in DAPS complex, the two DCPA molecules were located in the Ca 2+ binding site and in contact with the lysine cluster respectively (Fig2)  </p></div>			</div>
