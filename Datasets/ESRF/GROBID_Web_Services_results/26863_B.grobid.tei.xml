<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shifts:</head><p>Report:</p><p>The aim of the experiment was the investigation of the electronic structure in the series of RNiO 3 perovskites (R = rare earth) as a function of temperature across their metal-insulator (MI) transition. With the exception of R = Lanthanum, all nickelate compounds display MI transition, with critical temperature T MI increasing with decreasing size of the rare earth ion. There is no consensus on the mechanism responsible for the instabilities [1], but recent x-ray and neutron diffraction data revealed that the MI transition is accompanied by a change of crystal symmetry from orthorombic to monoclinic. Based on the formal Ni 3+ (t 6 2g e 1g ) configuration, the possible ordering of the d x2-y2 and d z2 orbitals [2] was suggested. We have demonstrated in the case of cuprates that Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering reveals final states having d occupation with different symmetry with respect to the ground state <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The d-d excitations are a fingerprint of the d N configuration, and since they are dipole forbidden they can only be reached by a second-order optical process like RIXS. They appear in the spectra as a set of characteristic loss structures below the elastic peak.</p><p>The measurements were performed on ID8 using the AXES (Advanced X -Ray Emission Spectrograph, combined ∆E &lt; 0.6 eV at 850 eV) instrument installed on the beamline and operated by the group of the Politecnico of Milano. We measured resonant x -ray valence emission of the Ni Lα 1 line (2p 6 3d N -2p 5 3d N+1 -(2p 6 3d N )*), excited across the L 3 edge (2p 3/2 , hν IN = 853 eV).</p><p>We performed a complete RIXS investigation of PrNiO 3 and NdNiO 3 , at Room Temperature and below T MI , i.e. at 120 K for PrNiO 3 (T MI = 130 K) and at 160 K for NdNiO 3 (T MI = 200 K).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows emission spectra of PrNiO 3 , at incident energies across the Ni L 3 threshold. The spectra display a weak elastic peak and a complex lineshape arising from crystal-field and charge-transfer excitations. No differences were seen between PrNiO 3 and NdNiO 3 . We also measured Oxygen Kα emission, which as well did not show notable changes upon rare earth subsitution.</p><p>No changes could be detected upon cooling below T MI (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). By monitoring the edge jump of the absorption signal (drain current) we could see an intensity change that we attribute to the insulating behavior at low temperature. Due to their irreversibility upon heating, some observed spectral changes in RIXS during the cooling had to be attributed to contamination of the sample (a pellet of compressed powder).</p><p>The most probable reason for the lack of success of the experiment seems the heavily metallic-like, broad lineshapes that mask possible small spectral differences.</p><p>In a related proposal on ID26 (experiment HE1620) we have used high-resolution partial fluorescence yield XAS and resonant inelastic x -ray scatterin at the Ni K edge ( 1s, hν IN = 8.33 keV) to observe differences in the Ni electronic structure across the MI transition in various RNiO 3 compounds. We could observe differences only for nickelates involving Gadolinium and Lutetium, i.e. rare earths atoms of smaller radius that induced the strongest distortion of the lattice. The effect as observed in the Partial Fluorescence Yield spectra is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> for the case of LuNiO 3 . A change is seen in the preedge region related to the 1s-3d quadrupolar absorption. The effect is however very small and could be observed only for nickelates involving the late rare earths, that were not available during Experiment HE1545.</p><p>(During the mentioned experiment HE1620 we measured also cobaltite compounds, data of both families are currently under analysis and will be reported soon).</p><p>1 M.
