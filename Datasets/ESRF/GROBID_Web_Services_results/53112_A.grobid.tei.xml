<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The neuronal protein α-synuclein is natively unfolded, but it can adapt a number of different conformational states depending on environmental conditions and addition of cofactors. This protein plays a critical role in the molecular mechanism of Parkinson's disease. The aim of this SAXS experiment was to investigate the structure of different α-synuclein oligomers and fibrils.</p><p>Our experiment had several sub-experiments. First of all, we are interested in determining the aggregation numbers, size and shapes of several oligomeric species of wild-type α-synuclein and α-synuclein mutants. In figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> the scattering curve alpha-synuclein WT oligomers (figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) and its Guinier plot (figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) are presented. From the Guinier plot we estimated a radius of gyration of ~8 nm. We will further try to determine the shape of these oligomers by fitting the curves and try to estimate the aggregation numbers. Kratky plots of the oligomer scattering curves will give us some information about the globularity of these structures. a b respectively. At the highest tubulin concentration the fibrils are much shorter. That the intensity is lower at higher tubulin concentrations could be due to the scattering particles being smaller. The interactions between the amyloid fibrils are strongly influenced by the ionic strength. To get some insight in the mechanism of these interactions we used different cations, keeping the anion constant. In figure 3 Xray scattering curves of the monovalent salts NaCl and CsCl (figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) and the divalent salts CaCl 2 and BaCl 2 (figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>) are presented.</p><p>For both the monovalent and divalent salts the scattering intensity of the gels with the heavier cation is higher. This indicates that the ions are present in the gels. The valence of the ions seems to be very important, since the scattering intensity of the gels containing BaCl 2 is much higher than the scattering intensity of the gels containing monovalent ions (figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>).</p><p>Another experiment we have performed is measuring the Small Angle X-ray Scattering of 300 µM αS gels with different ages (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weeks) as function of the temperature, of which we measured the rheology at our own lab. Unfortunately we have not been able so far to reduce the data of this experiment, due to the very little support and poor manual of the data reduction software. Therefore we are unable to show any of these data at this stage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>So far the results of these scattering experiments have given valuable insight in determining the size of the oligomers, in the structural aspects of alpha-synuclein tubulin fibril formation and in the mechanism of gel formation at high ionic strength. We hope that, once we are able to reduce the temperature data, we have new insights in the structures that are forming during increasing and decreasing the temperature of alpha-synuclein gels that could help us with the interpretation of our rheology data. a b</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(*indicates experimentalists): Mireille.
