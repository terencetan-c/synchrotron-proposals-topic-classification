<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Black phosphorus shows rich and astonishing properties under pressure which remain however largely understudied as highlighted by the recent discovery of a new electronic transition at low temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> The aim of the proposal HC-2348 was to measure XANES/XAFS at the phosphorus K-edge under pressure and as a function of the temperature. It should bring matchless information on the evolution of the phosphorus electronic structure as a function of the hydrostatic pressure and temperature, in particular sensitive to its 3p states which are directly correlated to its semi-conductor properties. Beside scientific questions, the proposal HC-2348 was also aiming at extending the energy range for which x-ray absorption experiments can be carried out under high-pressure. It should be recalled that this represents a major technical challenge. For instance, at the phosphorus K-edge, the lost in photon flux due to the highpressure conditions can be estimated as follow: decrease by a factor 6 due to focalization with Be lenses, 0.08% of transmission of incoming light though a 30 µm diamond plate, and 0.06% of transmission of the fluorescence. At the end the signal can be anticipated to be to at least 1300 smaller than that taken in normal conditions.</p><p>2135 2140 2145 2150 2155 2160 2165 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 (4) Pure R.P.</p><p>(3) diluted R.P.</p><p>(2) Pure BP</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XANES (a.u.)</head><p>Photon Energy (eV) (1) Pure BP, 50 µm, 12h (b) High-pressure conditions (6) diluted RP, 30 µm, 20 min Figure. X-ray absorption spectra measured in partial fluorescence mode at the Phosphorus K-edge. (a) in standard conditions (measurement time ~10 min per spectrum). (b) in fully perforated diamond anvil cell with different windows thicknesses for black phosphorus (BP) and red phosphorus (RP).</p><p>The phosphorus K-edge XANES spectra are presented in the figures (a) and (b) here above, recorded in standard and high-pressure conditions, respectively. From these measurements the following remarks can be made:</p><p>• On pure BP crystal (a.2), the spectrum taken in standard conditions clearly shows the edge jump, but no additional spectral features can be distinguished. Self-absorption effects thus turn out to be quite dramatic. Self-absorption corrections can be carried out, cf. spectrum (a.1). The outcome is comparable to BP spectra measured in TEY mode, in particular in terms of intensity of the white line. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> The correction however greatly amplifies the noise, so that a spectrum quality comparable to that of (a.2) is the minimum to have the possibility to address the scientific question.</p><p>• The BP spectra taken at 1.1 GPa in a DAC equipped with 50 µm diamond window correspond to the curves (b.1) and (b.2). The edge jump is well noticeable on a single spectrum measurement. Averaging the data during about 12 h (80 times the standard conditions) leads to a significant improvement of the noise level. However, this latter remains too high to apply the self-absorption corrections. Comparing spectra (a.2) and spectra (b.1) to estimate the noise level indicates that an improvement by a factor 8 is still needed.</p><p>• BP XANES spectra have been measured in DAC equipped with 30 µm diamond window, curves (b.3) and (b.4). The improvement in regards to curves (b.1) and (b.2) is less than a factor 2. On top of that, the highest pressure reachable by these windows is of the order of 3 GPa, so that the approach based on decreasing the window thickness cannot be pursued further for this project.</p><p>• Instead of trying to get spectral quality compatible with the use of self-absorption correction, another strategy has been to tackle the self-absorption effect itself. We dispersed and exfoliated BP flakes in a CHP liquid phase, as done for instance in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, even at concentration of about 8 gL -1 , the BP XANES spectra could not be satisfactorily measured in standard conditions (not shown).</p><p>• We also tried solid-solid dilution using graphite, PTFE, SiO 2 or Al thin powders (particle&lt;5µm). Due to the difficulty to prepare (sub-)micrometric BP powder from the available crystals by ball-milling, we rather used red phosphorus powder as sample. As seen on curves (a.3) and (a.4) taken in standard conditions, the dilution allows to partially recover the white line intensity. Different dilution ratios were tested and an optimum of about 1:25 in PTFE was used to prepare a DAC with 30 µm diamond window. One however immediately sees on the spectra taken in high-pressure conditions that the dilution strongly impairs the signal, curves (b.5) and (b.6). The noise level is significantly larger than on the bulk BP crystals, and the white line intensity does not show any significant improvements.</p><p>To sum up, measurements at the P K-edge under pressure have been made very challenging by strong reabsorption effects, so that the scientific question has not been addressed. The usual ways to limit such reabsorption turn out to be complex to implement in case of high-pressure conditions. It appears necessary to first demonstrate the possibility to measure the P K-edge spectrum at high-pressure in samples not suffering from re-absorption effect, for instance such as in intermetallic alloys containing phosphorus.</p><p>Regarding the use of ESRF beamtime for this project, it should be noted that some tests have been carried out on IHR or BLC time. 4 shifts were used during BLC-9415 for the BP measurements with 50 µm window. 4 shifts were used during BLC-9519 for the BP measurements with 30 µm window. 1 shift during BLC-9894 for BP dispersion. 1 shift during IH-HC-2910 for red P solid-solid dilution. 8 out of 18 shifts have been used for this project during HC-2348 (diluted red P under pressure). The remaining shifts of HC-2348 were used for various IHR purposes. At the end, a total of 18 shifts have been used for this project, preliminary tests included.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):F.
