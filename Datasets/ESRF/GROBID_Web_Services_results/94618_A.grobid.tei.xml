<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This experiment took place remotedly during pandemics. During this tie beam scientists Dimitrios Bessas, Aleksandr Chumakov and Georgios Aprilis analysed a set of individual inclusions in ultra-deep diamonds. These were: majoritic garnets and ferropericlases. Overall, more than 10 inclusions were analysed.</p><p>As a result, the PI has written a paper that was submitted to Nature Communications. It was reviewed and received critical, but positive reviews. The second round of reviews is still in process (as per 11.09.2022).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientic report:</head><p>The lower mantle comprises &gt; 50% of Earth's volume, and compositionally is considered largely homogeneous and primitive or pyrolitic <ref type="bibr">(McDonough, 2016)</ref>. It has been acknowledged, however, that modern-day subducted slabs can penetrate deep into the lower mantle, causing heterogeneities and locally oxidised regions <ref type="bibr">(van Keken et al., 2014)</ref>. The mineralogy of the upper part of the lower mantle is relatively simple: in a pyrolitic system it should consist of approximately 70 vol% bridgmanite ((Mg, Fe)SiO3), less than 20 vol% ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O and less than 10 vol% Ca-Si-perovskite (CaSiO3) <ref type="bibr">(Ringwood, 1991)</ref>. Diamonds and their inclusions are the only available natural samples from Earth's lower mantle. Of more than 300 inclusions reported to date to have derived from the lower mantle, ferropericlase is the most common <ref type="bibr">(Kaminsky, 2012)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the distribution of Mg# in magnesiowüstite (Mg# &lt; 50) and ferropericlase (Mg# &gt; 50) inclusions in lower mantle diamonds reported in the literature. The wide range of compositions displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and the extreme Fe-enrichment (up to 93 wt% FeO) is unlikely to have resulted from a single mechanism. As a consequence, only a fraction of the reported inclusions could be in equilibrium with bridgmanite in pyrolitic lower mantle or with garnet and ringwoodite at the mantle transition zone, suggesting that the sublithospheric mantle is likely to contain highly heterogeneous regions with non-pyrolitic compositions. These regions may contain transported sediments and oceanic crust from the surface of subducting slabs, which are also likely to be more oxidised than the ambient sublithospheric mantle <ref type="bibr">(Kiseeva et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to measure the oxidation state of iron in ferropericlase and magnesiowüstite inclusions in diamond displaying a range of Mg# and to explore the link between their compositions and iron oxidation state. This has particular importance for the storage of oxidised material in the deep mantle, as well as for the speciation of deep mantle fluids, diamond formation, rheological and melting properties at the depths inaccessible for direct sampling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods and results</head><p>Five diamonds, 4-5 mm in size, recovered from alluvial deposits in Sao Luiz, Juina, Brazil were selected for this study. The diamonds were polished flat on both sides so that the inclusions were exposed to the surface prior to analysis. Their size ranged between 20 and 80 µm. Three inclusions (SL14, SL14_2 and SL24) are ferropericlase with Mg# = 79-85, and two inclusions (SL82 and SL5_2) are magnesiowüstite with Mg# = 16 and 40, respectively.</p><p>All inclusions were initially studied by X-ray diffraction. Mg-rich inclusions SL14, SL14_2 and SL24 contained monophase ferropericlase single crystals. The ferric iron content of these inclusions, analysed by Mössbauer spectroscopy, was below the detection limit of ~0.03 Fe 3+ /Fetot. Single crystal X-Ray diffraction at the P02.2 beamline, DESY, identified single crystal inclusions with the sizes larger that 2-5 µm based on X-ray absorption on inclusions exposed at the diamond surface and inside the diamond. X-ray diffraction of SL82 and SL5_2 confirmed the presence of two coexisting monocrystalline phases, magnesiowüstite and magnesioferrite. X-ray absorption was used in order to locate and centre on Xray beam inclusions and the sizes were determined from absorption scans. These scans show different phases spatially separated (i.e. that is not intergrowth) but crystallographically orientated <ref type="bibr">([111]</ref> direction of spinel-structured phase parallel to the [100] direction of the cubic phase). This relationship indicates that they magnesiowüstite and magnesioferrite are cogenetic. Based on XRD and SMS data, magnesioferrite has a magnetite structure or inverse spinel, with some divalent iron substituted by magnesium. Indirect estimates from the integrated peak areas of Mössbauer spectra for SL82 sample (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>) are in a good agreement with X-ray diffraction data, identifying two phases containing iron. The signal for SL5_2, however, is too low to resolve for the ferric iron doublet and the fit of SL 5_2 shows only magnesiowüstite (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). Relative areas in the Mössbauer spectrum (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>) combined with chemical compositions allow us to estimate the proportion of magnesiowüstite in the SL82 inclusion as 42% (considering only the molar ratio of iron-bearing phases, which are magnesiowüstite and magnesioferrite 42% and 58%, respectively). Nevertheless, scanning electron microscopy showed no exsolution phases on the surface of inclusion SL82 (Supplementary figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Thus, we interpret SL82 and SL5_2 inclusions as intergrowths of magnesiowüstite with magnesioferrite.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Mössbauer spectra of inclusions SL 82(A) and SL5_2 (B). (A) Blue doublet corresponds to Fe 2+ in the octahedral site of magnesiowüstite. Green magnetic sextet corresponds to Fe 3+ in octahedral and tetrahedral sites of magnesioferrite, red sextet corresponds to Fe 2.5+ ; i.e., Fe 3+ ↔Fe 2+ rapid electron hopping between octahedral sites of magnesioferrite. (B) Green and blue doublets correspond to Fe 2+ in the octahedral site of magnesiowüstite.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We argue that the wide range of Fe concentrations observed in (Mg,Fe)O inclusions in diamonds and the appearance of magnesioferrite in Fe-rich inclusions result from oxidation of ferropericlase triggered by the introduction of subducted material into sublithospheric mantle.</p><p>-12 -8 -4 0 4 8 12 85 90 95 100 Fe 3+ mag tetr/oct Fe 2.5+ mag oct SL 82 Fe 2+ v (mm/s) Transmission (%) -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 75 80 85 90 95 100 SL 5_2 v (mm/s) Transmission (%)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
