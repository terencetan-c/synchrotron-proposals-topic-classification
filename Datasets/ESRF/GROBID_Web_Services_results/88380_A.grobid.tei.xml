<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have assembled the setup for high-resolution microscopy based on the polymer refractive microlenses [1] at the ID13 beamline (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1. Scheme of setup for high-resolution microscopy of the Siemens Star.</head><p>We used the 12.7 keV energy monocromatic and collimated X-ray beam. Moreover, we used the condenser located at the optics hutch. Siemens star and 25 Œºm-pinhole were also mounted upstream the PCRL 30 on the micro-manipulators. The Siemens star was located at the distance L 1 of 43 mm from the PCRL 30 . According to the thin lens formula</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 ùêπ = 1 ùêø 1 + 1 ùêø 2 (1)</formula><p>Monochromator X-ray CCD L 1 Undulator Siemens star Speckle suppressor 1 m 28.5 m 96 m 10 m Pinhole + PCRL 30 L 2 Condenser</p><p>and assuming that the focal distance F equals F 1 = 41 mm, we located the X-ray detector at the distance L 2 = 885 mm from the PCRL. Thus, we achieved the lens magnification of ùêø 2 ùêø 1 = 20.6, giving an effective detector pixel size of 18 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>However, different resolution in vertical and horizontal directions indicated an asymmetry in contrast transfer function due to presence of astigmatism in the optical system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2. Scanning electron (a) and flatfield-corrected X-ray images (b) of the Siemens star.</head><p>The resolution remains the same after the 5.5-hour X-ray exposure (c).</p><p>To estimate the value of possible radiation damage to the lens, we simply exposed PCRL 30 for 5.5 hours to the X-ray beam with a flux density of 7√ó10 11 photons/sec√ómm 2 . During that time, individual lenses of the PCRL 30 absorbed the average dose of ~ 15 √ó 10 6 Gy each. X-ray radiograms of PCRL 30 before and after exposure (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) show the non-uniform polymer lens shrinkage -lenses almost did not change around the substrate-lens conjunction because of the mechanical stress and therefore higher stability. However, they shrunk significantly around the freestanding top. Despite the complexity of lens shape after the exposure, we roughly estimated the decrease of the size to be 17 ¬± 2% in average. a) b) c) 36 Œºm 38 Œºm 30 Œºm 32 Œºm Before the exposure After the exposure a) b)</p><p>We also repeated the focusing experiment to see the change of the focal distance. PCRL 30 focused the radiation in the circle of the least confusion with 1.8 √ó 1.8 Œºm 2 size and at the focal distance F 2 = 35 ¬± 2 mm. The distance F 2 is 15% smaller than F 1 , which corresponds to our observations of geometrical size reduction. PCRL 30 was still having the astigmatism with meridional and sagittal planes located at distances F m2 = 32 ¬± 2 mm and F s2 = 38 ¬± 2 mm, respectively.</p><p>[1] A.K. Petrov, V.O. Bessonov, K.A.
