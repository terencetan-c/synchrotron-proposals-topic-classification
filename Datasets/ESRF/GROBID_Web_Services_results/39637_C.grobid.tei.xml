Heated inlet and outlet gas lines prevent condensation Cycling studies reveal oxidative dehydrogenation to crotonaldehyde is favoured over non-reducible PdO x clusters, with gas phase oxygen promoting product desorption (Figure 2). High temperatures facilitate reversible cycling of the Pd oxidation state under reducing or oxidising conditions, which in turn favour decarbonylation and combustion pathways associated with metallic clusters. Control of palladium redox properties emerges as a key experimental parameter for future optimisation, with Pd 2+ species identified as crucial for high selectivity. These experiments have enabled us to construct a detailed picture of reaction-induced restructuring in this system (Figure 3), and to identify surface PdO x as the active species.
