<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Synchrotron XAS measurements at the manganese k-edge for Mn(II)-bearing chloride solutions have been successfully conducted at the FAME beamline (BM30B) at ESRF on 17-23 November 2010. The aim of this project was to i) determine the structure (coordination numbers and distances) of Mn(II) chloride complexes at temperatures up to ~500 ˚C at 600 bar, as a function of varying Mn(II)/Cl ratios; ii) derive the formation constants for aqueous Mn(II) chloride complexes; and iii) compare the coordination chemistry of Mn(II) in chloride brines under hydrothermal conditions to that of other divalent transition metals measured by our team (Co(II), Ni(II), Fe(II)) and other groups (Zn(II), Cd(II)).</p><p>Operations at the facility were incident free, and setup and data collection were performed without any significant issues. Mn K-edge EXAFS spectra were collected with NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 m, and temperatures ranging from 30 ˚C to 500 ˚C. In addition three Br-bearing solutions (0.054 m Mn + 0.108 m Br; 0.1 m Mn + 1.2 m Br; 0.063 m Mn + 2.12 m Br) were collected to compare the speciation in the chloride and bromide systems, and indentify unequivocally the stoichiometry of the end-member species, since Br is easily distinguished from O in EXAFS analysis, while Cl and O are difficult to differentiate.</p><p>Preliminary data analysis shows that Mn(II) displays a similar evolution with temperature and chloride concentration as the other divalent transition metals (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, contrary to Fe(II), we did not observe the formation of the fully chlorinated complex [MnCl 4 ] 2-. We are very excited by this result, since a systematic pattern emerges among three geochemical 'twin' elements for which XAS data on chloride complexing to supercritical conditions exist: for Mn/Fe, Ni/Co, and Cd/Zn, the first member of the couple does not form high order complexes ([MCl 3 ] -appears to be stable in highly saline brines; Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), while the second forms fully chlorinated tetrahedral complexes [MCl 4 ] 2-at relatively high salinity and high temperature. These differences can explain the strong fractionation between these metals observed in many hydrothermal systems.  <ref type="figure">(c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>) solutions at 450 ˚C, 600 bar with experimental (blue line) and fitted spectra (red line) shown in both K-space and R-space, respectively. MnBr 3.2 O 0.8 and MnCl 3.0 O 1.0 are the best models to fit for these experimental data. Derived bond lengths of Mn-O and Mn-Cl are 2.24 Ǻ and 2.36 Ǻ, respectively for 10 m Clsolution; and the bond lengths of Mn-O and Mn-Br 2.13 Ǻ and 2.44 Ǻ for the 2 m Br - solution. MnCl 3 (H 2 O) -is be the dominant species in highly saline brines at elevated T and P.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Summary of XANES data collected for solutions with Cl:Mn ratios varying from 2 to 78, as a function of temperature.
