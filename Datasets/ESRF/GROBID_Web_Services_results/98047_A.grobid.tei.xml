			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In a waste-to-value perspective, CO2 direct conversion to hydrocarbons and olefins is generating a great interest in the scientific community in the last decade [1]. In this regard we are investigating tandem catalysts formed by physically mixed ZrO2/CeO2 based oxides with zeolytes/zeotypes [2]. The former catalyst hydrogenates CO2 to methanol, immediately converted to propane/propene by the latter catalyst. Whilst methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction has been widely investigated, CO2-to-methanol is of great interest since being the limiting reaction of the tandem catalyst. This reaction requires a catalyst able to successively split H2 molecule and parallely activate CO2. The latter step is catalysed by presence of oxygen vacancies (VO) forming reactive carbonates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the last years we then prepared and characterized Zn-doped ZrO2 catalyst <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>. For these catalysts, while PXRD presented a single phase diffractogram, thus suggesting a solid solution scenario, Zn and Zr K-edge XAS unveiled Zn segragation as ZnO nanoclusters embedded in the ZrO2 matrix. The so formed ZnO/ZrO2 interface rich in VO was then ascribed to the active phase towards CO2 hydrogenation. Recently Wang et al. successfully prepared ZnCeZrOx catalysts which, compared with ZnZrOx, improved CO2 conversion and propene and butene selectivities when combined with H-RUB-13 catalyst <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. The promising CO2 activation properties were ascribed to the high oxygen vacancies content of the catalyst solid solution.</p><p>Guided by the knowledge gained on ZnZrOx catalysts, in experiment A-31-1-161 we deeply investigated the nature of the ZnCeZrOx active phases after H2 treatment at 400°C by performing combined PXRD/XAS measurements at Zn, Zr and Ce K-edges under in situ conditions for Zn0.5Ce0.2Zr1.8O4 catalyst.</p><p>In particular, the experiment A-31-1-161 at BM31 was aimed to investigate structural (average and local) and electronic variations of the catalyst as prepared and activated (H2/400°C) by PXRD and XAS. The catalyst was loaded in quartz capillaries (ϕ=0.5/1.0 mm) and heated with an heat blower. Gas flow was provided by gas mixing set-up available at the beamline whilst products (mainly H2O from surface reduction) were measured by a downstream mass spectrometer. Diffraction cones were detected by a CCD camera whilst I0 and I1 were recorder by two ioniziation chambers. A third ionization chamber (I2) was used for measuring reference materials (Zn/Zr metal foils and pure CeO2 pellet) for energy alignment. We performed high quality XAS measurements (EXAFS analizable up to k=14Å -1 ) during steady states including :I) as prepared catalyst, II) after H2 activation, III) prior and after reaction. Faster XAS scans (EXAFS analizable up to k=12Å -1 ) followed by PXRD measurements were collected durting H2 activation and under CO2:H2 interactions. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> PXRD data measured for the as prepared and activated catalysts showed as the ZrO2 tetragonal (P42/1nmc) structure is preserved under activation. Hexagonal ZnO reflections, previously not observed from laboratories measurements can be distinguished from ZrO2 one (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> inset), suggesting the presence of bigger ZnO clusters.</p><p>Zr K-edge (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) presented a 1s→4p preedge associated to the ZrO8 double tetrahedral coordination confirming the presence of tetragonal polymorph. EXAFS Zr-Zr second-shell intensity is dampened with respect to pure t-ZrO2 suggesting the presence of Zr-Zn scattering path, as observed in ZnZrOx case. Zn K-edge had similar whiteline as observed for ZnZrOx catalysts: not well structured 1s→4pσ,π transitions and weak EXAFS Zn-Zn second shell. Moreover Zn second shell presented a broadening towards higher radial distances during activation, evidence, as showed in ZnZrO2 case, of the ZnO/ZrO2 interface. Differently from ZnZrOx, a slight shift of Zn edge to lower energies under H2 treatment was observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), particularly visible in the spectra first derivative, suggesting an electronic variation of Zn in the ZnCeZrO catalyst. Interestingly, Ce K-edge showed a substantial Ce 4+ reduction, reaching an edge energy lower than that observed for Ce 3+ , suggesting formation of Ce δ+ (0&lt;δ&lt;3) species. Moreover, Ce K-edge EXAFS presents a complex second shell dynamic, suggesting important variations of Ce local environment under activation. Since Ce is known to form solid solutions with ZrO2, Ce local structural reorganization might be related to the PXRD (110) Bragg peak intensity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) which counterintuevely increases at higher temperature. These results are of oustanding quality from both XRD and XAS viewpoint and will be the basis on further studies on doped ZrO2 catalysts. Moreover, the wide energy range reachable at BM31 allowed us to have a complete view of the as prepared and active catalyst structure: this outstanding dataset represents the core of a manuscript currently in preparation. It would be now of great interest to combine this multi-edge study approach with the BM31 PDF set-up (available from autumn 2022) under operando conditions during the CO2 hydrogenation rection. For this reason a dedicated proposal will be submitted in one of the next rounds.
