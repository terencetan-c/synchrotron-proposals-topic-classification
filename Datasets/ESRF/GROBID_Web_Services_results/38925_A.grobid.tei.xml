<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We investigated the electronic structure and the magnetic properties of oriented Fe octaethyl-porphyrin (OEP) molecules adsorbed onto bare and oxygen-covered Cu(100) single crystals. Since these molecules are paramagnetic the measurements had to be carried out in a high magnetic field and at low temperatures in order to align the magnetic moment of the Fe center. The hybridization of the orbitals of the central metal ion with the substrate modifies the ligand field experienced by the ion and the ion's oxidation state. Thereby basic magnetic properties may be altered, such as the magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropy. The modifications of the electronic structure of the ion and its magnetic properties were studied by means of angle dependent NEXAFS and XMCD measurements at the Fe-L 2,3 edges, respectively. The samples are prepared by evaporation of the molecules from a Knudsen cell at 485 K onto the substrates held at room temperature.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows an STM image of Fe OEP on Cu(100) at room temperature. The intramolecular structure of the porphyrin molecules is resolved. It is directly evident that the Fe-porphyrin molecules adsorb flat on Cu(100). The mobility of the molecules is quite low since they do not agglomerate and hardly change their position between successive images. A coverage of 0.4 monomolecular layers is deduced from the evaluation of several images.</p><p>Angle-dependent X-ray absorption measurements were carried out to study the anisotropy of charge and spin densities of the individual electronic levels of the metal center. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the Fe-L 2,3 edges for different X-ray incidence angles measured at a temperature of T = 8 K in an applied magnetic field of B = 5 T along the X-ray incidence directions. The upper panel shows the helicity-averaged spectra using left and right circularly polarized X rays. The lower panel shows the difference between the two helicities, i.e., the XMCD spectra, reflecting the unoccupied spin density at the Fe site. A sizable XMCD signal is found for all measured incidence angles, evidencing the presence of an Fe magnetic moment. Four resonances can be identified in the XMCD and XAS signals, best visible for normal incidence. Since the applied magnetic field and the temperature were not sufficient to magnetically saturate the molecules, their magnetization might change when varying the direction of the magnetic field due to a magnetic anisotropy of the Fe center. Although the XMCD line shape varies strongly with the incidence angle, the integrated XMCD signal is constant within 10% indicating a negligible magnetic anisotropy of the Fe ion. The L 3 peak position of Fe OEP on Cu(100) is red-shifted by about 1 eV with respect to the one of the Fe(III) OEP Cl bulk sample indicating that the oxidation state of the Fe center on the surface is reduced.</p><p>In a subsequent experiment, we deposited Fe OEP molecules onto a pre-oxidized Cu(100) single crystal, which was prepared by dosing 1200 L of O_2 onto the substrate held at 500 K. As a result, the surface is covered by half a monolayer of atomic oxygen forming a well-known (√2 × 2√2)R45°, so-called missing row, reconstruction. We deposited 0.4 ML of Fe OEP molecules, after cooling the crystal down to room temperature. The Fe-L 3 peak position coincides within 0.2 eV with that of the Fe(III) OEP Cl bulk sample, suggesting an Fe 3+ oxidation state. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the Fe-L 2,3 XAS and XMCD signals which were measured at different X-ray incidence angles and at a temperature of T = 8 K in an applied magnetic field of B = 5 T along the X-ray incidence directions. The most prominent effect is a 5-fold decrease of the XMCD signal when comparing the spectrum at normal incidence to the one at 20°. This decrease can only be explained by the presence of a strong magnetic anisotropy, with the easy axis of the Fe magnetic moment oriented in-plane, as a result of an interaction of the iron centers and the oxygen atoms. This very pronounced effect is astonishing since the coordination of the oxygen atom to the Fe center as a fifth ligand should reduce the tetragonal distortion of the ligand field as it is also reflected by the reduced angular dependence of the line shape of the XAS and XMCD signal. This should lead to a reduction of the orbital moment, which is the driving force of the magnetic anisotropy. Indeed, the orbital to spin moment ratio is in the range of 10% for both samples as evaluated by applying the sum rules. The origin of the strong magnetic anisotropy is currently investigated by means of DFT calculations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Experiment title :</head><label>title</label><figDesc>Fig. 1</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.02,508.86,119.90,119.76" type="bitmap" /></figure>
