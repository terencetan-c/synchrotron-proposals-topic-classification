<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Muscle contraction is driven by arrays of the motor protein myosin II in the thick filaments, which pull the actin-containing thin filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere. At the molecular level, force and filament sliding are due to a structural working stroke in the globular region (variously described as the head domain, or motor domain, or Subfragment 1, S1) of the myosin molecule while it is attached to actin (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). In terms of the crystal structure of S1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>; Rayment 1993b; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dominguez et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Geeves &amp; Holmes, 2005)</ref> the working stroke corresponds to a 70 deg tilting of the light chain domain (LCD) or 'lever arm' of the head about a fulcrum in the converter region of the actin-attached catalytic domain (CD), corresponding to an axial movement (d) of 11 nm between the CD and the C terminus of the LCD that is connected through the rod-like Subfragment 2 (S2) to the thick filament backbone. The mechanical energy of the working stroke is accounted for by ATP hydrolysis in the CD.</p><p>Sarcomere-level mechanics and X-ray interferometry in single fibres from frog skeletal muscle have led to the following description of the function of the array of myosin motors in each thick filament, as they perform different physiological tasks: (i) in isometric contraction (force T 0 ), 20-30% of the 294 myosin heads present in each half-thick filament are attached to actin and each motor bears a force of 5-6 pN, with an elastic strain of less than 2 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Decostre et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Piazzesi et al. 2007</ref>); (ii) during steady shortening against high to moderate loads the number of motors decreases in proportion to the load and the size of the working stroke increases but remains limited to ß6 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Piazzesi et al. 2007)</ref>; and (iii) the full 11 nm stroke expected from crystallographic models is observed only during the early rapid shortening following a stepwise drop to near zero force <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Reconditi et al. 2004</ref>).</p><p>An alternative view is that the isometric force is generated by a small fraction of the actin-attached motors executing a stochastic 11 nm stroke, and this fraction increases at lower loads. This view has been supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Knupp et al. (2009)</ref>, who claim that the X-ray interference data, for all the conditions described above, can be equally well explained by the all-or-none ß11 nm lever arm tilting expected from crystallographic models, assuming that most of the cross-bridge compliance is in the S2 domain (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>).</p><p>The mechanism of force generation critically depends on the value of the stiffness of the individual cross-bridge (ε) that links the thick and thin filaments, and therefore comprises both the head (S1) and S2. An upper limit to the value of ε that is compatible with a stochastic 11 nm working stroke is 1.5 pN nm -1 ; for ε values larger than 1.5 pN nm -1 the mechanical energy implied in the generation of isometric force (E m = ½ε•d 2 &gt; 90 zJ) becomes larger than the free energy released during the hydrolysis of one ATP molecule (83 zJ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barclay et al. 2010</ref> and references therein), making the force generating transition highly unlikely due to the low value of its equilibrium constant.</p><p>The stiffness of the individual cross-bridge in situ can be calculated from the compliances of the half-sarcomere (C hs ) and of the filaments (C f = C A + C M , where C A and C M are the contributions of the thin and thick filaments), using the simplified equation from appendix A of <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ford et al. (1981)</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Linari et al. 1998)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C hs = C f + 1/βe, (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where e is the stiffness of the array of cross-bridges when all the myosin heads are attached to actin and β is the fraction of attached heads. Assuming that all myosin heads are attached in rigor <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cooke &amp; Franks, 1980)</ref>, β = 1 and e can be obtained from the rigor value of C hs . In single fibres of Rana temporaria C f was estimated as ß13 nm MPa -1 by combining X-ray diffraction and mechanical measurements <ref type="bibr">(Piazzesi et al. 2007 and references therein)</ref>. From this value of C f , and given C hs = ß15 nm MPa -1 in rigor <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Piazzesi et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fusi et al. 2010)</ref>, the cross-bridge stiffness ε can be calculated as ß3 pN nm -1 . A similar value of ε was obtained in single fibres of Rana esculenta, using a thermodynamic approach based on the effect of temperature on the isometric force <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Decostre et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Park-Holohan et al. 2012)</ref>.</p><p>The estimates of ε reported above depend on the assumption that C f is independent of force. The assumption of linear filament elasticity has been recently challenged <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Edman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mansson, 2010)</ref>, although on the basis of indirect or contradictory evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Reconditi, 2010)</ref>. Also, the use of eqn (1) has been criticized <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Colombini et al. 2010</ref>) because, at forces &lt;0.4T 0 during the rise of an isometric tetanus, the half-sarcomere (hs) elasticity deviates from that of a linear system composed of filaments with constant compliance in series with an array of myosin cross-bridges with a stiffness that is proportional to the force <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Brunello et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fusi et al. 2010)</ref>. The deviation was attributed to an elastic element with constant stiffness in parallel with the cross-bridge array. It was claimed that ignoring this parallel element could cause an overestimate of up to 40% in values of motor stiffness calculated under the assumption that the half-sarcomere is a linear elastic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Colombini et al. 2010</ref>). However, recent experiments, in which the analysis was extended to forces &lt;0.2T 0 , indicate that the compliance of the parallel element is too large to affect the estimate of the motor stiffness based on the linear model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fusi et al. 2014)</ref>.</p><p>C A and C M can be estimated more directly using X-ray diffraction, but the existing data have some limitations: (i) the estimates were derived from relationships between the force and the axial periodicities along the actin and Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Connection of the myosin head to the filaments and its working stroke A, conformation of the myosin head attached to actin during isometric contraction. The myosin head (or subfragment 1, S1) is formed of a catalytic domain (blue) attached to actin (black and grey) according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Holmes et al. (2003)</ref> and a light chain domain (red) that has an average orientation of θ = 60 deg relative to the filament axis and is connected to the filament backbone (violet) via the coiled-coil subfragment 2 (S2, yellow). The partner head, assumed not to be attached during isometric contraction, and its S2 component are in light grey. B, the crystallographic model of the working stroke. The catalytic domain (CD, blue) of the myosin head is firmly attached to the actin filament, here represented by only three monomers (black and grey). The working stroke consists of an ß70 deg rotation of the light chain domain (LCD) with the fulcrum near Cys707 (yellow circle). The orientation of the LCD is represented as the vector joining the fulcrum to the head-rod junction (residue Lys 843, grey circle). Red and green lines represent the pre-and post-working stroke conformations of the LCD, respectively (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Irving et al. 2000)</ref>.</p><p>J Physiol 592.17 myosin filaments determined using X-ray diffraction from whole muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Huxley et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wakabayashi et al. 1994</ref>) -the cumulative filament compliance derived from those measurements ranged between 10 and 20 nm MPa -1 due to the large variation of force per cross-sectional area (CSA) reported in those papers, probably due to the intrinsic difficulty in measuring the CSA of muscle; and (ii) information on the thick filament periodicity from the strong M3 X-ray reflection on the meridional axis (parallel to the muscle axis) due to the 14.5 nm axial repeat of the myosin heads is not suitable for measuring thick filament compliance, because this reflection is influenced by the actin-attached myosin heads. The weaker, higher order myosin-based reflections, instead, originate mainly from the filament backbone and are the suitable signals for estimating filament compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Huxley et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Piazzesi et al. 2007</ref>).</p><p>X-ray diffraction from single muscle fibres can overcome limitation (i), but not (ii), because of the low signal-to-noise ratio of the X-ray reflections of interest from this preparation. We have therefore used whole sartorius muscles of R. esculenta (sarcomere length ß2.15 μm, temperature 4°C) to measure the spacing changes of both the actin-based meridional A13 reflection associated with the 2.73 nm axial repeat of the actin monomers and the higher-order myosin-based meridional reflections M11 and M15 produced by rapid length changes during isometric contraction. The force per CSA was determined using the wet weight of the muscle, and checked by parallel measurements of the force per CSA in single fibres from fast skeletal muscles of the same batch of frogs. We found that both filaments exhibit a linear elasticity for forces &gt;0.4T 0 , and their cumulative compliance is consistent with that determined using recent stiffness measurements on single muscle fibres <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fusi et al. 2014)</ref>. From the mean of these measurements a cross-bridge compliance of 0.37 nm pN -1 can be calculated, which is not significantly different from the compliance of the myosin head as determined by modelling the effect on the intensity of the M3 reflection of length oscillations imposed on a fibre in rigor <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dobbie et al. 1998)</ref>. This excludes any significant contribution of S2 to cross-bridge compliance. Such a small cross-bridge compliance indicates that the isometric force is generated through an early sub-step of the 11 nm working stroke.</p></div>

Six frogs were used for these experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protocol and data collection</head><p>Sartorius muscles were dissected and mounted at rest length in a thermo-regulated aluminium/perspex trough containing Ringer solution (115 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl 2 , 3 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.1) at 4°C and bubbled with oxygen (99.9%). The trough was then mounted vertically at beamline ID02 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France), which provided up to 6 × 10 13 photons s -1 at 0.1 nm wavelength in a beam of size ß300 μm (horizontal, full width at half maximum (FWHM)) and 150-250 μm (vertical) at the sample. Electrical stimuli were delivered by platinum strips running parallel to the muscle on either side at a frequency adequate to elicit fused tetani. The length of the muscles was adjusted to that at which isometric tetanic force was maximum (L 0 , corresponding to ß2.15 μm sarcomere length). The length and force were measured/controlled using a muscle lever system type 300 C (Aurora Scientific, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada), driven by the computer used for data collection. Length changes of different amplitudes (-2 to +1% L 0 , negative for releases), complete in 3-4 ms, were superimposed on otherwise isometric contractions and reversed after 8 ms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>A fast electromagnetic shutter (Laser Products, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used to generate 1 ms windows to collect X-ray patterns at the tetanus plateau, just before the length change cycle, or at the end of the first step, when the force change had attained its maximum value (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>). To accumulate photons, three cycles were repeated at intervals of 100 ms (releases) or 75 ms (stretches), to allow the isometric force value to be recovered. Three 1 ms exposure windows were also used to record patterns from the muscle at rest. The muscle was axially shifted by 200 μm between exposures to spread the radiation dose over a larger area and reduce radiation damage, which became evident as the appearance of resting features in diffraction patterns recorded during a tetanus. X-ray collection was repeated for a total of 9 ms exposure for each condition, for each of the five muscles used. X-ray diffraction patterns were collected with a high sensitivity fibre-optically coupled CCD detector (FReLoN) with active area 100 × 100 mm 2 , 2048 × 2048 pixels <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sztucki et al. 2010)</ref>, mounted 1.8 m from the muscle.</p><p>In whole muscle the CSA can be calculated from length L 0 and wet weight W w , according to the formula W w /(ρ•L 0 ) (where ρ = 1.06 g cm -3 is the density of the muscle). The average force per CSA of the muscles calculated in this way was 205 ± 29 kPa. L 0 must be corrected by a factor that takes into account the shape of the muscle. In sartorius muscle the average fibre length is about 5-10% less than the overall length of the muscle between tendons <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Close, 1972)</ref>, so the corrected force per CSA would be 184-195 kPa. The force at the plateau of the isometric tetanus at the same temperature and sarcomere length was also determined in single fibres isolated from the tibialis anterior muscle of frogs from the same batch, a preparation in which CSA can be determined directly under the microscope by measuring the width and the height of the fibre. The force per CSA in these fibres was 183 ± 6 kPa, in good agreement with the value calculated for the muscles.</p><p>Because of the uncertainties about the correction factor for muscle shape, the value of force per CSA from the single fibres was used for the calculation of compliance in SI units described below.</p><p>Data analysis. X-ray diffraction data were analysed using Fit2D (A. Hammersley, ESRF) and Sigmaplot (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL). For each of the five muscles two-dimensional patterns were collected at rest and during isometric contraction just before each step and at each level of force attained at the end of the step. The patterns were then centred and aligned using the M3 reflections along the meridional axis on either side of the equatorial axis (perpendicular to the meridian), and then mirrored across both axes. The distribution of diffracted intensity along the meridional axis was calculated by integrating from 0.012 nm -1 on either side of the meridian for the myosin-based reflections, and 0.025 nm -1 for the A13 actin-based reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bordas et al. 1999)</ref>. The background intensity distribution was fitted using a smooth convex hull algorithm and subtracted. The intensity and spacing for each reflection were determined from a Gaussian fit on the pixels with more than half the counts of that with the maximum intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Huxley et al. 1994)</ref>.</p><p>All data are expressed as mean ± SEM.</p><p>Determination of filament compliance from X-ray spacing changes. The compliances of the thin and thick filaments were calculated from the spacing changes of the actinand myosin-based reflections, respectively, taking into account the local force changes in the filament. The compliance per unit length of the thick filament (c M ) was determined from the average spacing changes of the M11 and M15 myosin-based reflections, considering that in the region from which these reflections originate, from the end of the bare zone to the end of the thick filament <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Oshima et al. 2007)</ref>, the average isometric force is 0.5T 0 . These two reflections were selected from all the meridional myosin-based reflections recorded here, for two reasons: (i) they are the farthest from the centre of the pattern, and thus the relative error on their spacing measurements is the lowest; (ii) the possible influence of the attached myosin heads on M11 and M15 is the lowest, as indicated by the smaller intensity change following a length step (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>). The compliance per unit length of the thin filament (c A ) was calculated from the spacing changes of the A13 reflection. This reflection originates from the region of the thin filament J Physiol 592.17</p><p>from the Z-line to the beginning of overlap with thick filaments (0.275 μm long at 2.15 μm sarcomere length), in which the isometric force is T 0 , from the overlap region (0.700 μm long), in which the average isometric force is 0.5T 0 , and from the short region (0.025 μm at 2.15 μm sarcomere length) beyond the overlap zone towards M-line, in which force is zero. Thus, the average isometric force in the thin filament to be used for calculating its compliance is (0.275 + 0.700/2) = 0.625T 0 . The observed 92% increase in intensity of the A13 reflection (I A13 ) from rest to the tetanus plateau was taken into account as follows. Let L 1 and L 2 be the non-overlap and overlap regions of the thin filament, respectively, and A and B be the intensity contribution per unit length of the thin filament from the regions with no attached heads and from those with attached heads, respectively.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Compliances of the thin and thick filaments</head><p>Filament compliances were measured by imposing step length changes ( L) of different amplitudes (-2 to +1% of muscle length, L 0 ) complete in 3-4 ms at the plateau of an otherwise isometric contraction. The length change was reversed after 8 ms, and three cycles of steps were imposed in each tetanus; the three equivalent time frames were added to improve the signal to noise ratio. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2A</ref> shows the force response (upper trace) to a cycle starting with a release of ß1.1% L 0 (lower trace). The force drops to a minimum during the release and overshoots the plateau value after the subsequent stretch, but recovers the plateau value before the next cycle. The middle trace shows the 1 ms X-ray exposure when the release has attained the set value, and the force is at a minimum. The responses to a cycle starting with a stretch of ß1.1% L 0 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2B</ref>. The time of the 1 ms X-ray exposure corresponds to the time at which the stretch has just attained the set value. The force at the end of the length step has a non-linear dependence on step size (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2C</ref>), due to the increase in both the tendon compliance and the rate of cross-bridge detachment at low force (see Discussion).</p><p>The intensities of the 3rd order myosin-based reflection (I M3 , violet), the 6th (I M6 , blue), the 9th (I M9 , green), the 11th (I M11 , red) and the 15th (I M15 , black) at the end of length steps of different sizes are plotted against the force at the end of the step in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>. I M3 reduces for both releases and stretches, as shown previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Huxley et al. 1983</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Huxley et al. , 2006;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Irving et al. 2000)</ref>, in contrast to the intensities of the higher-order reflections, which increase following a release and decrease following a stretch. For example, following the 1.1% L 0 release, force falls to ca. 100 kPa (ß0.5 T 0 ), I M6 increases by 50%, I M9 increases by 25%, and I M11 and I M15 increase by only 10%. Thus, a mechanical manoeuvre that is expected to change the axial mass distribution of the attached myosin heads, as demonstrated by the I M3 changes, is progressively less effective in changing the intensities of the higher order reflections. This is expected if the higher order reflections have a progressively smaller relative contribution from the axial periodicity of the myosin heads and a correspondingly larger contribution from that of the thick filament backbone <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Huxley et al. 2006)</ref>. Moreover, in isolated muscle fibres, I M6 during isometric contraction is independent of the overlap between thick and thin filaments, in contrast to I M3 which is proportional to filament overlap <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Reconditi et al. 2014)</ref>. However, I M6 appears to be more sensitive to applied length changes, and to the number of attached myosin heads, in whole muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Huxley et al. 2006</ref>) than in single fibre experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Reconditi et al. 2004)</ref>. Finally, note that the M9 is not detectable at rest, and its intensity increase following step releases is larger than that of the M11 and M15, which were therefore selected as the most suitable for estimating the thick filament compliance.</p><p>The intensity of the 13th order actin-based reflection (I A13 ), corresponding to the 2.73 nm periodicity of the actin monomers along the thin filaments, showed relatively small changes following length steps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>). I A13 increases following a release and becomes about 20% higher for the 1.1% L 0 release associated with a force decrease to 100 kPa (ß 0.   enhances the 2.73 nm periodicity. This effect is mainly due to the CD of S1 sampling the repeat of the actin monomers, with little contribution from the LCD, which partially retains the thick filament periodicity. Thus, the spacing of the A13 reflection (S A13 ) is not significantly influenced by the compliance of the thick filament (see Appendix A), and S A13 gives a reliable measure of thin filament periodicity both during isometric contraction and following length steps.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">T/T 0 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 T/T 0 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 T/T 0 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 B C D</formula><p>The spacings of the higher order myosin-based reflections (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>) and the actin-based A13 reflection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref>) increase on stretch and decrease on release, with a dependence on the force at the end of the length step (T) that, for forces &gt;100 kPa (or 0.5 T 0 ), is well fitted by a straight line. The slopes of the linear part of the relationships are similar for S A13 (0.15 ± 0.02%/T 0 or 0.80 ± 0.11%/MPa) and the mean of S M11 and S M15 (0.16 ± 0.01%/T 0 or 0.88 ± 0.09%/MPa) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). At forces &lt; 0.5T 0 the relationships show a downward deviation, i.e. the spacing-force relationship deviates from linearity in this region. A similar non-linearity was reported previously for S M6 measured in single fibres a few milliseconds after a stepwise drop in force from T 0 (see supplementary fig. <ref type="figure">S1C</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Piazzesi et al. (2007)</ref>). At this time myosin heads that were attached during isometric contraction start to detach at a rate that is faster at lower forces or following larger releases <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Reconditi et al. 2004</ref>). In the present experiments the length step takes ß4 ms, and force responses for large releases are probably contaminated by head detachment. The non-linearity of the reduction in spacing can be explained by an increase in the number of detached heads at forces &lt; 0.5T 0 , assuming that the same process that is responsible for the 1.5% smaller spacing at rest can take place. Detachment of myosin heads also contributes to the non-linearity of the T-L relationship in this force range (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2C</ref>).</p><p>The compliances of the thick and thin filaments can be derived from the spacing changes of the associated reflections, taking into account the average force in the region of the filaments that contributes to the reflections and the fact that the increase in the intensity of the A13 reflection on activation is probably associated with the filament overlap region (see Methods).

I M3 is sensitive to axial movements of the myosin heads and can be used as an independent tool to measure their compliance, provided that the mechanical protocol isolates the elastic response of attached myosin heads from changes in their number or conformational disorder, which also would affect I M3 . This condition is realised when high frequency oscillations are applied to single muscle fibres in the absence of ATP (in rigor), as all the heads are attached to actin and respond elastically to the perturbation. In this case, I M3 changes can be interpreted in terms of changes of the mass projection accompanying the axial displacement ( z) of the head-rod junction relative to the actin-attached CD, using the crystallographic structure of the myosin head <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rayment et al. 1993b</ref>).

The increase in I M3 during the stretch phase of the oscillation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>) is explained by tilting of the LCDs towards the perpendicular to the filament axis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The elasticity of the thick and thin filaments</p><p>In this study the compliances of the thick and thin filaments in active muscle have been determined using time-resolved X-ray diffraction from whole muscle of R. esculenta to measure the spacing changes of the high order myosin-and actin-based meridional reflections in response to rapid length changes imposed during isometric contraction. Measurements of filament compliance using length perturbations in whole muscle have several limitations. Tendons introduce a series compliance that varies between the fibres of each muscle and is on average considerably larger than that of isolated fibres. This is evident from the abscissa intercept of the linear extrapolation from the high force points in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2C</ref>, which is ß0.02L 0 (almost four times larger than that in isolated fibres). Moreover, the frequency response of the actuator used for whole muscle mechanics limits the rise time of the step to 3-4 ms. Consequently, the force change at the end of such a step is reduced, as it is a mixture of three phases <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Huxley &amp; Simmons, 1971</ref>): the elastic response (phase 1), the quick force recovery due to the working stroke in the myosin heads (phase 2) and the ensuing detachment from actin (phase 3). The contribution of phases 2 and 3 is larger for larger releases because the rate constants of these phases increase with the size of the release and the reduction of force <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ford et al. 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr">Piazzesi et al. 2002a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Reconditi et al. 2004</ref>). This explains the deviation from a straight line of the T-L relationship in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2C</ref>, which is particularly marked for the largest release.</p><p>The relationship between the spacing changes of the actin-and myosin-based reflections and force (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref> and <ref type="figure">D</ref>) is also markedly non-linear at forces &lt;100 kPa (ß 0.5T 0 ), associated with the largest releases. The force dependence of S M6 (blue circles) is similar to that measured in single muscle fibres during phase 3 of the velocity transient following a force drop from T 0 (blue crosses from fig. <ref type="figure">S1C</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Piazzesi et al. 2007</ref>). Phase 3 marks the time when myosin heads that were originally attached to actin have gone through the working stroke and detach at a rate that is faster at lower loads <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Reconditi et al. 2004</ref>). We conclude that the apparent deviation from linear elastic behaviour of the thick and thin filaments at loads below 0.5T 0 is a consequence of the detachment of myosin heads, and is likely to be due to the same mechanism as that responsible for the lower spacings observed in resting muscles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref> and D, triangles, and see below). The changes in S A13 , S M11 and S M15 measured 3-4 ms after the start of the length change at forces &gt;0.5 are much less influenced by detachment, and indicate the elasticity of the thin and thick filaments, respectively. The compliances per unit length of thin (c A ) and thick (c M ) filaments calculated from the slopes of the spacing/force relationships in this region of force are 14.3 ± 1.9 and 17.5 ± 1.7 nm MPa -1 μm -1 , respectively. The total equivalent filament compliance (C f ) is 13.1 ± 1.2 nm MPa -1 , a value in quite good agreement with the estimates from mechanical experiments in single muscle fibres <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Piazzesi et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Fusi et al. 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fusi et al. , 2014))</ref>.</p></div>

A force-dependent structural transition, associated with detachment of cross-bridges on the millisecond time scale at forces &lt;0.5T 0 , is likely to be responsible for the non-linear response of the thin filament in these conditions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The source of the cross-bridge compliance and the mechanism of force generation</head><p>During 3 kHz oscillations imposed on a muscle fibre in rigor, the myosin cross-bridges remain attached to actin and undergo cyclical elastic distortions that appear as changes in the intensity of the M3 reflection. Using the crystallographic structure of the myosin head (S1), the I M3 changes can be interpreted in terms of tilting of the LCD that accompanies the axial displacement ( z) of the S1-S2 junction relative to the actin-attached CD of the myosin head during the elastic response (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This analysis gives an estimate of the compliance of the single myosin head (C S1 ) of 0.38 ± 0.06 nm pN -1 . The compliance C cb of the myosin cross-bridge (i.e. the S1 head plus the S2 domain that joins the head to the thick filament), determined by integrating X-ray and mechanical measurements in contracting fibres, was 0.37 ± 0.12 nm pN -1 . Thus, the value of the compliance of S 2 (C S2 = C cb -C S1 ) determined from the structural simulation of I M3 changes in rigor is -0.01 ± 0.13 nm pN -1 and not significantly different from zero, providing evidence that the elastic distortion of the myosin head accounts for the entire cross-bridge compliance.</p><p>This analysis is based on the assumption that the S2 domains of all the cross-bridges exhibit linear elasticity. The presence of a fraction of cross-bridges with a slack S2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kaya &amp; Higuchi, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2013)</ref> in our rigor experiments is likely to be prevented by the procedure used for rigor induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dobbie et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Linari et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Piazzesi et al. 2007)</ref>. Moreover, myosin cross-bridges are unlikely to have become slack during the shortening phase of the rigor oscillations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dobbie et al. 1998)</ref> because the oscillations were superimposed on a steady force of ß0.5T 0 . A further argument against the presence of slack S2 in some cross-bridges in the conditions of our experiments is that it would have led to an overestimate of C cb from mechanical measurements but an underestimate of C S1 (because not all heads contribute to the observed I M3 changes during the oscillations in rigor), which, given the present result that C cb and C S1 have the same value, could only occur if S2 had a negative compliance.</p><p>Our conclusion that the compliance of S2 is negligible compared with that of S1 confirms that of earlier studies on the I M3 changes following step stretches and releases superimposed on isometric contraction in single muscle fibres <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Irving et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Piazzesi et al. 2002b</ref>) and is consistent with the coiled-coil structure of S2, which indicates a stretching stiffness of 60-80 pN nm -1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adamovic et al. 2008</ref>), more than one order of magnitude larger than that found for the myosin head. The very low compliance of S2 makes even more unlikely the idea of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Knupp et al. (2009)</ref> that force can be generated by stochastic 11 nm lever arm tiltings in isometric conditions.</p><p>The source of the compliance within the myosin head cannot be determined by X-ray diffraction studies of muscle fibres. Calculation of the flexural rigidity of the LCD provides an estimate of its stiffness in the expected range (2 pN nm -1 ; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Howard &amp; Spudich, 1996)</ref> to account for the head compliance. However, the recent finding that mutations in the β isoform of the myosin heavy chain located in the converter region of the myosin head modulate the compliance of the cross-bridge <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Seebohm et al. 2009)</ref> gives strong support to the idea that the compliance is concentrated in the converter region within the head <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Houdusse et al. 2000)</ref>. The cross-bridge stiffness found here, (1/C cb = ) 2.7 ± 0.9 pN nm -1 , is consistent with values reported in previous studies using single fibre mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Decostre et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Piazzesi et al. 2007</ref>) and solidifies the energetics-based argument that isometric force is generated by a structural change in the actin-attached myosin heads that is a small fraction of the crystallographic working stroke. This conclusion supports the X-ray diffraction evidence that the conformational dispersion of attached myosin heads in isometric contraction is limited to a narrow distribution of LCD angles corresponding to an early sub-step of the working stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Irving et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Reconditi et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Huxley et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Piazzesi et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A kinetic model of the working stroke in which actin-attached myosin heads are distributed between five sub-states (m1-m5), separated by 2.75 nm steps, has been recently put forward to explain the kinetics of the early phases of the response to step changes in length or force <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Linari et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Piazzesi et al. 2014)</ref>. According to that model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, middle panel), only states m1, m2 and m3 are populated in isometric contraction, with m1 and m2 states sharing the larger fractional occupancy, to account for an average strain of 1.7 nm. Larger degrees of LCD tilting occur following step releases or a reduction of the load below T 0 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>, lower panel).</p><p>The model provides an independent estimate of the filament compliance as the value that is required to reproduce the rate of quick force recovery following a step release, given rate functions obtained by fitting the early isotonic shortening following a stepwise drop in force. This estimate of filament compliance was 12.1-13.2 nm MPa -1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Piazzesi et al. 2014)</ref>, in good agreement with the present results. This value was obtained by determining the compliance that is required to fit the rate of quick force recovery following a step release with the rate functions for state transitions selected to fit the early isotonic shortening following a stepwise drop in force.</p><p>If completion of the ATP hydrolysis cycle is tightly coupled to the 11 nm tilting of the LCD, the conclusion in this work that the high stiffness prevents such tilting in isometric contraction appears to be inconsistent with the relatively high isometric rate of ATP splitting (ß1/4 of the maximum rate observed during shortening; <ref type="bibr">Woledge et al. 1985 and references therein)</ref>. The apparent contradiction is resolved if the biochemical and mechanical cycles are not tightly coupled. This view is supported by recent demonstrations that (i) in isometric contraction orthophosphate (Pi) can also be released from the catalytic site of the myosin head following early detachment of the force-generating cross-bridge <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Caremani et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Linari et al. 2010</ref>) and (ii) during shortening the release of hydrolysis products (Pi and ADP) and the termination of the ATPase cycle can occur at any stage of the working stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caremani et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Relationship to in vitro structural and mechanical studies X-ray crystallographic and electron microscopy studies on the structural correlates of the four relevant states of the myosin-actin ATPase cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Lymn &amp; Taylor, 1971</ref>) have been successful in defining two main structural states (the pre-working stroke state and the rigor-like state at the end of the working stroke). In the pre-working stroke state the actin binding cleft is open, the nucleotide binding pocket is closed and contains the hydrolysis products Pi and ADP, and the LCD is in the 'up' conformation; in the rigor-like state the actin binding cleft is closed, the nucleotide binding pocket is open, the catalytic site has released the hydrolysis products and the LCD is in the 'down' conformation. The transition from the up to the down conformation accounts for the 11 nm working stroke <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rayment et al. 1993b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dominguez et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Geeves &amp; Holmes, 2005)</ref>. Thus, release of the ATP hydrolysis products, ADP and Pi, produces a stroke of the same size as that observed in situ when the motor load is suddenly reduced to zero <ref type="bibr">(Piazzesi et al. 2002a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Reconditi et al. 2004)</ref>. Intermediate states of the actin-attached myosin head under strain, such as those depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> on the basis of mechanical and structural studies in situ, cannot be reproduced in crystallographic studies of myosin head fragments in the absence of actin.</p><p>The molecular flexibility of S1 in the ATP-free state has recently been detected by negative stain electron microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Billington et al. 2014)</ref>. The large range of angles between the LCD and the CD in these images was interpreted in terms of an apparent stiffness of 0.37 pN nm -1 , one order of magnitude smaller than that measured in situ when the CD is attached to actin. Although the results of this electron microscopy study are consistent with flexibility within the myosin head near the junction between the CD and the LCD in a given nucleotide state, it also demonstrates the limits of current in vitro structural techniques to detect the states of the actin-attached myosin head under strain.</p><p>The orientation of the LCD, determined in situ by attaching fluorescent probes to light chains in skinned muscle fibres, shows in general a quite broad distribution in isometric contraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baker et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burghardt et al. 2011)</ref>. The association of such a broad distribution with actin-attached myosin heads would not be consistent with a motor stiffness of ß3 pN nm -1 according to the energetics argument above, but is more likely to be associated with the large fraction of detached heads during isometric contraction. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy evidence that detachment of up to 50% of rigor heads in skinned fibres by ATP analogues was accompanied by only a small reduction in the fibre stiffness <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Pate &amp; Cooke, 1988)</ref> was interpreted as showing that only one of the two attached heads in each myosin molecule J Physiol 592.17 is stiff. However, when the contribution of filament and series compliance is taken into account, the electron paramagnetic resonance and stiffness data are consistent with the conclusion that the stiffness of a myosin with two attached heads is twice that of a single head <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Linari et al. 2007)</ref>. This further supports the X-ray evidence reported here that the source of elasticity of the myosin motor is in the head and not in S2.</p><p>Current single-molecule techniques using laser trapping are also unable to resolve the relevant structural and mechanical states of skeletal muscle myosin II, as this motor protein is designed to work in an ensemble and has evolved towards very short-lived interactions with actin, so that it is detached from actin for most of the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Single actin-myosin interactions can be detected if their lifetime is increased by reducing ATP concentration down to a few tens of micromolar. In this way single working strokes of 5-10 nm at low load have been measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Finer et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Molloy et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Tyska et al. 1999)</ref>. However, due to the large series compliance intrinsic to these single molecule mechanical measurements, neither the high load stroke nor the isometric force have been reliably measured for single molecules of myosin II. The reported values of isometric force are in general smaller (0.5-3 pN) than the values determined with fibre mechanics and reported here. A force of 9 pN (80% larger than that from fibre mechanics) was measured by simulating nominally isometric conditions using a sophisticated dynamic force feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Takagi et al. 2006)</ref>. However, the time constant of the feedback was too large to prevent transient shortening, so that the original actin filament position was recovered by applying a stretch. A faster force feedback has recently been realised <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Capitanio et al. 2012</ref>) that allows the force-generating event to be resolved within the first millisecond following the attachment. In this way, in agreement with fibre mechanics <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Piazzesi et al. 2007)</ref>, the working stroke of a single interaction has been found to be ß5 nm independently of the load. However, neither of these experiments directly determined the size of the stroke that generates the isometric force, and the necessity to keep the ATP concentration low prevented measurement of the interaction kinetics under physiological conditions. Using a preparation in which myosin II molecules are part of a synthetic co-filament <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kaya &amp; Higuchi, 2010</ref>) and a quantum dot on the actin filament, it has been possible to overcome the limits imposed by the compliance of the link between the actin filament and the trapped bead and to estimate the stiffness of the myosin cross-bridge in rigor. Under pulling forces comparable to those in situ, the measured stiffness was 2.6-2.9 pN nm -1 , similar to that reported here. However, also in this case, the compliance of the links prevented the measurement of the force and the strain of the myosin heads under isometric conditions.</p><p>The organisation of myosin II molecules into an ordered array of parallel elements in each half-sarcomere of the muscle fibre, combined with fast sarcomere level mechanics and X-ray diffraction, makes the cell-based approach the only one that is able to define the relationship between the force and strain in the individual myosin head domain. Integrating the data with the X-ray structural information on filament compliance from whole muscle, we define the mechanical properties of all the mechanically relevant elements of the half-sarcomere and we find that the 0.37 nm pN -1 compliance of the myosin cross-bridge is accounted for by the compliance in the head itself. The resulting high stiffness of the myosin head (ß3 pN nm -1 ) reinforces the evidence from X-ray diffraction experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Reconditi et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Huxley et al. 2006</ref>) that actin-attached myosin heads generate isometric force with a narrow distribution of LCD angles, corresponding to an early sub-step of the crystallographic working stroke.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix A: spacing of the A13 reflection is not sensitive to the thick filament compliance</head><p>The intensity of the actin-based A13 reflection, due to the axial 2.73 nm repeat of the actin monomers along the thin filament, almost doubles from rest to the plateau of an isometric contraction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>), probably as a consequence of the attachment of the myosin head domains to actin. In principle this could imply that the spacing changes of the A13 reflection accompanying the elastic response of the half-sarcomere depend not only on the compliance of the thin filament but also, through the cross-bridge links, on that of the thick filament. To check this possibility, we built a simplified 1D model of thin and thick filaments interacting through the attached myosin heads. In the model, the ß1000 nm long thin filament is represented by 367 actin monomers with axial periodicity 2.73 nm. The ß700 nm overlap region of one half of a thick filament is represented by 49 myosin heads facing the thin filament, the S1-S2 junctions (myosin heavy chain residue Lys843) of which have an axial periodicity of 14.56 nm, the spacing of the M3 reflection at T 0 . The CD of the heads attaches to actin monomers in the conformation defined by the electron density map of the nucleotide-free actin-S1 complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Holmes et al. 2003)</ref>. Starting from the M-line, the first head attaches to the first actin monomer at the free end of the actin filament with an orientation of its LCD (defined in Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref> by the angle θ between the vector joining the head-rod junction (Lys843, grey circle) with the fulcrum between the CD and LCD (Cys707, yellow circle) and the filament axis) of 60 deg, which corresponds to the average value for isometric contraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Irving et al. 2000)</ref>. The other heads attach to the actin monomer that gives the value of θ closest to 60 deg. The mismatch between the periodicities along the actin and the myosin filament introduces a dispersion in θ of ±8 deg, about half the ±17 deg dispersion determined experimentally <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Reconditi et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Huxley et al. 2006)</ref>. The ratio of heads to actin monomers in the model is (49/367 =) 0.13, while the ratio between heads and actin monomers in the half sarcomere is ((49•6)/(367•2) =) 0.40, and thus the model described here implies that the fraction of attached heads is 0.13/0.4 = 0.33, which is close to that reported in previous studies for isometric contraction (Park-Holohan et al. 2012, and references therein).</p><p>To test the influence of thick filament compliance on the change in the spacing of the A13 reflection following an elastic force change we assumed a rigid thin filament (c A = 0) and a compliant thick filament (c M = 3.2 nm/T 0 /μm), and simulated the effect of a force increase to T 0 . Assuming a half bare zone of ß80 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Linari et al. 2000)</ref>, the S1-S2 junction of the first head moves away from the mid-point of the thick filament by (80•0.0032 =) 0.26 nm, and the 48 segments of half-thick filament between the S1 and S2 junctions of the LCDs of the 49 heads elongate by 14.56•0.0032•(49m)/49 nm, where m = 1, 2, . . . , 48 is the order of the segment starting from that closest to the M-line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). This reflects the fact that the force on the various segments is transmitted from the end of the half-sarcomere through the cross-bridges, so the force decreases linearly along the half thick filament (black line) from T 0 at the bare zone to zero at the end farthest from the bare zone. θ for each LCD was adjusted to accommodate the shift between the S1-S2 junction and actin binding site introduced by this value of thick filament compliance.</p><p>The Fourier transform of the axial mass distribution of the actin monomers and the myosin heads in the region of the A13 reflection was calculated (i) without thick filament compliance (grey trace in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>) and (ii) The profiles are calculated as described in the text. Grey, without strain in the thick filament; black, with strain due to a force T 0 .</p><p>E. Brunello and others J Physiol 592.17</p><p>with thick filament compliance (black) produced by an increase in the half-sarcomere force of T 0 . The simulation indicates that the spacing change of the A13 reflection induced by thick filament compliance is ß0.0005%. Thus, the compliance of the thick filament has a negligible effect on the spacing of the A13 reflection, which depends solely on the compliance of the thin filament. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Reconditi et al. 2003)</ref>, in the conformation defined by the electron density map of the nucleotide-free actin-S1 complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Holmes et al. 2003)</ref>. With this constraint the tilt of the two LCDs is not independent and the distortion of the head pair can be conveniently defined by the axial displacement z of the shared S1-S2 junction relative to the CD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>), with z = 0 in the absence of strain. I M3 is calculated as the Fourier transform of the axial mass distribution of the head pair at the periodicity of the M3 reflection (14.44 nm; <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Reconditi et al. 2003)</ref> for different values of z (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>). The relationship between I M3 and z depends on the orientation of the LCDs with respect to the filament axis, expressed as the angle θ defined above, in the absence of strain. In rigor conditions at low force (&lt;0.05T 0 ) the θ values for the two LCDs of each myosin molecule are 126 and 91 deg <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Reconditi et al. 2003)</ref>, with a mean value of 108.5 deg corresponding to that for the in vitro actin-S1 complex in the absence of ATP <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Holmes et al. 2003)</ref>. When a fibre in rigor is stretched to a force of about 0.45T 0 , I M3 increases by 37% <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Reconditi et al. 2003)</ref>. From the relationship between I M3 and z (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">9</ref>), the corresponding z is ß0.8 nm (grey circle), and the two θ values become 121 and 86 deg, respectively. The average force level during the imposition of 3 kHz oscillations in rigor in the experiment in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> was 0.5T 0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dobbie et al. 1998)</ref>, corresponding to z ß0.8 nm.

B, conformations of the myosin heads attached to actin monomers (white spheres, separated by 2.73 nm) every 14.56 nm according to the model described in the text. CD are blue and LCD are red and green. Assuming that the thin filament compliance is zero, a force increase by T 0 increases the strain only in the thick filament (violet), as shown by the changes in the orientation of the LCDs (green), while the actin monomers and the CDs do not move. The arrow at the right end indicates the direction of strain and the two vertical lines measure the cumulative strain at the distal tip of the thick filament.</figDesc><graphic coords="15,137.81,64.67,344.37,187.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
