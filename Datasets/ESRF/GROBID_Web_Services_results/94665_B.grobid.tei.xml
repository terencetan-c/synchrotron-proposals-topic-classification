<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the current experiment we investigated the lattice dynamics in SmNiC 2 and NdNiC 2 by means of x-ray diffuse scattering (DS) and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS). These two compoundslike many members of the RNiC 2 family, R=rare earthdisplay a strong interplay between charge density wave (CDW) ordering and magnetism <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. More specifically, CDW order appears in SmNiC 2 (NdNiC 2 ) at 148 K (121 K) and is followed at T c = 17.5 K (T N = 17.2 K) by the ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) ordering of the rare earth moments <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. In both cases, the CDW order is strongly influenced by the onset of the magnetic ordering. The goal of the experiment was to investigate the role of the phonons in driving the CDW transition and in mediating their interplay with the different types of magnetism.</p><p>The experiment was performed at the side and main station of the ID28 beamline, using a 17.79 keV incident x-ray beam. Single crystals of SmNiC 2 and NdNiC 2 grown by argon arc melting were used for the measurements. The samples were glued on a conically shaped glass rod and placed on a standard goniometer head mount. The DS and IXS measurements were performed in the temperature regime 80 K-295 K. A liquid nitrogen cryostream was used for cooling the samples. The preliminary evaluation of the DS data was performed using the CrysAlis software.</p><p>We have started the experiment with a DS mapping of the reciprocal space of the two compounds. Selected results for NdNiC 2 are presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> which depicts the reconstructed maps of the (0.5 K L) reciprocal space plane. Intense DS signal is observed already at room temperature at q 1 = (0.5, 0.52, 0) and at q 2 = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). Upon cooling the sample, the DS signal both at q 1 and at q 2 increases strongly. This comes in agreement with earlier x-ray diffraction investigations which have identified the formation of a superstructure related to the CDW ordering with propagation vector q, as well as weaker DS signal at q 2 . Below CDW onset temperature T CDW the DS signal at q 1 collapses into focused superstructure reflections. On the other hand, the DS signal at q 2 , remains diffuse and does not evolve into satellite peaks upon further cooling. The DS data on SmNiC 2 revealed a very similar behaviour upon cooling.</p><p>Having identified the regions of interest by temperature dependent DS, we have continued our investigation with energy-resolved IXS measurements on SmNiC 2 across the reciprocal space positions of the DS signal at q 1 and q 2 in the vicinity of the (0 4 0) Bragg peak. Selected IXS spectra along the [x 4-x 0] and [x 4-x x] cuts of the reciprocal space are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. A pronounced softening of a low energy acoustic phonon branch is observed around both q 1 and q 2 . The temperature dependence of the IXS spectra indicates that the softening is complete at q 1 at the transition temperature. While the IXS measurements were done only on SmNiC 2 , the similarity of the temperature dependent DS data on the two compounds suggest a comparable phonon behaviour also on NdNiC 2 .  Unfortunately, during this remote experiment and the limited beamtime we did not have the time to explore the phonon behaviour below T c /T N . This is a very interesting issue, given that the CDW response to the magnetic ordering is different in the two systems. While in SmNiC 2 the CDW order is abruptly and completely destroyed below the onset of the ferromagnetic order, in NdNiC 2 it is gradually and only partially supressed by the antiferromagnetic order <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Future experiments will be required in order to clarify the phononic response in the magnetic states of the two compounds.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: IXS spectra of SmNiC2 recorded at 295 K from Γ = (0 4 0) along the (a) [1 -1 0] and (b) [1 -1 1] directions of the reciprocal space.
