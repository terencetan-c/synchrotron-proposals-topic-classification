<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Melting line and evolution of the structure factor of liquid Gold to 140 GPa. Experiment number: HC 2187 Beamline: ID27 Date of experiment: From: 05/11/2015 to 09/11/2015 Date of report: 17/05/2016 Shifts: 18 Local contact(s): G. Garbarino Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Gunnar Weck* Frederic Datchi* Sandra Ninet* Jean Antoine Queyroux* Report:</p><p>The goal of this experiment was to determine the melting curve and measure the liquid structure factor of Gold up to 140 GPa. Due to its exceptional chemical inertness and structural stability, gold is a widely used high-pressure standard and is an important material in many applications. The melting line of Gold has been investigated by several authors in a large-volume apparatus up to 6-7 GPa, using the change of the sample electrical resistance to detect melting. The same criteria has also been used in recent experiments using the resistively heated DAC up to 9 <ref type="bibr">[Zha]</ref> and 21 GPa <ref type="bibr">[Weir]</ref>. To our knowledge there is only one attempt to determine melting in the LHDAC, to 35 GPa <ref type="bibr">[Pippinger]</ref>. While all these melting lines roughly agree within their uncertainties below 15 GPa, there is a 200 K difference between the resistive and laser heating DAC measurements around 20 GPa. Furthermore these two works suggest very different slopes of the melting lines above 15 GPa. Finally, the high pressure evolution of liquid gold is totally unknown.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental method</head><p>Five membrane diamond anvil cells were equipped with diamond anvils with culet sizes ranging from 400m to 150m. The cells were prepared with a gold sample confined in a capsule formed by two borondoped diamond bowls. Each bowl was deposited in a pit, realized by Focussed Ion Beam, at the center of the culet of the diamond anvils. Argon was used as a pressure transmitting medium since its melting curve crosses gold's at about 40 GPa. In the first cell equipped with 300 microns culet, we increased the pressure to 40 GPa in order to melt the gold sample while keeping the argon medium solid. The capsule was then heated several times up to a maximum temperature of 3000 K, taking care to equilibrate temperature over the two sides of the sample. Thermal expansion, solid recrystallization and melting events were observed but we couldn't obtain a fully melted sample signal. We think that the bowls were damaged during the pressure increase, so that the sample was not sufficiently confined. In the second cell equipped with 400 microns culet, we heated the sample at the loading pressure (12 GPa) and we were able to obtain a liquid diffraction signal of the fully melted sample up to 35 GPa. In the third and fourth cells equipped with 150 microns culets we attempt to apply the same experimental procedure (increase the sample pressure up to 10 GPa and start the laser heating at this relatively low pressure). Unfortunately in both cells, the gasket hole has open during heating. We believe that the boron disk diameter was initially too large (40 microns) with respect to the sample cavity (55 microns) and the diamond culet (100 microns). Additionally, we observed that the bowls systematically tear due to (as measured) strong non hydrostatic conditions within the capsule. The last cell equipped with 300 microns culet was installed at the end of the experiment and we were able to measure two additional melting point (at 5 GPa and 13 GPa) before the shutdown. Preliminary results on the melting line of Gold to 35 GPa are presented on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref> and suggest a revision of the latter. Additionally a liquid diffraction signal of gold at high P-T and the pressure evolution of the main diffusion peak are presented on Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>. The high quality of these data allow to extract the S(Q) and g(r) of the liquid. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Preliminary results obtained during the last run of LTP HD-463 and HC-2187.
