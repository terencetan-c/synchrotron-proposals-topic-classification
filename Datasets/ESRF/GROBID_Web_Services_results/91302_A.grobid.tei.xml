			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Pt dehydrogenation catalysts are typically promoted with a second metal such as Ga, to form a bimetallic nanoparticles by alloying, which show improved catalytic performance. Still, this bimetallic catalyst suffers from coke formation, sintering and side reactions. In order to minimize these effects several strategies are applied: 1. Adding some CO2 in the feed, 2. Incorporating Ga in the support, 3. Overcoating the PtGa bimetallic nanoparticles with Al2O3. This proposal is meant to explore the effect of these strategies. Catalysts were prepared by wet-incipient impregnation (WI) of Pt &amp; Ga on MgAl2O4 support (HSA -100m 2 /g) and WI of Pt on a Mg(Ga)(Al)Ox hydrotalcite-like support. After reduction to induce alloy formation, these were overcoated with Al2O3 by atomic layer deposition (ALD).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>The samples for all in-situ experiments was loaded in a quartz capillary allowing to record all combined measurements. The catalysts were subjected to separate H2-TPR and CO2-TPO treatments with a temperature program from room temperature till 873K. Subsequently, isothermal cycling treatments (873 K) were performed, with periodic CO2 &amp; H2 gas switching, each cycle lasting 40 min (H2 for 20 min and CO2 for 20 min). Structural changes occurring during separate treatments were monitored by XAS and SAXS. While in-situ XAS gives information about the chemical state and short range order, the SAXS probes the particle size and inter-particle distance. For all samples, the experiments as in Error! Reference source not found. have been conducted at the Pt LIII-edge and for samples PtGa/MgAl2O4 and Al2O3/PtGa/MgAl2O4 equally at the Ga K-edge: Ramp rate 20 o C/min Ramp rate 20 o C/min Change gas flows 20 min 20 min 650 o C Ramp rate 20 o C/min Ramp rate 20 o C/min H 2 TPR CO 2 TPO 650 o C 10 min Ramp rate 20 o C/min H 2 TPR + CO 2 TPO Ramp rate 20 o C/min 10 min 4 Cycles 1 Cycle</p><p>with both XANES and EXAFS. The XAS was recorded using a photodiode, while a Pilatus detector measured the scattered X-ray intensity. The SAXS and XAS measurements were synchronized such that SAXS was triggered to measure every time the energy was at 11.4keV while measuring at the Pt-edge.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">H2-TPR, CO2-TPO, H2-CO2 cycling: PtGa/MgAl2O4 at the Pt LIII edge, XANES</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the XANES spectra at the Pt edge. All the spectra are the final ones obtained at the end of each treatment. There is a clear reduction during TPR and a small hint of increase in white line intensity after CO2-TPO, which is an occurrence not expected for Pt catalysts when present without any promoters. This indicates that Ga plays a role for this CO2-oxidation to take place. Maybe it is present on the surface of the Pt as an oxide and thus contributes to this signal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">H2-TPR, CO2-TPO, H2-CO2 cycling: PtGa/MgAl2O4 at the Pt LIII edge, EXAFS</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the R-space signal of the sample measured at room temperature subsequent to every treatment. The reduction of the oxide is evident. Upon CO2-oxidation there are small changes in the first neighbour peaks and there is a slight change in the sample upon CO2/H2 cycling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">SAXS measurements during the treatments for PtGa/MgAl2O4</head><p>SAXS was measured in transmission for all the experiments that were performed in order to track the evolution of the particle size. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the SAXS results after the respective treatments for the PtGa sample. The support contribution has been subtracted to obtain the contributions from the metals present. There are some changes evident, different intensity level and crossing of scattering curves, which will be modelled to get detailed results in terms of particle size and interparticle distance. SAXS was measured for MgAl2O4, Pt/MgAl2O4, Pt/Mg(Ga)(Al)O4 and PtGa/MgAl2O4, as well as Al2O3/Pt/MgAl2O4, Al2O3/PtGa/MgAl2O4 and Al2O3/PtGa/Mg(Ga)(Al)O4. This was done so that the contribution from each component can be quantified by subtracting each of the other components as a background.   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding</head><p>A nice set of XAS data has been collected on several PtGa/MgAl2O4 [Mg(Ga)(Al)O] samples both at the Pt and Ga edge under different conditions (reduction, CO2-oxidation and CO2/H2 cycling). This will allow for several comparisons to be made, e.g. evolution of particle size, effect of Al2O3 overcoat on particle size, etc. Some differences already appear from a first comparison of XANES and R-space spectra. This will be further examined by modelling of these data. In addition, a first use of combined in situ XAS-SAXS was made and evaluated in collaboration with beam line scientist A. Longo.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: In-situ XANES/XAS/SAXS measurements conducted during different treatments XANES was measured during all temperature program treatments and during the cycling measurements, while EXAFS was recorded close to room temperature after cool down.
