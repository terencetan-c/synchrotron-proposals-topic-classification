<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The work done was aiming to solve the structure of the main ATPase of the type IVb secretion system, DotB. This protein is powering the secretion system that allows some intracellular bacterial pathogens to secrete virulent proteins into the cytoplasm of the host cell, leading to deseases, such as Legionnaire's disease or Q fewer.</p><p>On the 2 nd of December 2016, 16 crystals of the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis DotB homologue were screened on ID23-1. 2 full datasets were collected, improving the working resolution from 3.4 to 3.0 Å Those session helped us to improve crystallization conditions and further better datasets were collected in other facilities for both homologues. We are now solving their structures.</p></div>		</body>
