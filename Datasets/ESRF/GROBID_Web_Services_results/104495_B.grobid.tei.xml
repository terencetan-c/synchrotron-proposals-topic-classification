<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Considering the exsolution process in ceria doped with transition metals -combining experiment with DFT calculations A wide set of ceramic samples has been synthesized via the Pechini method. The following compositions with single metal have been given:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0"> Ce0.9Co0.1O2-δ  Ce0.9Cu0.1O2-δ  Ce0.9Fe0.1O2-δ  Ce0.9Ni0.1O2-δ  Ce0.9Mn0.1O2-δ  CeO2-δ  Ce0.8Co0.2O2-δ  Ce0.8Cu0.2O2-δ  Ce0.8Fe0.2O2-δ  Ce0.8Ni0.2O2-δ  Ce0.8Mn0.2O2-δ and bimetallic compositions:  Ce0.8Ni0.1Co0.1O2-δ  Ce0.8Ni0.1Cu0.1O2-δ  Ce0.8Ni0.1Fe0.1O2-δ  Ce0.8Co0.1Fe0.1O2-δ</formula><p>The samples were in a powder form in both as-prepared and reduced state. The reduction of as-preapred powders was performed in home laboratory in hydrogen atmosphere for 10h at 900C, 1000C and 1100C.</p><p>The masurements at LISA beamline were performed in the transmission and fluorescence modes at 80K (cooled down with liquid nitrogen). The proper weight amount of particular powders was mixed with celulose and pressed into pellets before the analysis. The measurements were taken at the near-edge and in the extended range spectra (up to 500 eV above the edge energy). The K-edges of transition metals were colleced, as well as both CeK and CeL3 edges were measured for comparision.</p><p>The examplary figures presenting the obtained results are given below: Fig.2: CeL3-edge XANES spectra of ceria doped with Cu (left) and Fe (right) samples in both as-prepared and reduced states. Also the CeL3-edge XANES plot of Ce(NO3)3 is given for comparison. Fig.3: CeL3-edge XANES spectra of ceria doped with Mn (left) and Ni (right) samples in both as-prepared and reduced states. Also the CeL3-edge XANES plot of Ce(NO3)3 is given for comparison. Fig.4: Co K-edge (left) and Cu K-edge (right) XANES spectra of ceria with Co or Cu dopants in both as-prepared and reduced states (after reduction at 900, 1000 or 1100C in H2).  The metallic dopants were added to ceria fluorite structure in order to perform the exsolution process of metallic nanoparticles on the surface of the host material in reducing conditions. However, the reducibility of formed compounds strongly depends on both the type and amount of dopants, as well as the temperature of the reduction process.</p><p>The CeL3-edge XANES spectra of all analyzed samples (Figs 1, 2 and 3) indicate a partial reduction of cerium from Ce 4+ to Ce 3+ oxidation state. However, among them, the Fe-doped samples differ the most significantly from each other and seem to be the most prone to reduction. Particularly the Ce0.8Fe0.2O2-δ compound after reduction at 1000C in H2 shows the highest content of Ce 3+ , the same as present in the Ce(NO3)3 reference nitrate. Moreover, the pre-edge behaviour of different Fe-doped compounds allows distinguishing a reduction efficiency depending on the amount of introduced metal as well as the temperature of reduction.</p><p>The K-edge XANES spectra of all analyzed samples (Figs 4, 5 and 6) confirm that a high-temperature reduction in hydrogen shifted the edge position towards lower energies than it was observed for as-prepared samples. It's a consequence of a decreased oxidation state of particular metals. The most significant shift was found for Fecontaining samples. Moreover, the XANES spectra of Fe-doped compounds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> left) are the most differential when compared to the other investigated compounds. It seems that metals other than iron are in a partially reduced state even in as-prepared samples, in order to provide the electroneutrality condition. Thus the edge shift to lower energies after a high-temperature reduction in H2 is not so significant. In the case of Fe-doped samples iron is sensitive to reduction depending on various factors: local surroundings of aother atoms (composition), temperature, and even time of reduction. Therefore these XANES spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> left) differ the most from each other. The same tendency can be observed in the case of the pre-edge behaviour.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>email: alessandro.puri@esrf.fr) Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Beata Bochentyn, Faculty of Applied Physics and Mathematics, Gdańsk University of Technology, 80-233 Gdańsk, ul.
