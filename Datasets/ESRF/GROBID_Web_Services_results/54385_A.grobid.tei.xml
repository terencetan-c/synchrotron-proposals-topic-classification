<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Start of report in free format</head><p>Summary of diffuse scattering experiments carried out with ID28 side station.</p><p>1. Elasticity measurements from thermal diffuse scattering.</p><p>The elasticity tensor, i.e. the full set of elastic stiffness coefficients, is the fundamental quantity required for the description of the elastic properties of crystalline materials. Accurate measurements of the elasticity tensor are a prerequisite for the interpretation of seismological observations, which provide insight into the composition, temperature and pressure of Earth's interior. In condensed matter physics, elastic properties are important in the study of phase transitions in systems with pronounced interaction of phonons with other quasi-particles. Such interaction may include electronphonon coupling in superconductors or spin-phonon coupling in low dimensional spin systems.</p><p>Researchers from the University of Geneva, Paul Scherrer Institute and the ESRF have shown in their article published in Physical Review Letters that the full elasticity tensor can be determined by highprecision measurements of thermal diffuse scattering in a single crystal <ref type="bibr">[B. Wehinger et al, PRL 118, 035502 (2017)</ref>]. Thermal diffuse scattering is due to the vibrations of atoms around their equilibrium positions. In the vicinity of Bragg reflections, the measured intensities are mainly due to scattering of x-rays by acoustic phonons and hence the elasticity tensor can be extracted by an analysis of the scattering intensities. In their paper, the investigated benchmark materials were high-quality single crystals of magnesium oxide and calcite. Here we show that ID28 side station can be used to carry out similar surveys of elastic properties.</p><p>We have investigated elastic stiffness coefficients of a natural single crystal of strontium sulfate SrSO 4.</p><p>During measurements, the sample is rotated in small angular steps of only 0.1 degrees with 1 second exposure times, in order to accurately measure the weak diffuse scattering. Measurements were taken at various temperatures. The data treatment required the adaption of a novel analysis technique and the development of an appropriate software package, which allows the precise reconstruction of diffuse scattering. The software simultaneously fits approximately 40 individual intensity data by taking into account the exact scattering geometry and symmetry of the crystal. The full formalism of the fitting procedure will be described in detail in a forthcoming publication <ref type="bibr">(Girard, A., Stekiel, M., Morgenroth, W., Wehinger, B., Mirone, A., Bosak, A. and Winkler, B.</ref>, Elastic tensor of SrSO4 from thermal diffuse scattering. In prep.).</p><p>We first considered the determination of the elastic constants from thermal diffuse scattering measured at a single temperature. For the fit, scattering intensities in the proximity of the 40 most intense Bragg reflections were considered. Experimental scattering intensities and calculated thermal diffuse scattering intensities from the fitted elastic constants are compared in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, top panel for the 220 reflection. The corresponding cij are summarized in table <ref type="table">1</ref> along with the values measured from ultrasound, values obtained from DFT calculations, and the experimental bulk modulus from high pressure diffraction measurements. Despite an apparent agreement of experimental and calculated scattering intensities, most of the obtained elastic coefficients strongly differ from the theoretical values. This is due to a strong elastic scattering (Huang scattering) arising from either disorder or bad surface state. The problem of Huang scattering in imperfect crystals can be overcome if measurements are taken at slightly different temperatures. This strategy further allows to separate the inelastic contribution from elastic scattering that show different temperature behaviors. The bottom panel of Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the calculated TDS and the subtraction of diffuse intensities measured at 90 K and 130 K.</p><p>The corresponding cij are summarized in table 1. In particular, the bulk modulus derived from the elastic stiffness tensor agrees better with the result obtained by high pressure measurements and by DFT calculations, and the cij from the multi-temperature analysis are generally in good agreement with values obtained from ultrasound spectroscopy and/or DFT calculations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Experimentally determined diffuse scattering and calculated TDS of SrSO4 220 reflection with q ∈ [0.06, 0.15] at T = 90 K (top panels), and with the multi-temperature method at T = 90, 130 K (bottom panels). Each image shows a cross section of the reciprocal space in the neighborhood of the selected Bragg peak. The data are grouped by pairs, with the experimental and calculated intensity distributions on the left-hand and right-hand side, respectively. The scattering intensity is shown on a linear color scale from black (zero) to white (maximal intensity).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Comparison of SrSO4 elastic constants as obtained from DFT, ultrasound measurements, TDS single temperature method and TDS multi-temperature (MT) method. The experimental bulk modulus from high-pressure diffraction measurements is also reported.</p><p>Importantly, the analysis is model-free and provides values with a precision comparable to standard methods like ultrasound measurements by Brillouin scattering. The advantage over these methods is that the new approach can be applied to very small and opaque crystals of arbitrary shape and symmetry. The new method allows to measure the elastic properties together with the crystal structure under the same experimental conditions. It implies a broad applicability in material science, geophysics and in the study of sound wave anomalies due to fundamental interactions in condensed matter physics. The proposed methodology can be extended to measurements at extreme conditions such as high pressures, high or low temperatures or high magnetic fields. The application to high pressures is particularly interesting for the establishment of an absolute pressure scale in a single experiment. Temperature dependent studies are also possible. At very low temperatures the strategy is expected to work well and potentially very useful in the study of spin-lattice coupling. At temperatures relevant for geophysical processes absolute values can be obtained if the adiabatic bulk modulus is known.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Structure and lattice dynamics of Pb2SnO4.</head><p>The structure and lattice dynamics of synthetic single crystals of lead stannate were investigated by single crystal diffraction and thermal diffuse scattering. These studies follow our observation of a peak in DSC measurements, indicative of a weak first order transition at T = 340 K (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). We have recorded diffraction data at temperatures between 200 K and 500 K across this transition and refined the structure in order to understand the structural changes associated with this phase transition. The refined structure at T = 500 K is shown in Fig 2 .A and B in ab and bc planes, and is isostructural to the ambient temperature structure. It consists of SnO6 octahedrons and PbO4 tetrahedrons arranged along the long c axis. PbO4 tetrahedrons are highly distorted due to the presence of a stereochemically active lone electron pair on the Pb ion. We observed a small kink in the temperature dependence of the unit cell volume across the transition, thereby confirming the weak-first order character of the transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2D</ref>). No significant variations of the bond lengths were observed across the transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2E</ref>). However, we observed a kink in the temperature dependence of the anisotropic displacement parameter U11 of PbO1, PbO2 and Sn atoms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2F</ref>) while the ADPs of the oxygen atoms seem unaffected by the transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2G</ref>).</p><p>We also investigated the diffuse scattering of lead stannate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). The reconstructions of reciprocal space sections in hk0, h0l and 0kl planes are presented and compared to calculations. A remarkable agreement is observed, indicating that the diffuse features are due to the inelastic scattering from the phonons. The good agreement can be also appreciated with 3D reconstructions of the experimental and calculated TDS intensities. In particular, hk0 and hk2 planes show the most rich thermal diffuse scattering signatures. Selected features will be further investigated by momentum resolved IXS. The diffuse patterns observed in hk0 and hk2 planes originate from a soft transverse acoustic branch, which is related to the instability of the corner-sharing SnO6 and edge-sharing PbO4 chains against shear stress. We observed no change in the TDS across the transition at 340 K.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Soft-phonon driven phase transition in BaVS3</head><p>At ambient conditions BaVS3 crystalizes in a hexagonal structure with space group P63/mmc and lattice parameters a = 6.719 Å, and c = 5.619 Å. Its structure consists of chains of V-S face sharing octahedra running in the c-direction and separated by Ba. At TS = 240 K, the crystal symmetry is lowered from hexagonal to orthorhombic through a displacive second order phase transition associated with a zigzag deformation of the V-S chains. The transition has been long thought to be driven by the softening of a phonon, but the soft mode could never be observed experimentally. Here we used combined diffuse scattering, inelastic X-ray scattering and ab initio calculations to experimentally and theoretically confirm the soft mode character of the symmetry lowering at TS. 3D reconstruction of the diffuse signal around 301 reflection far above (T = 330 K), just above (T = 260 K) and below TS (T = 200 K) are gathered in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> A, B and C respectively. Upon approaching the transition, a strong diffuse signal appears centered at the Γ point and disappears below the transition, indicating the softening of a zone-center phonon. The lattice dynamics with temperature was further investigated by IXS around q = (3.1,0,1). The dispersion of the soft mode was measured above TS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4D</ref>), and its softening is evidenced by the large variation of the central peak upon approaching the transition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4E</ref>). Combined TDS and IXS experiments allowed to identify the soft mode as a low energy optical mode, while Raman experiments did not allow its observation. Analysis of the DFT calculations is ongoing to identify the soft mode. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Lattice dynamics of CaCO3 and MgCO3</head><p>Calcium and magnesium carbonates are the most abundant carbonates on Earth. They are present in oceanic sediments, from where they can be transported to the Earth interior on subducting slabs.</p><p>Understanding the physical properties of these carbonates is a key to understand and detect the processes responsible for transportation of carbon into the deep Earth. The lattice dynamics of these compounds govern the thermodynamic and transport properties, from which geoscientifically important parameters can be derived, such as sound velocities, bulk moduli, thermal expansion and thermal conductivity. We performed x-ray scattering experiments at ID28 at the ESRF. The side station diffractometer was used to obtain diffuse scattering maps of CaCO3 and MgCO3 at ambient conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). As has been observed by Dove et al. before, there is strong diffuse scattering in CaCO3 at the F point of the Brillouin zone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>). We did not observe such features for MgCO3. Further measurements were conducted with the inelastic x-ray scattering spectrometer. We measured the phonon dispersion relations of CaCO3 and MgCO3 in the Γ-F direction. We have observed strong softening of the quasi-transverse acoustic phonon in the case of CaCO3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>), responsible for the high intensity signal in the diffuse scattering maps. We didn't observe any softening at the F point in the case of MgCO3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6B</ref>).</p><p>The observed difference in the lattice dynamics may lead to an explanation of the difference in the stabilities of CaCO3 and MgCO3. The IXS and diffuse scattering data and their interpretation will be presented during the 26 th DGK meeting, a corresponding article is in preparation.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">High temperature measurements in the diamond sample chamber</head><p>The aim of the experiment was to investigate the lattice dynamics of carbonates at elevated temperatures, above their decomposition temperature. In order to prevent the decomposition of the sample at high temperatures it needs to be kept in a CO2 atmosphere at elevated pressure. A novel high temperature cell suitable for such experiments is depicted in Fig 7 . As carbon dioxide is highly reactive at high temperatures, the sample chamber consists of two opposing diamonds, as this is one of the few materials that does not react with CO2 at such conditions. The diamond assembly is heated via a resistive heating system, and pressed uniaxially in order to confine the CO2 inside the diamond chamber. The diamond assembly is kept in vacuum in order to avoid an oxidization of diamond at high temperatures.</p><p>We have first commissioned and tested the new diamond sample chamber offline, and proceeded with the measurement at ID28 during the LTP beamtime. The sample used was a single crystal of calcite, CaCO3, cut and polished in a plate shape, so that the momentum transfer vectors in the (H0L) plane were accessible for the measurement. The crystal was glued to the bottom of the chamber with MgO cement. The diamond chamber was sealed by putting graphite rings in the conical part of the upper diamond. A few grains of MgCO3 powder, which has a lower decomposition temperature than CaCO3, were put aside the crystal to produce CO2 inside the chamber.</p><p>We have performed three experimental runs with the assembly. In the first one the amount of MgCO3 powder was too large. The CO2 pressure was much higher than the uniaxial stress exerted by the sample environment equipment, so that a leak in the diamond chamber was observed along with the loss of pressure and sample decomposition. In the second run we observed the leak of oil in the hydraulic system used to pressurize the diamond assembly, which again resulted in loss of pressure in the sample chamber. After fixing the oil leak we performed the third run, and again observed the sample decomposition. The cause was interpreted to be a CO2 leak through the graphite sealing rings. After minor modifications further experiments at ID28 with improved equipment are planned for the first semester of 2018. We plan to seal the diamond chamber with additional outer gold rings, which plasticity should prevent any leak in the chamber.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Lattice dynamics of low temperature WO3 phases</head><p>We have studied the lattice dynamics of tungsten trioxide as a function of temperature (160 K &lt; T &lt; 350 K) by high resolution inelastic x-ray scattering, IXS, and diffuse scattering, DS. The crystal structure of WO3 can be described as a distorted ReO3 structure, where the WO6-octahedra are cornerconnected. At 300 K WO3 is monoclinic, at 290 K it transforms to a triclinic structure and at 230 K to another monoclinic structure. The distortion of WO6-octahedra increases with decreasing temperature. <ref type="bibr">Kawaminami and Hirose (1979)</ref> suggested that the phase transitions are due to a condensation of phonons at the Γ, M and R points of the cubic aristotype.</p><p>We have measured diffuse scattering maps at the side station of ID28 at ESRF. At 350 K and 250 K we have observed strong diffuse scattering around the (4 0 0) Bragg reflection in the form of diffuse planes, with the normal being the (1 0 0) vector in reciprocal space. This is consistent with our predictions based on DFT calculations. However, at 165 K, where WO3 is in the low temperature monoclinic phase, the diffuse planes are less pronounced compared to the higher temperature phases, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref>. DS measurements helped us to choose the most promising regions for an IXS study on ID28. We have measured the acoustic phonon spectra at 400 K, 290 K, 270 K and at 160 K along the main crystallographic directions.</p><p>The data analysis is currently ongoing, the focus is to compare the results of the calculations with the DS and IXS measurements and identify the soft phonons. Partial results of this study were presented on the IXS-2017 conference in Hamburg, Germany. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Structure of lead stannate in ab (A) and bc (B) planes.
