<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the proposal referred to, was the study of the nucleation and formation of ultra-small AlOOH nanoparticles with the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) Technique. In particular, the focus was set on ligand interactions to the nanoparticle surface and the very early steps of agglomeration and nanoparticle growth.</p><p>In order to resolve the signal and its time dependent change we had to measure close to the limit of the detector time resolution by at the same time acquiring an adequate data quality.</p><p>In preparation to the beamtime we advanced our flowcell setup towards a small reaction reactor in which reactants were mixed in a controlled fashion and the start of the reaction can be monitored with much higher time accuracy. A homogeneous solution was established in the reaction chamber within less than one second for which external conditions such as temperature as well as the ligand addition rate are tuneable.</p><p>The first test of the new reaction vessel was successful as high Qs without the observation of any setup shadowing (e.g. from the stirring magnet or the flight tube extension). The Perkin Elmer detector enabled us to measure at a maximum of 2 s/scan (6 sec in total) in order to collect satisfactory statistics. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> depicts a data set series in which the signal of the amorphous AlOOH precursor structure is isolated and background subtracted.</p><p>In the background corrected data sets after 30 minutes of exposure the first broad Bragg peaks which are characteristic for boehmite appear at a Q of 9, 27, 33 and 44 nm -1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>), respectively. The corresponding PDFs of the clusters which yield data up to about 9 Å confirm the crystalline size and the time dependent development. For fully aged boehmite particles, which are expected to reach sizes of around 3.2 x 2.2 x 1 nm, clear signals are measured up to 30 Å. In a first comparison to those data sets which yield more developed and crystalline AlOOH nanoparticles (which are omitted in this report), the present PDF peak positions are rather similar but the peaks shape is a lot broader. It appears that many sites of the Al(OH) 6 reactants have not yet condensed which explains the lack of a clear boehmite Al-Al distance of 2.9A. Instead we can still observe a very broad maximum at 2.6-3.4 Å indicating that a single condensation process is too fast to be monitored, the orientation and ordering processes of cluster, however, can be resolved by these kinds of measurements. This measurement was carried out at low temperature to investigate a slow transformation of precursor to more crystalline nanoparticles. These reduced data sets represent the early stages of pure boehmite growth and is used as a reference to syntheses to which an organic ligand was added.</p><p>After having set up molecular models, fits to the PDF data will be carried out to facilitate statements on the structural features of the AlOOH precursor (e.g. either chainlike connected polynuclear clusters or 2D flat sheets of AlOOH).</p><p>Similar looking data sets were obtained by adding organic ligands (e.g. methyl sulfonic acid or DMLT) as surface coordinating and stabilizing agents prior to the reaction to the solution. Data thereof also indicate the occurrence of characteristic boehmite peaks, but very late in the synthesis. Moreover, 3 hours at higher temperature are required for peaks to appear. Fig. 2: In-situ synthesis of AlOOH nanoparticels with ligands after background substaction. There are obvious effects of a) carboxylic acid functionalised ligands which features a rather long period of amorphous precursor until the characteristic boehmite pattern slowly evolves b) hydroxyl group functionalised ligands which prevent any visible boehmite peak formation. a) b) a) b) Reaction start </p><p>Therefore, an equilibrium of a ligand Al 3+ complex formed by usual water exchange reactions to a condensed oxo-Al 3+ species might prevail in solution. Until accurate background (which changes over time) corrections and a suitable precursor species is found, assumptions like that should be postponed. In the course of the investigation, however, it would be of great interest whether both, ligand addition at the beginning of the synthesis as co-reactant and ligand addition in later stages of the synthesis have similar effects on the reaction rate and product formation.</p><p>The investigation of a high temperature synthesis and therefore a drastic speedup of the reaction rate and appearing species is very challenging with the Perkin Elmer detector (4-5 sec detector readout time, double as much than the scan time itself). By the collected data however, we should manage to model at least one predominant precursor structure which is stable in solution at room temperature for a few minutes. We appreciate, that the new generation of area detectors (Cd-Te) has arrived at the ESRF which in the future will ease the acquisition of time resolved in-situ data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>and Structural Physics Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</figDesc></figure>
