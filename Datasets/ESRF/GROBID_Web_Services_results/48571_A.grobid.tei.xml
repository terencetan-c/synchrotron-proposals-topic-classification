<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Colloid-size scorodite is an As natural attenuation form in a range of environments. It minimizes As release when dumped on site. However, long-term stability of this mineral is uncertain and their potential transport makes As attenuation capacity of scorodite unclear. Our project aims to study the role of soil colloids as nanovectors of As in the soil-water system and to evaluate the nanosize scorodite stability to assess its potential transport capacity under natural conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental site, sample collection, and analyses</head><p>Mining As-rich wastes from an abandoned smelting factory remain on the soil subjected to erosion and weathering processes in a sub-catchment of the Guadalix River (Madrid, Spain) feeding the Madrid Tertiary Detrital Aquifer. Undisturbed soil cores were taken from the As-bearing waste pile (WP) [A], along the riverbed (RB) of a stream (~1 m wide) that collects runoff from the WP [B and C], from sediments downstream accumulated in an artificial pond (SP) <ref type="bibr">[D]</ref> and from an adjacent farm that receives runoff that overflows the pond during rain events [E] (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). All columns were cut at 15-cm intervals, air-dried, homogenized, and sieved (2-mm mesh) prior to analysis. SEM-EDX was used to collect images and spot semi-quantitative elemental analyses. Mineralogical composition of the ≤2 mm fraction of samples was identified by XRD. Samples from core sections were subjected to a sequential As and Fe extractions <ref type="bibr">(Root et al. 2007)</ref>. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy Arsenic and Fe K-edge spectra were collected from ultrafiltrated colloid-size samples (A 1 , A 4 , B 1 , B 3 , D 1 and E 1 ) at room temperature on BM25A beamline in fluorescence mode using a Si(111) monochromator and a 13-element Si-Li solid-state detector. Beam energy was calibrated for As on KH 2 AsO 4 (s) by setting the maximum absorbance to 11,875 eV and for Fe by setting the first inflection of the absorption edge of metallic Fe foil to 7112 eV. Between 10 and 22 XANES and 12 EXAFS (sample A 1 , spectra for the rest of samples too noisy due to low As mass) spectra were collected and averaged for each sample and element. XANES spectra were analyzed (ATHENA, Ravel and Newville, 2005) by linear least-squares combination fits using a reference compound library (O' <ref type="bibr">Day et al., 2004)</ref> consisting of phyllosilicate and Fe(III) oxide minerals, fit with all combinations of 2 or 3 spectral components, and ranked by statistical best fit. Sensitivity tests of the fit to the number of reference components were performed, treating energy as a variable parameter, and changing the spectral fit range. Sum of the reference components was not forced to 100 %. EXAFS data were analyzed by shell-by-shell method (k-range = 2.0 to 12 Å -1 ) with theoretical reference functions (FEFF 8.0 {Ankudinov, 1998 #216}) based on atomic clusters from crystalline reference compounds <ref type="bibr">(ATOMS {Ravel, 2001 #217})</ref>. A triangular multiple scattering path among bonded As and O atoms, resulting from the high symmetry of arsenate tetrahedral, was included in the fit model in addition to single-scattering paths {Root, 2009 #56}. Interatomic distance (R), and either N (number of backscattering atoms) or σ 2 (Debye-waller factor), was treated as a variable parameter for each atomic shell. Threshold energy (E 0 ) was treated as a single variable for all shells and scale factor (S 0 2 ) was fixed (= 1). Estimated errors based on empirical fits to reference compounds are: first shell: R ± 0.01 Å; σ 2 ± 10% (N fixed); greater than first shell: R ± 0.02 Å; N ± 25% (σ 2 fixed).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Mining wastes, rich in scorodite and dumped on the soil surface from an abandoned smelting factory have been characterized as a point source of As and metals pollution in the surrounding media. Erosion and weathering processes results in a continuous release of As to soils. Microscopic and spectroscopic analysis show that As is present mainly as As(V) and associated with Fe phases along the transect from an As-rich waste pile downward to a shallow soil in both adsorbed and co-precipitated species. No role of scorodite as As nanovector could be detected and only arsenic sulfide minerals were detected in the shallow soil due to seasonal reducing conditions at the sampling time. While both scorodite and Fe(III) oxyhydroxides minerals where As is adsorbed present in the waste hamper As vertical leaching through the waste pile, the effect of natural rainfall and the resulting runoff downhill boost seasonal lateral spreading of As either as dissolved anions or bound to suspended particles within the runoff. Neither the low solubility of scorodite nor other natural As attenuation phenomena such as As(V) sorption onto ferrihydrate should be considered as a desired secondary phases for remediation of As-rich mine waste materials as they do not limit natural spreading of As and companions metals when they are exposed to natural conditions. Both chemical extractions and XAS (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> and table 1) analyses highlight the important role of ferrihydrite as As scavenger in natural systems and confirms the strong association of As(V) with Fe(III) oxide phases. In this dynamic and seasonally variable system, however, other trapping systems such as jarosite-like minerals play a role in the attenuation of As and companion metals released to the medium. However, either due to partial dissolution of these phases or due to the excess of As released, an important amount of As reaches land soils in which temporal hydromorphic and reducing conditions induces the formation of arsenic sulfides phases. Overall, our results highlight the importance of runoff as driving force for As dispersion in the environment. On the basis of our results, it becomes urgent to remediate this mine site as otherwise continuous spreading of As through surface runoff may produce groundwater pollution in Madrid province.
