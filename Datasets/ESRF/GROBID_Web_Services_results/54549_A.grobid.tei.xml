<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We performed high energy reflectivity experiment at the silicon/ electroilyte interface. The electrolyte was the standard EC/DEC/LiPF6 electrolyte, the positive electrode was Lithium Metal and the negative electrode was monocrystalline silicon, heavily doped so as to be conductive. The contact was made through stainless steel electrode on which Lithium and Silicon were contacted. Separation of the two electrodes was made by a PEEK cell body, cylindrical in which the window for X-rays was directly machined.</p><p>We ramped the potential from the 3V open circuit voltage down to 0 V and back using a voltameter cycler, at a rate of 0.1mV/s. Flowing current was measured throughout the experiment. Reflectivity curves were taken in loop, including periodic re-alignment scans (angle and height) and grazing-incidence diffraction scans. Typically 400 reflectivity scans were taken throughout the cycle loop.</p><p>The energy was chosen to 27keV ensuring a good transparency of the 15mm diameter cell. Beam size was typically 50Âµm high.</p><p>A series of reflectivity curves is shown below as a function of decreasing potential voltage. Fig.2 Voltamogram obtained during the experiment showing the occurrence of electrochemeical at different potentials. These evolutions can be matched with reflectivity change, both being associated to interface layer buildup or interface change.</p><p>The reflectivity curves can be fitted to models using the standard algorithms. For the sake of simplicity we used kinematical approximations to fit the data, the full dynamical treatment being unecessary for q&gt;&gt;qc data. Note that to extend the range of validity of kinematical treatment, we used refraction corrected values for q (q'=sqrt(q^2-qc^2)). Once a profile is found using kinematical approximation fits, the solution is validated by a full calculation including critical angle using standard optical matrix formalism.</p><p>Electron density profiles can be extracted from the data with a sequence of layer formation that seems to be more complex than expected.</p><p>The first evolution corresponds to the formation of a thick diffuse layer with reduced electron density compared to the electrolyte. The presence of this reduced density layer against the electrode is signed by an increase of I(q=0). A fit to the data gives a thickness in the 7nm range with a density reduced by typically 10% of the Si/electrolyte density difference. This evolution seems to start already at a voltage of 1.66V where a peak in the electrical current occurs.</p><p>In a second stage the density at the interface seems to increase again, with a reduction of the q=0 intensity. The diffuse character of the layer seems to be maintained.</p><p>In a third stage a very well defined layer appears at low potential, with a density smaller than the electrolyte or the diffuse layer. Its interfaces and thickness (t=1.8nm) are well defined and below the diffuse layer thickness (estimated to 6 to 7nm with a 3nm transition zone between this layer and the electrolyte). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig1.</head><figDesc>Fig1.
