<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Diaschisis is the set of focal and non-focal changes in the structural inner brain connections and disconnections, involving areas distant from the lesion. We used deeply anaesthetized experimental rats opportunely placed on a rotating stage in order to allow for repeated (8) ~100x100 μm 2 X-ray beamlets depositing each 55.6 Gy (100µm width), coming from 8 different directions cumulating ~ 450 Gy at the target. Each beamlet crossing the path of the others in a small volume of a stereotactically identified brain sensory region to generate an inter-subject stable and repetitive degeneration hotspot analyzed at different time-lags from the experimental session. The aim was to understand whether the variety of experimental and clinical pictures resides in the unavoidable variability of the clinical and experimental models, in an idiopathic variability of the far involved areas. The experimental setup is depicted in the figure below. The lesional target has been identified in the hindlimb projection of the primary somatosensory cortex of experimental rats. The experiment gave us the unique opportunity to set up the experimental framework able to collimate several microbeams in a common focus through different projection on a sole axis. Most of beamtime shifts has been spent for this purpose. In addition, we preliminary found a clear cellular degeneration within the radiation focus but further analyses on the sliced brain sampled should be done accompanied by another set of experiments at the beamline to investigate the phenomenon in experimental models of chronic pain.</p></div>			</div>
