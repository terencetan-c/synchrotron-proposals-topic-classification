<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>-Introduction This experiment is a first step of a wider project concerning Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) process, which has a very dangerous effect on the environment. During AMD, various disordered ferric hydroxides and oxyhydroxides are formed, leading to the potential release of heavy metals in the environment. This very first part of the project aims to the structural characterization of the disorder in natural and synthetic goethite (which is the simplest of these materials), as they are, and doped with Pb. Rietveld method and Pair Distribution Function will be applied in order to characterized these materials on the average and local structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-Materials</head><p>Different samples were prepared starting from a synthetic commercially available goethite (Sigma-Aldrich), which was used as reference sample. Pure goethite was doped with different lead amounts by absorption of cations from a solution of lead nitrate with different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 50 mM). Goethite was left in contact with the Pb-containing solution for 24h, and then filtered. Two sample-sets were prepared taking into account two rinsing treatments: i) samples rinsed once in water ii) samples rinsed twice in water. The solid residual was then heated at 200°C in order to facilitate the incorporation of lead into the structure. In addiction also two natural samples were investigated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p>Pb concentration Treatment Goethite Reference Goethite1 1, 5, 10, 50 mM Single rinsing Goethite2 1, 5, 10, 50 mM Double rinsing Natural Goethite 1 Natural Goethite 2</p><p>Table 1: investigated samples</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-Data collection</head><p>Total scattering data was collected by multyanalizar detector using a short wavelenght (0.354379 Å) in order to achive high resolution on the reciprocal and direct space. Each data collection lasted 3 hour to obtain high counting statistics at high Q, indispensable to obtain then suitable Pair Distribution Functions. Some selected samples were collected also at 80 K for a better signal, with less thermal diffused scattering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-Results</head><p>Samples synthetically prepared were compared between them and with the reference sample. As demonstrated by figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, samples doped with different amount of lead and treated with different leacing treatment (Goethite 1 and 2) show differences in peak position. This demonstrates a different amount of incorporated lead. In table 2 and 3 cell parameters of two samples treated by different rinsing treatment are reported comparing also values of the reference sample. Doped samples present smaller volume values due to the incorporation of Pb. The same can be seen, for the same sample set (goethite1 or goethite2) as a function of starting lead content.</p><p>Sample Cell Volume (Å 3 ) Goethite Reference 138.72(2) Goethite 1_50 138.60(2) Goethite 2_50 138.61(2) Table 2: cell volumes for some samples treated with different rinsing treatment Table 3: cell parameters for some samples treated with different rinsing treatment Sample a (Å) b (Å) c (Å) Goethite Reference 4.60586(7) 9.96281(5) 3.02306(2) Goethite 1_50 4.60434(7) 9.96274(4) 3.02160(4) Goethite 2_50 4.60446(8) 9.96416(1) 3.02121(4)</p><p>Furthermore, by looking figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, the different rinsing treatments for sure influence the adsorbed lead released. Indeed, despite similar cell parameters, samples rinsed just once (goethite1), presents broader peaks. This could be related to a possible local disorder. As demonstrated in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, doped samples present some differences at the local scale in comparison to the reference sample, in particular some PDF peaks, especially those related to Fe-Fe distances, tend to have the same position as those of the reference sample, while other (Fe-Fe as well as Fe-O distances) have a different position and a different shape, with respect to each other and to the reference sample. Moreover the two rinsing treatments seem to originate structural differences also at the medium scale (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, right hand side). Deeper studies will be performed in order to describe and charachterized these differences. Unfortunately, the experiment was performed from the 16 th to the 20 th of February, so the results presented here are only very preliminary.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: comparison of diffraction patterns between samples prepared with Pb and the reference.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.00,241.53,351.35,124.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
