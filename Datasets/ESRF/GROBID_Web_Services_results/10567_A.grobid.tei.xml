<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>L&amp;MO2 compounds are among the best candidates for new rechargeable batteries. A surprinsingly high delocalisation in r-space in the region [0, 1 u.a.] is evidenced on the figure for valence electrons of Lio,9sNi1,0202 compared to Li0.63Ni1,0202 The reverse tendency is seen for larger pz : the negative part is an evidence of a large electronic density distorsion.</p><p>We will be able to compare our experimental results with theoretical results calculated by Sohrab Rabii (University of Pennsylvania, USA) using an ab initio pseudopotential method.</p><p>Wave functions have already been computed for the stoechiometric compounds (LiNiOT and LiCoOz) by <ref type="bibr">MKAydinol et al. (Phys.Rev. B56,1354</ref><ref type="bibr">(1997)</ref>) and will be provided to S.Rabii for Compton profile calculations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>The aim of the experiment is to describe the changes in the d-states of Ni and the role played by the nature of the transition metal in Li,M02. Experiment on Li,MOz has been performed using the scanning mode spectrometer of beamline ID 15B. The synchrotron radiation was monochromatized at 55.8 keV and the scattering angle fixed at 160". Two samples with different values of x (x = 1.05 and 0.63) in Li,NiOz, corresponding to different steps in the electrochemical cycling process, were measured, together with LiCoOz. The data sets have been corrected for energy dependent effects such as photoelectric absorption in sample, analyser and air as well as for multiple processes. Valence Compton profiles were extracted from the total measured Compton profiles by substracting a QSCF core profile (in collaboration with A.Issolah, Algeria).The difference between two valence Compton profiles measured for two lithium i concentrations allows us to determine the importance of distorsion in the electronic density i due to the de-intercalation of lithium. Moreover, such a procedure cancels out most of 1 systematical errors.The figure below shows the difference between Lio.gsNir .02O2 (stoechiometric LiNi02 not being synthetisable) and Li0.63Ni1.0202 valence profiles.</figDesc></figure>
