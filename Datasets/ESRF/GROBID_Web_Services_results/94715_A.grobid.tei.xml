<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim of the project</head><p>Improving the efficiency and enhancing the colour uniformity of the LED-based products is one of the main goals of the lighting industry. Given that a significant share of worldwide energy consumption belongs to the lighting sector, any improvement in the performance and efficiency of LEDs will have a major positive implication for the society and the environment. This project aimed at synthesizing SiO2-YAG:Ce 3+ phosphor core-shell structures in order to increase the mie-scattering of the light and to increase the efficiency of LEDs. This will also result in products of higher reliability and lifetime. When it comes to the mie-scattering, the surface structure of particles (in this case SiO2) and the uniformity of the shell thickness play a vital and prominent role. Not much is known about the kinetics and growth mechanism of the shell layer on SiO2 particles, and how this can be controlled and manipulated during synthesis. Direct microscopic methods are not suitable for this purpose, due to the fact that the shell is only a few nanometres. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique is the most suitable method for studying the structure and the thickness of the YAG:Ce3 + phosphor layer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Materials and methods YAG:Ce synthesis YAG:Ce phosphor was synthesized by a novel simple method, wherein the mixture of three raw materials (Y2O3, Al2O3 and CeO2) were first acidified by diluted nitric acid to prepare a precursor, followed by a high temperature heating treatment of the obtained precursor under reductive atmosphere.</p><p>Synthesis of SiO2@YAG:Ce core-shell phosphors SiO2 core spheres with YAG:Ce shell were prepared by a sole gel process. The starting materials were mixed in stoichiometric proportion. Materials were dissolved in dilute nitric acid solution. The prepared precursors were mixed with different ratios of water/ethanol solution containing citric acid as the chelating agent of the metal ions. The molar ratio of metal ions to citric acid was 1:2. Then, polyethylene glycol was added rapidly into the solution beaker with a concentration of 0.10 g/ml. The pH of the solution was adjusted ~6 and the solution was stirred for ~3 h to form sols. Then the silica particles were added under vigorous stirring. After being mixed for about 5 h, the suspension was separated by centrifugation. The particles were dried at 100˚C and annealed at the desired temperatures, for 2 h, with a heating rate of 4˚C/min. The above process was repeated several times to increase the thickness of the nano-layers on silica spheres. Due to a smooth and adherent formation of YAG:Ce 3+ nano layers, coated on the silica spheres, the luminescence properties are comparable to that of the pure YAG:Ce3+ phosphors. Besides, SiO2 particles act as scattering agents in LED lens. Synthesized particles will then have dual functionalities, with superior photoluminescence properties and better colour temperature. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows schematics of a core-shell particle.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Core shell structure SAXS Measurements SAXS technique was carried out at ESRF to study the structural properties of particles, synthesized under various reaction conditions. This information can hardly be obtained with direct observation methods, including SEM and TEM. Data need to yet analysed, but we expect that SAXS provides information about aggregation, the thickness of shell, shell structure, particle size, and morphology. SAXS information can be obtained by plotting I(q) versus q function. The scattering curve, I(q), comes from the subtraction of the buffer from the sample, in which I(q) is a function of the momentum transfer and q is given as bellow: q=(2π sinθ)/λ (Å-1, nm-1) Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows SAXS set-up at ESRF in which detectors, and sample holders are clearly seen. Almost two shifts were spent to set and optimize measurement parameters. The whole overnight was then devoted to do measurements on samples. WAXS data was also collected, since we realized that samples show good crystallinity (see diffraction rings of sample in position 3, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Both SAXS and WAXS data were collected simultaneously, with same collection strategy that was collecting 8 images of 25 seconds each on all of the samples on the grid. Incoming wavelength of the x-ray beam was: ƛ= 1.040A. Data were azimuthally integrated in q space (unit nm-1), and subtracted the empty Kapton foil data as background.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses of synthesized phosphor powders</head><p>The XRD patterns of as-prepared phosphor powders, synthesized at different pH values and calcined at 1000 °C for 4 h, are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>. It appeared the outcome of the synthesis was largely dependent on the pH values. The optimum synthesis condition is achieved when the pH is strictly controlled at a value of 3. Any deviation from pH=3 towards higher values, and more specifically towards ~3.5-4.0 pH range results in the appearance of YAM (Y4Al2O9) and YAP (YAlO3) transitional phases in as-synthesized powders. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> shows clear difference between XRD patterns of phosphor powders, synthesized at pH=3 and that synthesized at pH range 3.5-4. Boukerika et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> reported that pure cubic YAG phase with optimum optical properties can be attained at pH≤4. It is reported that in case of pH≥6, the formation of unfavorable phases such as Y4Al2O9 (YAM) and YAlO3 (YAP) is inevitable. The finding in this study is rather different with what is reported by Boukerika et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, as the pure YAG was found out to be obtainable at pH≤3. This has possibly to do with the fact that different raw materials are used in these studies. Both YAM and YAP phases are considered as impurities in YAG, as they cause energy level splitting of luminescence centers. This obviously adversely affects optical properties of phosphor. Overall, pH value appears to be the most crucial controlling factor when it comes to the final phase composition of synthesized powders. Obtaining a pure homogenous phosphor phase is only possible when pH is strictly controlled. As mentioned earlier, the pH in this case was kept at 3 by dropwise addition of NH3 solution. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref> also shows FESEM image of synthesized YAG:Ce powders. It is clear that nanoparticles with spherical morphology are perfectly homogenously dispersed. Elemental mapping of a synthesized YAG:Ce particle, depicted in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>, shows that elements are also perfectly homogeneously distributed.  Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref> shows an example of the XRD pattern of samples annealed at 1000 °C. All peaks in the XRD patterns perfectly match with those of cubic YAG (JCPDS Card No. 79-1891) and no other crystalline phase such as YAlO3 (YAP) or Y4Al12O9 (YAM) can be detected. Also, to make sure that synthesized YAG has a structure, similar to that of industrial YAG, XRD spectra of synthesized and commercial YAG samples were compared (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>). As mentioned earlier, single-phase pure YAG is very important to achieve high luminescence efficiency. Existing dopants obviously do not alter the structure of crystalline YAG. However, they surely change lattice parameters owing to the inequality of ionic radii between substituted yttrium ion and the dopant.</p><p>A detailed XRD study on the effect of annealing time on the formation of YAG phase in core shell nanoparticles was carried out. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref> shows XRD patterns of SiO2@YAG:Ce nanoparticles after annealing from 1 to 10 h. The YAG phase starts to form after 1 h of annealing at 1000 °C. Therefore, one can conclude that crystallization time can be efficaciously decreased through the sol-gel method, so in this work the minimum crystallization time is found to be 1 h at 1000 °C. Appearance of sharp peaks and increasing the intensity of the main peak (2θ=33.4 is the point that cubic YAG:Ce structure main peak exist and related to the plane of crystalline with Miller indices of {4 2 0}) is an indication of crystallization during annealing. With the increase in calcination time, the intensity of diffraction peaks of SiO2@YAG:Ce sample slightly increases, inferring that the degree of crystallinity has increased. Meanwhile, this also indicates that mean crystallite size increases with increase in annealing temperature. The same is expected when annealing temperature is increased. a) b) octahedra (AlO6), tetrahedra (AlO4), and dodecahedra (YO8) with corner-shared O atoms. The co-doped Ce 3+ ion as luminescence centers substitutes for Y 3+ ion that is located in the position of YAG dodecahedral. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAXS analyses</head><p>Obtained SAXS data are presented in a log-log plot. SAXS curves are essentially plots of intensity as a function of the scattering vector q, which corresponds to the scattering angle 2θ, given by [34]: q = × sinθ (1), The measured SAXS data were modeled using a commonly named global unified fit model <ref type="bibr">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr">36]</ref>. In fact, this model includes a power-law regime in order to describe the mass or surface fractal and a Guinier regime for characterizing the mean structural size, given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐼(𝑞) = ∑ 𝐺 exp (-𝑞 𝑅 /3) + 𝐵 exp (-𝑞 𝑅 ( ) /3) × √ (2),</formula><p>where, Rgi is the radius of gyration, erf is written for the error function, i refers to the differently sized structures, Gi the Guinier pre-factor, and Bi is the pre-factor specific to the power-law scattering with an exponent Pi. The mean primary particle size dp (for spherical particles) can be estimated from the radius of gyration Rg, which can be obtained by Guinier's law <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">𝑑 = 2 × 𝑅 (3),</formula><p>a) c) A A Y Oo SiO2 @ 1 Hour 2.5 Hour 5 Hour 10 Hour b) d)</p><p>In case nanoparticles have a log-normal size distribution, in order to characterize the particle size distribution from the SAXS data, three fit parameters, Rg, G and B are often used. The geometric standard deviation (σg) in this case is given by [3]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">𝜎 = exp ln × .</formula><p>(4), which characterizes the width of the size distribution. In the scattering vector q region, the scattering intensity I(q) can be characterized by the so-called power law <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>: 𝐼(𝑞) = 𝐵 × 𝑞 (5), where B is the power-law pre-factor and P refers to the power-law exponent. From log I(q) versus log q curves and slopes of linear region (at large values of scattering vector q), the values of the exponent P can be measured. In order to study particle surface characteristics like roughness, the surface-fractal dimension or ds (ds=6-P) is often used <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This is particularly useful for ideal two-phase structure with smooth surfaces and sharp boundaries. In order to determine the effective thickness of boundary structure along the radial direction of the sphere (and more specifically for the spherical domain with a linear or sigmoidal electron-density interface gradient), the following formula can be used [3]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">𝐸 = 2√3𝜎<label>(6)</label></formula><p>, where σ is written for the standard deviation of the Gaussian smoothing function and E refers to the thickness of the diffuse boundary interface, which can be measured by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>: 𝐼(𝑞) ≈ 𝐾 × 𝑞 × (1 -𝑞 𝐸 /12) (7) Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref> shows the scattering curves I(q) measured for pure SiO2 and SiO2@YAG:Ce nanoparticles. Before the coating was applied, the measured SAXS curve of un-coated SiO2 did not exhibit any specific side maxima. In order to extract structural information from the spectra, the data of the pure SiO2 were fitted by Guinier law (Eq. 2), the measured radius of gyration for primary particle of SiO2 (RG,P) is 8.9 nm (dp= 22.97 nm, σg=1.34) which is in accordance with the presented TEM image. The power-law fit in the high of scattering vector q region follows Porod's law, i.e. I∼q -3.67 , that implies these silica nanoparticles have almost smooth surfaces (surface fractals or Ds = 2.33). After preparation of core-shell nanoparticles, a specific side maximum or a shoulder appears (red mark). On the other hand, the coating process resulted in the formation of a YAG:Ce shell, growing on the SiO2 particle surface gradationally by heterogeneous nucleation. Similar side maximum or shoulders have been reported in the literature as particle-particle interactions (structure factor). SiO2@YAG:Ce with two times coating (coat II), the progressive growth of shell is more visible in the SAXS in which the shoulder or specific side maximum is more clear (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7b</ref>), suggesting that the shell grows with time. So, the YAG:Ce shell becomes thicker and the side maximum or shoulder is shifted to smaller scattering vector q region. In order to calculate the shell thickness, the SAXS data of the pure SiO2@YAG:Ce (coat I and II) were fitted by Eq. 7, as displayed in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>. The calculated mean thicknesses of the diffuse and formed interfacial boundary nanostructured layer of one and two cycle coating are 2.8 nm and 7.7 nm, respectively. The stability of SiO2@YAG:Ce core-shell nanoparticles at 1000 ºC for different time was investigated by heating the sample from 1 to 10 hour in air. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref> shows SAXS measurement of SiO2@YAG:Ce nanoparticles, calcined at 1000 ºC for different times. It is noticeable that SAXS curves for all the specimens is almost similar, inferring that after calcination the core-shell structure of SiO2@YAG:Ce nanoparticles was perfectly preserved. Even heating the sample up to 10 h hardly results in any change in the morphology of nanoparticles, inferring that SiO2 cores are still encaged within the YAG:Ce shells, obviously showing high thermal stability of SiO2@YAG:Ce coreshell nanoparticles. It is noteworthy that the exponent of power-law fit at large q is greater than four (for example, I ∼ q -4.20 ), inferring that there exists a sprayed and formed boundary nanostructure like thin layer formed on the particle surface of SiO2.  </p></div>

The increase in the PL intensity with double coating cycle is obviously attributable to the increase of the shell thickness (YAG:Ce) on the SiO2 cores which in turn increases emitting ions (Ce 3+ ) per core-shell particle.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Small Angle X-ray Spectroscopy (SAXS) set-up at ESRF.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,83.64,156.96,211.56,118.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
