Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows an illustration of the thin walled-friction welded tubes and the area of interest for this study as well as the welded tubes and lastly the set-up on the beam line. Test matrix process parameters: Weld Nr Platform Down force [kN] Spindle speed [rpm] Upset distance [mm] Forge force [kN] Forging time [s] Weld completed Zr-1 Weldcore III 1.5 1500 0.5 2.0 5 Yes Zr-2 Weldcore III 1.5 3000 0.5 2.0 5 Yes Zr-3 Weldcore III 1.5 1500 0.75 2.0 5 Yes Zr-4 Weldcore III 1.5 3000 0.75 2.0 5 Yes Zr-5 Weldcore III 1.5 1000 0.5 2.0 5 Yes Zr-6 Weldcore III 1.0 1500 0.5 2.0 5 Yes Zr-7 Weldcore III 1.5 1500 0.5 2.0 5 Yes Note: sample Zr-1 was used for Dzero measurements.</p><p>The Experiment:</p><p>After setting up the two energy dispersive detectors, we mounted a set of tubes in the beam and acquired the diffraction patterns in radial, hoop and axial position with respect to the tube axis with beam sizes of the order of tens of microns. We scanned at different position in the tubes, and through the wall thickness. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows a typical diffraction patternn of the hexagonal alpha-Zr phase fitted with GSAS after conversion to virtual angledispersive diffraction. This allows us to access more peak profile functions.</p><p>The peaks are clearly separated and easy to fit. We are now processing the strain-maps obtained from the measurements in order to calculate the residual stresses induced by the Friction processing. The further evaluation of all the data obtained has been the subject of a Masters, forming the primary contribution of experimental work. It is also anticipated that the analysed data will be published following the acceptance of the Masters dissertation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Illustration of the set-up (top left) and the actualy welded samples (bottom right) with the set-up on beam line shown at bottom.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,197.18,594.69,200.96,148.25" type="bitmap" /></figure>
