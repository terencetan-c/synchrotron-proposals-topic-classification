<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In this experiment we investigated the chemical and structural environment of cerium incorporated in Hench bioactive glasses by means of Ce K-edge x-ray absorption measurements, in the near edge and extended energy ranges. The experiment was based on previous studies of cerium-doped glasses, which showed that the incorporation of cerium oxide at low concentration in bioactive glasses is effective in reducing H 2 O 2 concentration in solution, showing a good catalase mimetic activity <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The aim of the present experiment was to provide a description of the local atomic environment of Ce in these materials at different Ce concentration, at different compositions and for different soaking times. This information is expected to be useful to understand the functionality of the material and to provide a valuable input for the modelization of the system, in turn extremely important for a rational design and optimization of the material. The bioactive glass samples, with the nominal molar composition of 45S5 Hench glasses, (46.2-x)% SiO 2 24.3% Na 2 O 26.9%CaO 2.6% P 2 O 5 x% CeO 2 , were prepared by conventional melt quenching methods, and subsequently milled and sieved to obtain glass powders with particle size in the 250-500 µm range. Three kinds of samples were investigated, namely a set of three "as quenched" (AQ) Hench glasses containing different amounts (molar concentration of 5.3%, 3.6% and 1.2%) of cerium oxide; two sets of 5.3% doped Hench glasses soaked for different times, up to 7 days, in 1M and 0.1M H 2 O 2 solutions and an AQ 3.6% cerium-doped Kokubo glass, a bioactive glass with molar composition very close to Hench glasses, which does not contain P 2 O 5. In addition, three reference samples, CeO 2 , Ce(NO 3 ) 3 and CePO 4 , were also measured. All of the data were collected at nitrogen temperature, in transmission mode. The overall quality of the data can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>. The XANES spectra in Fig1a show that the local atomic neighbourhood in AQ Hench glasses differs from both CeO 2 and Ce(NO 3 ) 3 , reference samples in which Ce is in the 4+ and 3+ oxidation state, respectively. The preliminary results of a first shell (Ce-O) analysis, carried out in the 2÷7 Å -1 k and 1÷3 Å R range are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref> reports the Fourier transform of the χ(k) of the three AQ Hench glasses. The fit curves (in red) are in good agreement with the data. Fig. <ref type="figure">d</ref> shows the behaviour of the measured Ce-O distance with increasing cerium oxide concentration. A contraction of the Ce-O distance compared to the CeO 2 bulk value is evident, while for the different doping levels the values are the same within the errors. Similar results were obtained on the two series of Hench glasses soaked in H 2 O 2 . Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> show good quality first-shell fits for the 1M (a) and 0.1M (b) series, while Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref> shows the behaviour of the Ce-O distance with soaking time. A contraction of the Ce-O distance with respect to bulk CeO 2 is evident, but also in this case it is not possible to clearly detect modifications of the distance with soaking time. The data analysis is still in progress. The next steps include a fitting of the data collected from Kokubo glass, to tell if the Ce local atomic environment is different in the presence and in the absence of phosphorous in the glass matrix. A second shell fit of the Hench glasses (extending the k and the R range), will be also tried in order to test the possibility of having information on the second coordination shell.</p><p>[1] V.
