<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Following up on work from the previous BAG on Hjc, we have obtained crystals of Hje, a second resolvase from S. solfataricus which has homology to Hjc. The structure is of interest as Hje and Hjc have quite different DNA cutting patterns. Restriction enzymes in general utilise differing arrangements of monomers in a dimer to vary the cutting pattern, but sequence analysis suggests that Hjc and Hje should have a conserved dimer interface. Time on EH2 on the previous day was used to obtain a good quality native dataset prior to the successful MAD/SAD experiment performed on EH4. Hje contains 2 Met residues per monomer (disregarding the initiating Met) and Matthews coefficient and a K=180 self rotation function peak indicate the presence of a dimer in the AU.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Data: A scan across the selenium edge a strong fluoresence signal with a significant white line, indicating that anomalous data should be collected at energies of 12.661 GeV (peak), 12.6583 GeV (inflection) and 13.2 GeV (remote). Indexing of the initial diffraction pattern confirmed P61/5 spacegroup with typical unit cell of <ref type="bibr">92.1, 92.1, 72.3, 90, 90, 120</ref> and MOSFLM/STRATEGY suggested collecting wedges of 60 degrees for 4fold multiplicity of Bijvoet pairs. Scaling and SCALA analysis suggested that a strong anomalous signal was present.</p><p>Analysis: While on the beamline still, we ran SOLVE which produced a consistent set of 4 Se sites quickly and very good phasing statistics (FOM &gt; 0.5) in spacegroup P65. The maps both before and after RESOLVE were, however, uninterpretable. At this point we chose to compare the 4 Se sites with an anomalous patterson calculated using the peak data and decided that they were consistent, so we ran MLPHARE with these sites as SAD phasing using the peak data. The results were excellent. While the MLPHARE FOM was lower than the SOLVE one, at 0.23, DM converged very quickly producing a high quality map which wARP easily interpreted. We have not investigated this further as we are busy analysing the model!</p></div>		</body>
