<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Soft x-ray resonant scattering has been used to examine the charge and magnetic interactions in the helical antiferromagnetic compound DyFe 4 Al 8 . By tuning to the Dy M IV,V absorption edges and Fe L II,III absorption edges we can directly observe the behavior of the Dy 4f and Fe 3d electron shells. Magnetic satellites surrounding the (110) Bragg peak were observed below the ordering temperature of 60 K. Our results demonstrate the incommensurate AFM ordering of the Dy and Fe sublattices as a function of temperature. The (001) Bragg peak was identified, and then the sample was cooled. At base temperature altering the energy on this Bragg peak identified the energy corresponding to the maximum resonance of the M V edge.</p><p>Using incident x-rays of this energy, multiple satellites were found in the [110] direction around the (110) Bragg peak (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Scans in reciprocal space in the [110] direction corresponded to θ,2θ scans. This avoided scanning in the χ direction, which is unreliable in the ID08 chamber. As well as peaks appearing at positions corresponding to those previously observed by neutrons nτ peaks, where n = odd, we also observed peaks with n = even observed by resonant scattering at the Dy L edges. In addition we observed a peak corresponding to the (0,0,5τ) peak from the origin. For all of these peaks τ = 0.133. We performed high resolution energy scans of the (1,1,0) Bragg peak (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), and (1-τ ,1-τ ,0) satellite peak (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) through the Dy M IV,V edges on the ID08 beamline, with δE/E ≈ 50meV at 20 K. These energy scans show a strong resonance at the M V edge and a much weaker resonance at the M IV edge.</p><p>The resonance of the satellite peak at the M V edge was split into two strong peaks at 1293 eV and 1296 eV, with a possible shoulder on the high energy side of the peak at 1296 eV. The Bragg peak showed a similar resonance, but with a weaker resonant enhancement, and a broader resonance. Proportionally the M IV resonance is more intense on the Bragg peak than on either satellite.  It has been suggested a number of times that the iron in these systems orders at ~100 K. To test this we tuned the energy to the Fe L edges. Because of the reduction in the size of the Ewald sphere at this energy, it is only possible to reach the (1-3τ, 1-3τ, 0) superlattice peak at the Fe L edges, all the other peaks apart from the (5τ, 5τ, 0) require 2θ &gt; 180. We did not observe the (0,0,5τ) peak which we attribute to it's very low intensity. We could only observe the (0,0,3τ) magnetic peak at the Fe L II and L III edges. No resonance was observed at the Fe L I edge. The resonance shows a single peak corresponding to the Fe L III edge, and a very weak peak at the Fe L II edge.</p><p>Our results demonstrate the advantages of atomic selective magnetic resonance tecchniques. Soft x-ray resonant diffraction is particularly useful due to the extremetly strong resonant enhancement of both the 3d electrons in Fe and the 4f electrons in Dy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Scattered x-ray intensity as a function of incident photon energy at the constant wavevector of (a) Q = (110) at 20 K, (b) Q = (1-τ, 1-τ, 0) at 20 K, and (c) Q = (1-τ, 1-τ, 0) at 28K, through the Dy M IV and M V edges.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.32,197.78,249.36,160.08" type="bitmap" /></figure>
