<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Using the very high energy resolution ID16 beamline we have determined the excitation spectrum of both amorphous forms of water, i.e. high-density (HDA) and low-density amorphous ice (LDA) and compared it to crystalline ice I c . Details concerning the instrument setup can be found in cond-mat /0002340 (equally submitted to PRL). A selection of inelastic spectra are reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. In both amorphous ice phases and in the cubic crystalline phase there are well pronounced resonances. Increasing Q one initially observes a single feature with a marked dispersion. At Q-values higher than 5 nm -1 the spectra become more complicated by the appearance of additional inelastic features. As Xrays couple directly to the longitudinal component of the density fluctuations, the dispersive excitation can be readily identified with the longitudinal acoustic-like branches. In HDA these excitations can be clearly observed up to about 5 nm -1 while in LDA and I c they can be safely distinguished from the other features up to 10 nm -1 . In both LDA and HDA one observes that the resonances become broader with increasing Qtransfer. A systematic Q-dependence can, however, not be established. Despite the difficulty to give full account of the observed broadening in the measured spectra, one can deduce the following important observation: As seen by the naked eye, the width of the resonances remains by far smaller than the excitation energy for all the considered Q-values. This result is very different from the observation made so far in other glassy systems.</p><p>There, in fact, one observes an acoustic phonon-like resonance with a linear dispersion of Ω(Q) vs. Q and a quadratic dispersion of Γ(Q) vs Q. A further observation coming from the analysis is that the spectra of LDA, at all considered Q-values, are very similar to those measured in ice I c . In HDA the resemblance is less pronounced.This shows that these two states of the water molecule possess a surprisingly crystal-like dynamic response. These experimental findings are in sharp contrast to the results found so far in other glasses, glass forming materials, liquids, dense gases and disordered materials in general. We deduce from our data highly intact hydrogen bond networks both in LDA and to some lesser degree equally in HDA. Due to the constraints of the network the number of states the system can sample on the ps time scale should be small, i.e. there is a small configurational entropy, a view which is compatible with thermodynamic data. HDA is expected to possess a larger configurational entropy, and on this basis one can justify that HDA has more "glassy behavior" than LDA.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Inelastic X-ray spectra of high density amorphous HDA, low density amorphous LDA and crystalline cubic ice I c at the indicated Q values lying mainly in the first pseudo Brillouin zone.
