<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>V 2 O 5 -WO 3 -TiO 2 catalysts are widely used to selectively reduce the NO x in the exhaust gas of various stationary sources but also mobile applications such as e.g. trucks and ships. Conventional XAS cannot be directly applied for studying the V sites in the case of V-W-TiO 2 , since W is highly absorbing around V K edge compromising transmission measurement and Ti fluorescence lines almost overlap with those on V when using standard fluorescence detection techniques. To overcome these challenges we performed a series of HERFD-XANES and V2C XES measurements at the ESRF ID26 beamline.</p><p>The catalyst used in this study consisted of 2wt.% V -9wt.% W on TiO 2 with a surface area of 70 m²/g. The catalyst was pressed, crushed and sieved to obtain a fraction of 0.13 -0.25 mm. The catalyst powder was placed inside a 1 mm quartz capillary serving as a micro reactor. It was mounted on top of a hot air gas blower (Oxford GSB-1300) connected to the gas dosing system. Gases were provided from gas bottles and dosed by mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst). Water vapor (3% H 2 O) was dosed via a saturator. The catalyst was heated from room temperature to 550 °C in He for cleaning purposes and the temperature and gas flow was kept constant for the whole experiment. Twenty different gas compositions have been analysed during the beamtime, alongside a set of model compounds representative of the most common V coordination geometries and oxidation states.</p><p>To study the reaction mechanism for the selective catalytic reduction over vanadium it was necessary to analyse different compositions of gas mixtures to indentify different features in the spectrum evolving from different chemical reactions. By comparing the pre-edge peak centroid position and intensity of model compounds (with pure speciation) with that of the sample under different gas feeds we see a clear change of V speciation as a function of the gas atmosphere.</p><p>The presence of NH 3 or C 3 H 6 without any other reactants reduces the vanadium with respect to the ex situ results from the pellets. Its speciation is comparable to a pure octahedral V 4+ . On the other hand the presence of NO or O 2 without any other reactant partly oxidises V up to an intermediat state between +4 and +5 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Due to the competition of reactants on the active sites of the catalyst some of these changes cancel out each other if more reactants are present. For an example the capability of C 3 H 6 to reduce the catalyst is not detectable if the gases for a standard SCR composition are present.</p><p>We could see a difference in the signal for a standard SCR gas composition if the temperature changes.</p><p>Increasing the temperature form 250 °C to 400 °C leads to a shift of the pre-edge feature to higher energies. Due to the possibility to perform spatially resolved measurement we could also see that there is a difference as well. If there is no water present the oxidation state of the catalyst will raise from inlet to outlet in a standard SCR feed with V having the highest oxidation state at the outlet (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). From this experiment, HERFD-XANES has proved to be one of the few tools which allows to gather insights into the V speciation in a sample of great technological impact which has a critical composition such as V-W-TiO 2 catalysts. We have been able to differentiate the V oxidation state and local geometry under a number of different model and realistic reaction conditions. The combination of our in situ setup, which allows to simulate realistic conditions, and the modern photon inphoton out spectroscopic techniques available at ID26 open a new set of possibilities to study catalytic systems previously experimentally inaccessible.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>and XES studies of V-W-TiO 2 catalysts for NO x removal by selective catalytic reduction</figDesc></figure>
