Data processing was carried at home institute using CryoSPARC software version2.9. The motion corrected movies were imported in the software, CTF estimated and good micrographs were separated from the bad ones by checking individual micrographs. Template based picking was done from few micrographs, followed by particle extraction and 2D classification. Then, these particles were used as template to optimize the autopick and extract particles from all micrographs, and go for 2D classification. Initial processing showed that the data collection at this tilt angle (-30°) was not sufficient to obtain side views and we could observe only few titled views as well as a lot of drift even after motion correction. Furthermore, due to ice thickness of the micrographs we couldn't see much features in the later 2D classes. We could have obtained a better dataset if we were allowed to prepare fresh grids due to emergency conditions, we had the protein with us as well as the expert, but unfortunately, due to the rules and regulations of ESRF, we weren't able to do so.</p><p>Hence, it would be necessary to optimize the tilt angle and collect better movies to obtain sufficient side views to build high resolution structure of kainate receptor. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows a glimpse of processing of movies.</p><p>Figure2: Data processing of motion corrected and CTF estimated movies</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,149.20,37.60,315.30,177.35" type="bitmap" /></figure>
