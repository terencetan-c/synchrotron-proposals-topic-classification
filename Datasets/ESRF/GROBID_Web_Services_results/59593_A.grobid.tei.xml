The aim of this project is to investigate the structural basis of the Frank-Starling law of the heart, which states that the force during the contraction (systole) is adapted to the volume attained by the ventricle at the end of the relaxation (end-diastolic volume). At the level of the sarcomere, the structural unit of heart muscle cell, in which myosin motors work cooperatively generating steady force and shortening by cyclic ATP-driven interactions with the interdigitating actin filaments, the Frank-Starling law consists in the so called length-dependent activation (LDA), that is the increase in the force of contraction with the increase in sarcomere length (SL). Thus to collect and control the SL changes accompanying the mechanical output is a crucial prerequisite of the investigation. In the previous visit (LS-2450) we have combined the fast sarcomere mechanics developed in our lab for intact trabeculae with the unique possibility at beamline ID02 to vary the sample-to-detector distance from 0.6 to 30 m, so that the nanometer-scale signals originating from the two arrays of myosin motors in each thick filament can be recorded together with the micrometer-scale changes in the length of the sarcomeres interrogated by the X-ray beam. In this way we have found that the number of motors available for force generation is adjusted to the systolic force and SL, independent of the diastolic SL. The results are presented in a Manuscript submitted to Science. To understand the molecular basis of the LDA, here we have explored the structural changes induced on the thick myosin-containing filament by changes in SL in diastole, in the range of SL 1.9-2-3 µm.. Methods. The heart trabecula dissected from the rat ventricle was mounted in a thermoregulated trough perfused with oxygenated solution (1.2 ml/min, 27°C) and attached, via titanium double hooks, to the lever arms of a strain gauge force transducer and a loudspeaker motor carried on a moveable stage of a microscope. Sarcomere length (SL) was measured with a 40x dry objective and a 25x eyepiece. The length of the trabecula was adjusted to have an initial SL of ∼2.1 μm (L0). The stage was then vertically mounted in the hutch. A FReLoN CCD detector was placed at 30 m from the preparation to collect the first orders of the sarcomeric reflections with 1.6 ms time windows. Shorter and longer SL were obtained by changing the trabecula length by about ± 8% L0 and the corresponding sarcomeric reflections were recorded. The detector was then moved to 1.6 m to collect up to the 6th order of the myosin-based meridional reflections (time windows 10 ms) during diastole at the same trabecula lengths.</p><p>Results. The SL measured by the 2D patterns collected with 30 m camera length for the three different trabecula lengths were1.97 ± 0.01 µm, 2.11 ± 0.01 µm and 2.26 ± 0.01 µm, mean ± SE from 4 trabeculae. The patterns collected with 1.6 m camera length were normalised by the intensity of the equatorial 1,0 reflection at each SL to correct for the effects of the different diffracting mass in the X-ray path <ref type="bibr">(Reconditi et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr">, J. Physiol. 592, 1119)</ref>. The intensity distribution along the meridional axis of the X-ray pattern (parallel to the filament axis, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) is dominated by the myosin-based M3 reflection, originating from the axial repeat of the myosin motors; the other myosin-based reflections are the M6 (from the backbone periodicity) and the M2, M4, M5 forbidden reflections, due to a regular axial perturbation induced by the Myosin Binding Protein C (MyBP-C, that also contributes to the M1 reflection). The spacings and the fine structure of all the myosin reflections did not change significantly in the range of SL explored, while their intensities (corrected by the radial width change) increased with the increase of SL. These results indicate that in diastole the thick filament is in the OFF state (most of myosin motors folded back towards the centre of the sarcomere and the thick filament with a short periodicity). The increase in SL induces both a further increase in the number of motors in the OFF state and a higher order of the MyBP-C.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.
