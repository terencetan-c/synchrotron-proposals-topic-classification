<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the present paper, aliphatic thermoelastoplastics, consisting of alternating segments of polytet rahydrofuran and monodisperse segments of glycine and β alanine bisoxalamides, are studied. Phase transi tions and the orientation of crystals are determined by experiments using X ray structural analysis during the drawing process in situ. Two types of morphology have been revealed. Fibrillar crystals with chains oriented perpendicularly to the drawing direction are formed at low draw ratio values. At high deformation degrees, a fracture of large crystals and a reorientation of polymer chains along the drawing direction are observed. It is shown that the thickness of the hard block crystals is constant and independent of the sample thermal prehis tory. The tilting angle of bisoxalamide chains is determined using four spot small angle patterns. It turns out that in the case of glycine the tilting angle is rather small (~5-15°), while for alanine it reaches 24°. The flex ible block crystallization during the drawing process at room temperature was found regardless of the block length. The surface free energy of hard block crystals proved to be rather low (~18 erg/cm 2 ), which is probably due to the entropic contribution from flexible blocks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The latest advances in the field of creating ther moelastoplastics (TEPs) have caused interest in inves tigations of their structure and properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. As a rule, these materials possess a phase separated mor phology in the temperature range of their application, and the morphology depends on their chemical struc ture, molecular weight, and polydispersity of both soft and hard blocks, as well as on their thermal history. A special class of TEP is presented by segmented block copolymers with hard blocks of exactly identi cal lengths, which demonstrate the ability to quickly and completely crystallize. As a result, fibrillar crystals are formed consisting of hard segments surrounded by an amorphous matrix of soft segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. It is important to note that experimental methods such as AFM and DSC reveal a precise monodispersity of crystals in their thickness, which is uncharacteristic of partially crystalline polymers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The formation of such crystals monodisperse in their thickness in TEP based on segmented block copolymers is their impor tant advantage, since it allows a partially crystalline morphology, weakly dependent on the forming condi tions, to be obtained.</p><p>Structural transformations of TEPs upon their drawing were intensively studied with the use of vari ous methods. It has been established that two main stages of the structural reorganization of copolymers are observed upon their deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. At draw ratio values below the yield point, hard segments of chains in crystals are predominantly oriented perpen dicularly to the drawing direction. Above the yield point, a fragmentation of crystals occurs, and, as a result, hard segments become oriented along the draw axis. At high deformations, lamellae are fractured and form strongly loaded nanofibrils consisting of alternat ing hard and crystallized soft segments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. Experiments on small angle X ray diffraction showed the presence of a four spot pattern in relatively early stages of the drawing (about 5-150%), indicating the formation of a morphology with tilted crystals of hard blocks caused by a high characteristic ratio of their sides <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. For classical polyolefins, this phenome non is explained by a tilt of folded chains relative to the surface of lamellae <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. For the first time, the tilt ing angle of chains in polyethylene (PE) ϕ was calcu lated by Peterlin from the difference in large periods before and after the deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Later, the value ϕ was determined in experiments on X ray and elec tron diffraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Finally, our research group managed to obtain a precise tilting angle value for chains in bulk PE crystals, 35°, using the microfocus X ray diffraction method <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. To the best of our knowledge, the topic of chain tilting in crystals of phase separated block copolymers has not yet been thoroughly discussed in literature. This fact is due to the complicated character of studies of chain packing in nanometer scale fibrillar crystals attached chemi cally to flexible blocks of an amorphous matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Despite the complete crystallization of a hard block (the degree of crystallinity reaches 100%), its weight fraction in TEPs is, as a rule, low (25% at most), and this circumstance restricts the application of classical structural methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In the present work, a polymer system with a crystal structure defined in the synthesis stage is studied. To investigate the deformation behavior of poly(ether ether amides) (PEEA) under examination, X ray measurements were performed in situ in the drawing process of copolymer films. In particular, the orienta tion of crystals and phase transitions, occurring in both blocks, were studied. The morphology of ori ented segmented copolymers was also studied by the method of high temperature small angle X ray scat tering with the use of a synchrotron radiation source. In the present paper, the roles of the thickness and monodispersity of fibrillar crystals formed of hard blocks, as well as the low surface energy values calcu lated for these crystals, are discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAMPLES AND METHODS OF INVESTIGATION</head><p>The hard block of segmented PEEA consists of bisoxalamide with glycine end groups. The soft block is represented by polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) of vari able molecular weight. The samples are denoted as presented below (Scheme 1).</p><p>The synthesis of samples is described in detail in previous publications <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In scheme 1, n is the aver age molecular weight of PTHF (g/mol). The samples under investigation in the form of yellow transparent elastic films were prepared by melt extrusion followed by further cooling upon either quenching in a water/ice mixture or slow cooling from the melt with the rate 5°C/min.</p><p>Experiments on wide angle (WAXS) and small angle X ray scattering (SAXS) were carried out on the line BM26 of the European center of synchrotron radiation (Grenoble, France) with the use of the wave length 1.04 Å. For the measurements, two dimen sional FreLon detectors for WAXS and Pilatus 1M detectors for SAXS were used. The measured range of the modulus of the reciprocal space vector s (s = 2sinθ/λ, where θ is Bragg angle) was from 0.01 to 0.5 Å -1 . The scattering vector module in both config urations was calibrated by several diffraction orders of silver behenate. The diffraction signal was recorded in the transmission mode. In high temperature experi ments, the sample temperature was maintained with an accuracy of ±2°C. The crystal thicknesses (L c ) ðwere calculated from the scattering profile form obtained via the integration of two dimensional dif fraction patterns using the following expression:</p><p>.</p><p>(</p><p>Films used in experiments on their uniaxial draw ing were cut out of the cast films (3 × 10 × 1 mm 3 ).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>Using the results on X ray diffraction and IR spec troscopy, it was shown that the crystal structure of hard segments in block copolymers is close to that of the corresponding monomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Thus, it was important to investigate the structure of monomers forming hard segments. Needlelike single crystals of the monomer Gly Oxa 2 6 Gly (the hard block of samples 3 5) were prepared for TEM experiments. An example of X ray diffraction pattern obtained for Gly Oxa 2 6 Gly is pre sented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The observed diffraction peaks are assigned to the diffraction zone [02 1]. With the use of IR spectroscopy and X ray diffraction, it was revealed that the direction of hydrogen bonds is parallel to the crystal a (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In the case of polymers, the direction of hydrogen bonds is determined by the number of carbon atoms between oxalamide groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. One direction is observed for an even number of atoms in the spacer, while for an odd num ber two directions are observed. Since all monomers in our work have even numbers of carbon atoms in the spacer, the results agree with the literature data. The needle growth direction corresponds to the crystallo graphic direction {100}, as is seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>.</p><p>The indexing of electron diffraction patterns, cor responding to several diffraction zones, made it possi ble to determine that the cell of the monomer Gly Oxa 2 6 Gly is of the monoclinic type (symmetry C 2 )</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">c c 2 sin( ) ( ) ( ) n sL B I s A sL s ⎛ ⎞ π ∝ + ⎜ ⎟ π ⎝ ⎠ 0.94 cos hkl l λ = Δ ϑ</formula><p>and has the following parameters: a = 5.09 Å, b = 10.88 Å, c = 27.73 Å, and β = 79.6° (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The cal culated value of the interchain distance along the direction of hydrogen bonds corresponds to that char acteristic of nylon 6.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The ac projection of the Gly Oxa 2 6 Gly cell model is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>. The elementary cell contains two molecules, the neighbor ing molecules forming layers in the ac plane connected by hydrogen bonds. For a study of structural changes upon the defor mation of segmented PEEA films, in situ X ray dif fraction experiments were conducted directly during the drawing process. The obtained two dimensional diffraction patterns of sample 5 are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. As is seen from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, the original film is fully isotro pic with an amorphous halo at ca. 4.4 Å and crystalline 200 and 220 peaks (the spacings 2.48 Å, 2.30 Å, respectively) of the monoclinic bisoxalamide lattice. A schematic model of a nonoriented morphology, consisting of fibrillar crystals immersed into an amor phous matrix of soft blocks, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. At 50% deformation, a weak anisotropy is observed in samples, being revealed through an orientation of peaks corresponding to direction {100} along hydro gen bonds, in the meridian region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). Thus, sheets formed by hydrogen bonds are oriented parallel to the drawing axis (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). A similar orientation of crystallites with a high characteristic ration was observed earlier at small deformations by Niesten <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Versteegen <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> using IR spectroscopy. It should be noted that no crystal phase of the soft block is formed at low draw ratios. Above the yield point (for sample 5 it is about 100% <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>), spotlike crystalline reflections of bisoxalamide at the meridian and a diffuse layer line, corresponding to the PTHF crystal structure, appear. The latter arises due to orientational crystalli zation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. By analyzing periodicity along axis c, it was established that polytetrahydrofuran chains are oriented parallel to the drawing direction (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>). Upon further deformation (above 300%), PTHF crystalline peaks become more intense and bet ter oriented (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>). Details of the formation of the soft block crystal phase are described below. It is seen form Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref> that crystalline peaks of hard and soft blocks overlap. To get rid of this problem, films were heated above the PTHF melting temperature up to 80°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). It is seen in that case that 200 and 220 peaks are arranged at the equator, pointing to the fact that the c* axis of the cell of bisoxalamide is pre dominantly oriented along the drawing axis (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>). Thus, at high draw ratios, both hard and soft segments form micellar crystals with chains oriented parallel to  the drawing direction. This is in an agreement with the literature data, indicating that a fragmentation of crys tals and their reorientation along the mechanical stress direction occur above the yield point <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. The pres ence of a crystal phase of bisoxalamide provides good mechanical properties of the films at ambient temper atures, causing the effect of physical nodes of an entanglement network. In the small angle range, a sig nal is observed corresponding to the form factor of thickness uniform crystals of bisoxalamide. An isotro pic signal in the original films is transformed to a four spot pattern at deformation above 300% (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>). The formation of the tilted crystal morphology was earlier observed for block copolymers based on polyurethanes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, and its origin will be discussed below in more detail. Morphology formation in highly oriented films is essentially affected by the soft block length. In Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>, diffraction patterns of PEEA samples strained up to 300% with hard block Gly Oxa  (а) (b) (c) ϕ 1 2 3 4 Low elongation High elongation Fig. 3. Schematic model of structural changes in PEEA with hard blocks of the same length upon uniaxial deformation: (a) iso tropic sample, (b) morphology below the yield point, and (c) morphology above the yield point. The denoted structural elements: (1) hard block, (2) crystals of the hard block, (3) soft block, (4) crystals of the soft block, and (ϕ) the tilting angle of the hard block chains. The drawing direction is vertical.</p><p>It is important to note that, in contrast to the mono mer structure, where these reflections are weakly ori ented and arranged at the meridian, well oriented equatorial peaks are observed in segmented block copolymers. These differences are explained by spe cific features of the orientation of nanocrystallites. As was mentioned above, after defragmentation, layers formed by hydrogen bonds in segmented PEEA crys tals are oriented parallel to the drawing direction, forming characteristic micellar morphology. On the contrary, defragmentation is much more weakly pro nounced in the monomer and, as a result, the crystal growth axis is aligned along the extrusion direction.</p><p>Crystallization upon drawing leads to the forma tion of a highly oriented monoclinic phase of PTHF described in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. It is important to note that the formation of the crystal PTHF phase in isotropic samples is observed only at the block length above 1000 g/mol and temperatures below room tempera ture (the temperatures are equal to -16.4 and 3°C for samples 4 and 5, respectively). Using high tempera ture X ray analysis, the soft block melting tempera tures were compared in oriented and isotropic materi als. It turned out that, for drawn samples, the value of T m rises by more than 60°C. Similar results were obtained for TFT PTHF block copolymers with the same hard block <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. An increase in the soft block length also gives rise to a growth of the crystal size along the drawing direction. Thus, the correlation length calculated from the Selyakov-Scherrer equa tion for reflection 11 5 increases more than twice upon a lengthening of the PTHF block from 2000 (4) to 2900 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. A hardening of the material upon its draw ing due to the soft block crystallization brings about a 75% increase in the tensile strength and elongation at a break of sample 5 when compared to those of sam ple 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>SAXS measurements were used for to calculate the primary crystal parameters for the hard phase. As was expected, the thickness of bisoxalamide crystals (L c ) calculated from the position of the crystal form fac tors is determined by the hard block length and is inde pendent of the soft segment length (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). One dimensional SAXS curves of oriented samples 4-5 based on Gly Oxa 2 6 Gly are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. It is seen that the form factor intensity decreases by more than twice with a growth of the hard block content  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> that a slight thickening of bisoxalamide crystals is observed upon drawing. Supposing that this "thickening" depends on the spacer length, it may be concluded that alkyl chains between oxalamide monomers adopt a more extended conformation upon deformation.</p><p>Tilting angles of hard blocks with respect to the crystal surface were calculated from the azimuthal position of form factor peaks in a four spot SAXS pat</p><p>0.40 200 HS 0.45 s, Å -1 220 HS I, arb. units (а) (b) (c) 200 HS 220 HS ϕ = 5°ϕ = 14°1 10 020 130 200 22 5 11 5 Equator Layer line l = 5 Four spot SAXS signal Fig. 5.

It was assumed that, since the c* axis of the cell of bisoxalamide is parallel to the draw axis, the chain tilting in the crystal is directly related to the tilting morphology of drawn films. It should be noted that, although the value ϕ changes from one sample to another, it stays constant above the yield point (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The ϕ values increase from 5 to 25° for samples with a long PTHF block.</p><p>Using the results on the crystal thickness L c and melting temperature T m , the surface energy of crystals σ e was calculated via the Gibbs-Thompson equation: ,</p><p>where is the melting temperature of an infinitely thick crystal; ρ is the crystal density. The calculation showed that the value σ e = 18 erg/cm 2 is identical for all block copolymers. This value is noticeably lower when compared to common homopolymers <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Such behavior is related to the fact that the surface energy value is underestimated by the Gibbs-Thomp son equation for needlelike crystals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.

In our case, a low surface energy value is probably due to the entropic contribution from the connecting flexible blocks, preventing a merge of growing hard block crys tals with the formation of a classical lamellar structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In the present work, new polymer TEP based on segmented PEEA with the crystal size determined pre cisely by the hard block chemical structure were inves tigated. A structural model of the monomer bisoxala mide was suggested based on an analysis of X ray and electron diffraction data. It was revealed for block copolymers that the hard block structure matches the monomer structure with the direction of hydrogen bonds along the crystal a axis. The crystal thickness is strictly monodisperse, being determined in the stage of the block copolymer synthesis. Also, in situ investiga tions of structural changes in the material upon its deformation were carried out. Two types of morphol ogy were revealed. At low degrees of deformation, the physical network is destroyed, and this leads to the ori entation of crystals along the drawing direction, poly mer chains being perpendicular to the deformation axis. At high degrees of deformation, the fragmenta tion of bisoxalamide crystals occurs, being accompa nied by the orientation of chains along the drawing direction. The tilting angles of chains relative to the crystal surface were calculated from four spot diffrac tion patterns. Furthermore, it turned out that the sur face energy values calculated from structural and ther mophysical characteristics are nearly the same and rather low, which is due to geometrical restrictions during the crystallization process. The results are of importance for understanding the relationship between the crystal structure and the morphology of products with macroscopic properties of the new class of materials.</p><p>It should be noted that the developed materials are also of significant potential in the field of nanotech nology. Thus, compared to segmented copolymers on the basis of polyurethanes, segmented PEEA have a higher decomposition temperature, exceeding their melting temperature, and this fact makes their pro cessing more adaptable to streamlined production. Moreover, PEEA copolymers are also characterized by a high chemical stability, flexibility at low tempera tures, strength, and elasticity. These properties make them applicable for the production of foams, elas tomer fibers, adhesives, fabrics, and sportswear. Fur thermore, an interesting combination of structural parameters with excellent mechanical and surface properties makes it possible to use these copolymers for the production of hi tech medical items, in partic ular, catheters.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
