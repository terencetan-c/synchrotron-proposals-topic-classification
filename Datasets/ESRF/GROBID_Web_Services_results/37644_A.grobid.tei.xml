<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report (preliminary):</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to determine the short-range arrangement of atoms in Na 0.5 Bi 0.5 TiO 3 (NBT) relaxor ferroelectric by means of the x-ray diffuse scattering holography. Our plan was to measure the x-ray holograms using the anomalous diffuse scattering from the Bi atoms at photon energies close to the bismuth L III absorption edge (13.419 keV). The real-space reconstruction of these holograms results in the local neighbourhood of bismuth cations providing thus the short-range order information.</p><p>Finally, with respect to the possibility to reach very high energies at the ID11 beamline, we decided to carry out the experiment using the bismuth K-edge at 90.526 keV. Although the variations of the real-part of the form factor at the K-edge are smaller than those at the L-edge, this disadvantage seems to be compensated by negligible absorption in the sample and by very low scattering in the air.</p><p>The sample was the NBT single crystal (rhombohedral, space group R3c) in the form of a 50 µm thick plate, the sample surface was parallel to the (111) crystallographic plane (using the notation of a pseudocubic unit cell). The sample was illuminated by a monochromatic beam of the cross-section of 200×200 µm 2 . The intensity patterns were recorded in the transmission mode using a large CCD detector (array of 2048×2048 pixels of the size of 51×51 µm 2 ) positioned at the distance of 200 mm behind the sample. The reciprocal space was scanned by rotating the sample around the axis perpendicular to the incident beam in the range from -180° to 180°. We measured such a large region of the reciprocal space because we want to reconstruct the local atomic structure without using the "long-range" symmetry deduced on the basis of Bragg reflections. The sample was moving during each exposure in 0.5° steps. The acquisition time for each step was chosen between 3 s and 25 s depending on the energy; the aim was to get diffuse scattering patterns without an oversaturation of detector pixels when passing through the Bragg reflections. Data were collected at photon energies E 1 = 90.5 keV (at the absorption edge), E 2 = 90.9keV (above the edge), and E 3 = 80 keV (below the edge). Several data sets were collected for each energy in order to improve the data precission.</p><p>The most critical part of holography experiment consists in the data processing. First, the background and the scattering from the air have to be subtracted using scattering patterns collected with no sample present. The data have to be corrected carefully also for the fluorescence, the inelastic scattering, the beam polarization, the absorption in the sample, and the detector efficiency. It is also necessary to remove numerically the intense Bragg reflections using a median filter. Then sets of the corrected experimental data points can be transformed into a regular grid in the reciprocal space resulting in 3D diffuse scattering patterns. Finally, the difference of the intensity patterns collected at two energies with different contributions of the anomalous scattering can be treated as a hologram and the realspace image can be reconstructed by using the inverse Fourier transform. This procedure is time-consuming and it has not been finished yet, because all corrections have to be done with the precision of the order of 1 percent of the measured signal in order to get a good hologram. However, we have already some preliminary results. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows a three-dimensional map of the reciprocal space constructed by using a set of 720 diffuse scattering patterns collected at the energy of 80 keV. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> represents the mesured intensities partially corrected using the procedures described above, it is not a hologram. Inspite of "non-ideal" data processing, the inverse Fourier transform provides the local pair distribution function (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) with clear peaks corresponding to all atomic pairs. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows that there is no chess-board alternation of Na and Bi cations. But the main question, i.e. wheather the bismuth atoms are grouped together or not, requires more extensive data processing.</p><p>Although a lot of work has to be done before extracting all the information from the experimental data, the use of the diffuse scattering holography seems to be very promising for the study of the short-range ordering in ferroelectric materials.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Sincrotrone Trieste, S.
