<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the experiment was to reveal Fe trafficking pathways during Fe/S cluster biosynthesys in the SufBC2D protein complex. In order to do so, we applied Fe K-edge XAS to the SufBC2D complex and to selected subunits at different stages of the Fe/S cluster assembly reaction. Our hypothesis, supported by biochemical assays performed at our home laboratory, was that flavin (FADH2) triggers Fe transportation between different subunits of the Suf complex, delivering the metal to the B subunit where the Fe/S cluster is formed. XAS measurements confirmed our hypothesis, and suggested a complex scenario for Fe/S cluster biosynthesis, including unexpected intermediate steps of the reaction that will be the subject of futur studies.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Fe K-edge XAS spectra were acquired in the He cryostat of BM30B, at 15 K. Protein solutions were prepared in our home laboratory, incubated with Fe, FADH and/or SSH, then deposited on the sample holder equipped with kapton windows and immediately frozen in LN2, in order to trap the desired reaction steps. 1Fe/protein complex was added, limiting the Fe concetration in the sample to the maximum concetration allowed not to induce denaturation of Suf complexes, i.e. 1.8-2.0 mM. Being Fe extremely diluted, up to 12h integration were necessary to reach 10 6 photon counts after the absorption edge with a 30-elements Ge detector. In order to avoid radiation damage, different spectra of ~45 min each (over 1 keV energy range) were acquired on different spots of the frozen drops.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We could acquire high quality XAS spectra that revealed that both FADH2 and SSH induce reduction from Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ in the SufBC2D complex and a variation of Fe coordination environment, as suggested by the shift towards lower energies and the change in XANES spectral features (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). EXAFS data could be extracted and Fourier-transformed in the range [2.5-10] Å -1 for all samples, in the range [2.5-12.5] Å -1 for most concentrated samples. Fourier-transformed data were subjected to first-shell analysis in order to retrieve the number and nature of Fe ligands. First-shell analysis revealed that Fe is mobilized from a 5-coordinated N/O shell to a 4coordinated environment where S ligands are present (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) upon addition of FADH2 or SSH. The number of N/O and S atoms is not the same in the two 4-coordinated environments, suggesting two different Fe trafficking pathways. Surprisingly, we found that the reaction with FADH2 and SSH leads to an intermediate Fe/S cluster formation, where two Fe atoms are bridged by S ligands (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). On the basis of first-shell analysis results, a 2Fe2S cluster model with two bridging cysteine residues was built and fitted to experimental EXAFS data, directly in the k-space. This model provides an excellent agreement with the experimental spectrum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>), and allowed us to measure first-shell distances with high precision (Fe-S = 2.298±0.007 Å, Fe-Fe= 2.742±0.008 Å).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perspectives</head><p>This XAS experiment revealed novel Fe trafficking pathways during biosynthesis of Fe/S clusters by the Suf proteins, and completed the scenario suggested by biochemical characterization and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The results are the subject of a publication in preparation to be submitted to a high-impact journal. New synthesis routes were observed, which would deserve deeper investigation: the pre-formation of a Fe/S cluster, its dependence on the reactants stoichiometric ratios and on the multi-steps reaction sequence. Clarifying these issues would bring further insight into the Fe/S assembly mechanism. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
