<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment on the dynamics of colloids was proposed for the ID10C beamline. This beamline is expected to generate coherent beams of much higher intensity than station ID10A. However, <ref type="bibr">ID10C</ref> was not yet open to users at the time of the experiment. Instead we performed experiments at the ID10A station, which were aimed at enhancing the flux of the primary beam by pre-focusing the beam onto the entrance of the waveguide. This will greatly facilitate later XPCS experiments.</p><p>We have performed x-ray waveguiding <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> experiments in conjunction with a transmission Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP), which focuses the beam in one dimension. The FZP was fabricated by Ch. David at the Laboratory for Macrostructures and Nanostructures (LMN) at the Paul Scherrer Institute. The FZP increases the coherent flux inside the waveguide by focusing the 150 micron wide coherent x-ray beam into a line focus at the entrance of the waveguide which has a width of a few hundred nanometers. This increase in flux is needed for X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) experiments on thin confined fluids. The zone plate pattern was applied with electron beam lithography and subsequent wet-etching of a silicon wafer of 50 micron thickness. The transmission of 13.3 keV x rays through the 50 micron membrane is 85%. The zone plate consists of ribbons with a height of 10 microns, each resulting in a phase shift of p of the incident beam. The width of the outermost Fresnel zone is 326 nm. This FZP has only two height levels and therefore has a limited focusing efficiency of ~ 25% compared to a 'perfect' FZP with curved Fresnel zones. The diffraction limited focus width is equal to the outermost zone width of 326 nm at full illumination. The theoretical gain in intensity in the focus is a factor ∼37. The focal distance is 72 cm. The lens used in the experiments is shown in the electron microscopy picture in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The waveguide set-up is schematically drawn in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. In front of the waveguide a pre-reflection creates a sinusoidal standing wave pattern which can be matched to the TE modes of the waveguide by tuning the angle of incidence. In this experiment, the incident plane wave is focused onto the entrance of the waveguide.</p><p>The intensity of the far-field diffraction pattern of the electric field at the end of the waveguide is measured by a 2D detector at 129 cm from the exit. By changing the angle of incidence the intensity distribution is obtained as a function of incidence and exit angle. When the mode spacing is smaller than the angular spread in the focus, multiple modes are excited coherently. This is visible in the countour plot in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, which shows the measured intensity distribution I(θ i ,θ e ) versus incidence and exit angle for a waveguide width of 1200 nm. The small horizontal lines on the diagonal indicate excitation of modes over a ~0.01 range of incidence angles. In fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> the far field diffraction pattern is shown for a gap of only 150 nm. The incidence angle is 0.021, in between two modes (mode TE 0 and TE 1 are both excited). The integrated intensity is about a factor 8 higher with lens than without lens. This gain is lower than the theoretical gain factor of 37, because of non-flatness of the wave front falling onto the lens, and non-uniform illumination of over the lens height. Small modifications to the beamline and the setup should make an experimental gain factor of ~20 feasible. But ID10A provides insufficient mechanical stability for experiments with micron-sized beams on sub-micron sized samples.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Scanning electron microscope image of the one dimensional Fresnel Zone Plate designed to work at 13.3 keV.
