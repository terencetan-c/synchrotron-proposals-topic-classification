<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The bifunctional bacterial enzyme N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU) catalyses acetyltransfer from acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) to glucosamine-1-P (GlcN-1-P) with release of GlcNAc-1-P, and subsequently uridyltransfer from UTP to GlcNAc-1-P in the presence of Mg <ref type="bibr">2+</ref> , yielding PPi and the nucleotide-activated precursor sugar UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc is the main precursor for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, and the absence of a bifunctional enzyme equivalent to GlmU in eukaryotes, makes this enzyme an attractive target for the design of new antibiotics.</p><p>We have solved the structure of the full-length enzyme from Streptococcus pneumoniae by Se-Met MAD at beamline BM14 (in the year 1999) and collected data for complexes with substrates, reaction intermediate and the final product at beamlines ID14-EH2 and ID14-EH3 (in first part of the year 2000).</p><p>The enzyme assembles into a trimeric arrangement, with the LβH acetyltransferase domains packed tightly against each other in a parallel fashion, and the uridyltransferase domains being projected away from the threefold axis by a long α-helical arm. AcCoA binding induces the formation of a long and narrow tunnel, enclosed between two adjacent LβH domains and the interchanged C-terminal region of the third subunit, giving rise to an original active site architecture at the junction of three subunits. Clear difference density could be observed for bound acetyl-CoA, UDP-GlcNAc, UTP and Mg 2+ , giving insight both into substrate recognition and reaction mechanism. GlcNAc viewed down the LβH axis</p><p>GlmU represents an attractive target for the development of new antibiotics. In order to get insight into the exact mode of binding of the natural substrate for the acetyltransferase reaction and of a potential inhibitor developed by our industrial co-workers, we have collected data on crystals soaked in GlcN-1-P and RO on beamline ID14-EH3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Dengue has recently been classified by the World Health Organization as a priority in emerging diseases due to increasing epidemics over the past 20 years. Dengue, dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are prevalent in over 100 countries and threaten the health of more than 2.5 billion people, living in tropical and subtropical regions. The annual incidence is estimated to be in the tens of millions, with an estimated 500 000 hospitalized cases of DHF/DSS, 90% of whom are children under the age of 15 years.</p><p>The average mortality rate is 5%, with some 24 000 deaths each year. A specific cure for dengue does not exist, the treatment is largely supportive. Vaccination strategies are complicated by the presence of four serotypes DEN-1, 2, 3 and 4 present in all tropical areas around the world.</p><p>Dengue belongs to the flavivirus subgroup of the Flaviviridae family comprising several other important human pathogens like yellow fever and encephalitis viruses. The other two subgroups consist of pestiviruses (bovine viral diarrhea, classical swine fever) and hepatitis C viruses. Dengue virus contains a single positivestranded RNA genome which has a type 1 cap at its 5' end and is translated directly into a polyprotein. The polyprotein is subsequently processed by viral and host cell protease activities to produce three structural and seven non-structural proteins. Enzyme activities which are essential for virus replication are associated with the non-structural proteins. In particular, proteins NS3 and NS5 were described to interact in vivo and in vitro to constitute the RNA replicase complex. NS3 presents several activities associated with virus replication:</p><p>NTPase, helicase and RNA binding, and a protease activity within the N-terminal 167 residues.</p><p>The cap is a structure which is essential for both mRNA stability and for binding to the ribosome during translation. It is found at the 5'-end of viral and cellular eukaryotic mRNA. mRNA capping results of three chemical reactions: The 5'-triphosphate of the mRNA is first converted to a diphosphate by an RNA triphosphatase. The second reaction is a transfer of a GMP moiety from GTP to the 5'-diphosphate RNA by the guanylyltransferase (capping enzyme) to yield G 5' -ppp 5' -N. In a third reaction utilizing S-adenosyl-Lmethionine as the methyl donor, the transferred guanosine moiety is methylated by a methyltransferase at its N7 position to yield 7Me G 5' -ppp 5' -N (cap 0 structure). In some instances, a second methyl transfer reaction methylates the 2'-OH of the first nucleotide 3' to the triphosphate bridge to yield 7Me G 5' -ppp 5' -N 2'0Me (cap 1 structure).</p><p>We reasoned that structural insights into viral RNA capping and its inhibition would help the rational design of inhibitors directed against This domain has been purified, crystallized and its structure has been solved by the MAD method on BM14. This work has been described in the previous BAG report. In order to get futher insights into the CEF mecanism and to corroborate some biochemical results, we needed to get the crystal structure of CEF in complex with substrates or substrate analogues. Examination of the crystal packing shows some large chanels suitable for the diffusion of small molecules. Three data sets have been collected on three crystals which have been soaked in mycophenolic acid, GMP, and a GTP analogue, respectively. The data collection statistics are given below:</p><p>Space group Resolution (A) cell Rmerge (%) completeness redundancy Mycophenolic acid P3121 3.0 111.8 111.8 55.7 17.1 96.5 3.5 GMP P3121 2.8 112.2 112.2 56.3 6.8 97.7 4.4 GTP analogue P3121 2.7 112.2 112.2 56.46 4.4 99.0 4.0</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FigureFigure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 1: 1.75 Å resolution averaged 2Fo-Fc Figure 2: Ribbon diagram of the GlmU map calculated prior inclusion of AcCoA into trimer with bound AcCoA and UDPthe model (1.0 σ, blue; 3.0 σ, black).GlcNAc viewed down the LβH axis</figDesc><graphic coords="4,81.40,36.84,84.92,156.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Flaviviruses. NS5 was shown to exhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity producing double-stranded RNA and sequence analyses localized the polymerase activity to the Cterminal domain of NS5 (Pol-domain). The N-terminal domain is expected, on the basis of sequence comparison studies, to present an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-utilizing methyltransferase activity (MTase domain) that has not been demonstrated yet. Based on three dimensional structure prediction and sequence analysis, a thirty-three kDa N-terminal domain of NS5 of the Dengue virus type 2 (New Guinea) was cloned and expressed in a soluble form in E. This domain is referred to as CEF (Capping Enzyme of Flavivirus).</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>After molecular replacement and refinement, the Fourier difference maps were inspected. An extra density was found in the case of the GTP analogue. These data were refined between 30 and 2.7 A resolution to an R factor of 21.3 (FreeR of 24.1). Neither GMP nor mycophenolic acid bound to CEF. We used a new crystal form of mouse acetylcholinesterase (AchE) that permits more accurate studies of the peripheral anionic site of this enzyme. This new crystal form diffracts up to 2.2 Å resolution and contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit, with the catalytic gorge entrance being freely solvent accessible in each subunit. This differs from the previous 3 Å resolution structure (1) for which only one molecule out of two possessed a solvent-accessible gorge entrance. In addition, the previous crystal form grew with a high salt concentration compared to a low salt concentration required for the new crystal form, a critical parameter to study ligands directed to the peripheral anionic site. We used a new compound that displays high affinity for this site and performed co-crystallization experiments with AChE using large excess of this compound. Indeed, previous data from similar crystals soaked with similar compounds showed only partial occupancies. Data obtained from these crystals are of excellent quality. For these two structures, rigid-body refinement was then performed on each subunit with CNS using data between 30 Å and 3 Å and gave an R-factor and R-free value of 25.4. For 2% of the reflections against which the two models were not refined, R-free was 24.9%. Refinement of this two structure is underway at 2.25 Å resolution. The final model will be used for a comparative study with other peripheral ligands for which data have been recently collected at ESRF. References: (1) Bourne, Y., Taylor, P. &amp; Marchot, P.
