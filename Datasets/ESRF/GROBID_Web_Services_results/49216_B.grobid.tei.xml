<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Comparison of several twin copy panels from Bruegel with different state of degradation of mercury sulfide by micro-XANES Four samples were analyzed during this experiment, coming from three major paintings from P. Bruegel the Younger: "Preaching of John the Baptist" (Lier, Belgium), "The Village Lawyer" (Ghent, Belgium) and "The Wedding Dance" (Ghent, Belgium). From the first painting, two samples were taken from the red coat of a figure in the right, one in the shadow (C006) and one in a degraded area (C007). Both samples present a thick preparation layer with calcite and lead white. Above this, two superimposed layers of red mercury sulfide are visible, seperated by a varnish layer. On top of them, some black crusts are present below the superficial varnish. From the second painting, one sample was taken from the red dress of the bending woman in the center (C012). From the last painting, one sample was taken from the red shirt of the man in the center (C052). (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>)</p><p>A micrometric beam (0.5 x 0.2 µm² -hor x ver) was necessary for the study of these cross-sections composed of multiple micrometric layers. For each sample, chemical maps were acquired and XANES spectra at Cl and S K-edges were collected. After acquisition, data were analyzed using PyMCA 1 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>As chlorine was already proven to be involved in the alteration of red mercury sulfide 2 , the presence of this element was studied first by µ-XRF. Maps acquired on the different samples at high energy (7.9 keV) showed that chlorine was present in the cross-sections and in almost all layers (preparation, picturial) (see Cl map for sample C007 Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). The only sample taken from a non-degraded area (C006) also showed the presence of chlorine, but the concentration of this element seemed to be homogeneous in all layers of the cross-section.</p><p>For the three others samples, chlorine seemed to be present in higher concentration on top of red mercury sulfide layers. µ-XANES spectra were acquired in different points of these samples in order to identify the chlorine species visible in XRF maps. On areas were chlorine was high concentrated (on C007, C012 and C052), a peak typical for mercury chlorine compounds with energy of maximum absortion at 2.8232 keV was present in Cl K-edge spectra. Nevertheless the absence of clear features on these spectra did not allow the identification of a specific phase. On the other areas of all samples, Cl K-edge spectra showed one peak with an energy of maximum absorption at 2.8242 keV, slightly higher than the white line of mercury chlorine references (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>). µ-XANES spectra at S K-edge just shows the presence of red mercury sulfide (2.4716 keV) and a peak corresponding to the energy of maximum absorption for sulfates (2.4825 keV).</p><p>Unfortunately, XANES spectra acquired on these four samples from Brueghel the Younger's panels did not allow a clear identification of the different chlorine containing compounds which seem to be present in the cross-sections. In these samples, chlorine seemed to be present in all layers, which could be indicating that the binder used by the painter contains this element and is then a potential source of this element which could directly degrade the red mercury sulfide pigment with the action of light. To have a better idea of the disposition of these compounds, maps were acquired at these two energies and at the energy of chlorine in mercury chlorine compounds (2.8232 keV). Layers of original pigment (α-HgS) were visible and for C007, C012 and C052 maps acquired at 2.8232 keV showed that this type of chlorine containing compounds were present on top of picturial layers. For C007, these chlorine phases were present above an opening presented by the higher α-HgS layer, and not above the lower one (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>). A sulfate layer is visible on top of all samples, and for C007 a thin layer of sulfate is also present between the two picturial layers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>).</p><p>These samples are still under study in order to explain the difference between C006 (from non-degraded area) and the other samples. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Marie Radepont a,b* , Marine Cotte a,c* , Koen Janssens b , Jana Sanyova a* , Emeline Pouyet c* , Willemien Anaf b* .

In these paintings, vermilion presents degraded areas with grey crusts on its surface. The direct comparison of paint samples obtained from related artworks would give a better insight into the factors influencing the alteration of this pigment.</figDesc></figure>
