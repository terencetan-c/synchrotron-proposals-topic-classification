<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific background</head><p>High-pressure theoretical 1,2 and experimental 3 investigations of AlH 3 reported that the application of pressure transformed the rhombohedral alpha-phase of alane into high pressure phases hp1 and hp2. However discrepancies still remained and the strucutre of the hp1 phase</p><p>was not yet somved experimentally. The aim of this project was to solve the structure of the hp1 phase using single-crystal angle dispersive diffraction and to propose a new equation of state of alane in the pressure range 0-120 GPa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental technique</head><p>Wide aperture (35° cone) membrane diamond anvil cells (MDAC) equiped with Almax-Boehler anvils of 100*300 microns culets have been used. Single crystals of AlH 3 had been previously loaded in neon in our laboratory (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). Angle-dispersive single-crystal diffraction was be carried out using a monochromatic beam (0.414036 Å) focused to 10-15 microns. The samples were rotated about a vertical axis from -20° to 20° to take advantage of the wide cell aperture while not contaminating the CCD with scattering from the experimental apparatus. Images were be collected in steps of 1 degree using the online MAR555 detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Single-crystal angle dispersive diffraction allowed us to determine that phase hp1 had a very poor crystallization rate, which can explain the difficulties encountered by the previous studies to determine its structure. However we found that this phase could be described with a monoclinic unit cell.</p><p>Upon increasing pressure we confirmed the phase hp2 previously solved though it can be noted that the transition appeared at a pressure 7 GPa higher than what was previously reported.</p><p>Using the results collected on ID9 we were able to propose a slightly revised equation of state of alane shown on figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: a) View of the sample used on ID9, left: alane at 8 GPa, right: the same sample at 120 GPa. b) Equation of state deduced from our measurements</figDesc><graphic coords="3,30.26,251.12,528.11,236.97" type="bitmap" /></figure>
