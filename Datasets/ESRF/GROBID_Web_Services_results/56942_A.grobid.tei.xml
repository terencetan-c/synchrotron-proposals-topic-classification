<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dear Jon Otto, I am sorry to hear that your experiment were not successful. I spoke to your team before they left, and they seemed quite optimistic. However, it is clear that your in-situ experiment did not really work as well as planned, despite the fact that you received the full 9 shifts which you requested in your proposal. Some clarification is necessary. Indeed, the first 2 days of beamtime were spent trying to find a suitable arrangement for your experiment. Your requirements are by no means standard, and I know that our beamline staff put in a lot of effort to come up with a good solution. There were no serious leaks of water into the sample cell, since the cell could be both evacuated and pressurized successfully. It is a sealed system. The problem concerned the dehydration of your sample. It is not clear to me where the origin of the problem lies, but I suspect that perhaps the "dry" nitrogen supplied by the ESRF is not as dry as it should be. Maybe it would have been better to use nitrogen from a gas bottle instead. It would evidently be a good idea to have some beamtime to evaluate different in-situ arrangements, and to ensure that all the technical problems for your experiment have been resolved. I would therefore like to suggest that you or someone from your staff come to the ESRF during the single-bunch beamtime (15-20 September 2015). I believe that this would be a good opportunity to ensure that the set-up is working well before your next official beamtime in October. If you agree, then please let me know in good time so that the necessary arrangements can be made. I will also extend your allocation of beamtime in October up to 15 shifts (ie beginning on the morning of 29 Oct and finishing on the morning of 3 November 2015). Hopefully, the additional beamtime will allow you to bring these experiments to a successful conclusion. Regards, Phil Pattison Quoting Jon Otto Fossum &lt;jon.fossum@ntnu.no&gt;: &gt; dear phil (copy to dmitry and leander) &gt; our experiment did not go so well this time, there were serious &gt; leaks of water into the the sample cell, meaning that when we &gt; finally found a kind of solution to the problem, 2 days of beamtime &gt; was already lost, so we could not start real data collection until &gt; friday afternoon (july 17th). &gt; from the previous email below, i had misunderstood that it would be &gt; possible for us also to take data during today july 18th, but is &gt; seems we were were taken off the beamline already in the morning? &gt; (i'm still in grenoble, but was not at the beamline in the morning). &gt; all in all this experiment was not successful for us, and i doubt we &gt; can get anything publishable out of it. &gt; brgds &gt; jon</p></div>		</body>
