<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Hydrotreating reactions are used to substantially reduce the content of sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, and aromatics of petroleum feedstocks and these reactions constitute one of the most important steps in refining <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Among the most common catalysts in hydrotreating are the tungsten(or molybdenum)-based materials promoted by Ni or Co. A major question still remains regarding how Ni(CO) is situated and what kind of interaction exists between W(Mo) and the promoter <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. However, EXAFS data at the Ni K-edge have yielded limited information so far, since good quality data is restricted by the low promoter concentration and the simultaneous presence of W. The aim of this work was to collect good quality Ni Kedge EXAFS data by increasing the accumulation time of the data points during the measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>The catalysts were pressed in self-supported wafers, sulfided in the chemistry laboratory and mounted in a sealed EXAFS cell. In this work, we investigate the progress of sulfidation of alumina-supported tungstenbased catalysts prepared from an oxidic precursor, WO 3 , and from a sulfidic precursor, ammonium tetrathiotungstate (ATT).</p><p>Ni-K edge EXAFS spectra were recorded in transmission mode at liquid nitrogen temperature. The program XDAP -version 2.3.3 was used to analyze and fit the data as described in the literature <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>EXAFS data were recorded after the sulfidation of the catalysts and the Fourier transformed of the experimental and fitted data of Ni-WO 3 and Ni-ATT catalysts are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The sulfided Ni-WO 3 catalyst (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) was fitted with one oxygen shell and one sulfur shell that, due to their proximity, overlap in the region from 1.1 to 2.1 Å (not phase-corrected). In the case of the Ni-ATT catalyst (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), a good fit was only achieved with two sulfur shells. The shells are then shifted to a higher R region, ranging from 1.6 to 2.4 Å (not phase-corrected). The Ni-O contribution lies at the same distance as the one found for cubic NiO, in which nickel atoms are octahedrally surrounded by six oxygen atoms. In the case of the ATT catalyst, nickel is completely sulfided and has a lower coordination number. Two sulfur shells are identified for this catalyst at distances of 2.2 Å and another lying in the region between 2.36 and 2.43 Å.</p><p>Sulfidation of the Ni-ATT catalysts at 150°C mainly forms the Ni-S coordination at 2.2 Å, which transforms to the longer Ni-S coordination at 2.35 Å during sulfidation at 400°C. This fact is believed to be due to the combination of nickel sulfide with WS 2 to form the NiWS phase.</p></div>
