<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The mechanism of primary nucleation in polymer crystallization is still a highly debated area 1-3 , with continuing investigations experimentally and theoretically being performed. Here, several experiments have been performed which investigate the isothermal and shear-induced crystallization kinetics of novel polyethylene systems 1 . The polymers studied have been specially synthesized in the Sheffield University Chemistry Department and are collectively described as model hydrogenated polybutadienes, having novel molecular architectures. The model polymers are monodisperse systems, which have been blended with similar monodisperse 'comb' systems which have varying degrees of long chain branching (LCB), the architectures are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. These blends are mixed at levels below and equal to the C* entanglement weight of the comb additive system. Experimental</p><p>We have investigated the long chain branching effects of the blended model polymer systems by performing crystallization experiments having been subjected to flow and comparison isothermal processing conditions. These blends have been subjected to a pulse of constant shear units in a flat plate shear cell system, at the desired crystallization temperature. Generally, the development of crystallization and thus structural morphology in these materials, has been followed using Small Angle X-Ray scattering (SAXS) techniques on BM26b at the ESRF. 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 1.10 1.20 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Time /sec Normalised intensity /Arb 377K iso 375K shear 377K shear 379K shear 0.00 0.10 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.50 0.60 0.70 0.80 0.90 1.00 1.10 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 Time /sec Normalized invariant /Arb 370K iso 370K 373K 375K 373K iso Blend D: 4 sec frames (shear @100s-1 for 5 sec) 373K 400sec 375K 400sec 370K 400sec Blend C: 4 sec frames (shear @100s-1 for 5 sec) 379K 400sec 377K 400sec 375K 480sec Figure 2. Scattering patterns and integrated SAXS data graphs for time resolved shear-induced crystallization of blended hydrogenated polybutadienes.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, shows SAXS patterns and integrated SAXS data with respect to time of the shear-induced crystallization of blended linear samples with 10% of comb samples . Normally the shearing of the linear monodisperse sample will give little orientation as the relaxation times are fast with the molecular weights used here. However, blending with a small amount of comb of similar M w (backbone) as the linear sample will give increased crystallization rates and some obvious orientation in the SAXS. Crystallization rates are still increased in these blends compared with isothermal crystallization conditions, even if no orientation is seen at higher crystallization temperatures.</p><p>From scattering experiments of the model blended systems, it has been seen that during flow the crystallization kinetics are increased greatly compared to that of the isothermal crystallization at the same temperature 1 . Shear-induced crystallization in the model systems are seen to give rise to oriented 'shish-kebab' morphologies to varying degrees 1 , depending upon the composition of the blend and crystallization temperature. However, the shear-induced crystallization kinetics in the blended systems were still increased (compared to isothermal conditions) even though no 'orientation' was observed in the SAXS data collected, shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, with blend D.</p><p>These results have lead to the development of greater theoretical understanding of crystallization kinetics at the molecular level 2-3 , using these model systems compared with poorly defined polydisperse commercial polymers. The advancement in in-situ processing equipment, improved data quality and rapid collection times using synchrotron radiation, has also allowed a deeper insight into the early crystallization mechanisms to be explored. 1) Shear induced crystallization of Polyethylene studied by Small-and Wide-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS/WAXS) techniques.
