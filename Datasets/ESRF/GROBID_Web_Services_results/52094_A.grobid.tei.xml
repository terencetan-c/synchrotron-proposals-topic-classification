<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Report 25-02-813</head><p>The exotic polymorph ε-Fe 2 O 3 exhibits a polar ferrimagnetic structure with T c around 500 K. It presents a huge coercivity at RT and is isomorphous to the reference multiferroic GaFeO 3 , which exhibits gigantic optical magnetoelectric effects albeit with a lower T c around 210 K. The recent stabilization of ε-Fe 2 O 3 thin films epitaxially grown on SrTiO 3 (111) by PLD technique offers the unique opportunity to study the structural properties of this system at a nearly "single crystal" level. Structural changes coupled to high and low temperature magnetic transitions were previously detected inε-Fe 2 O 3 phase stabilized in form of nanoparticles.</p><p>The experiment allowed characterising the structure of the films revealing the existence of 12 different in-plane domains: six along the SrTiO3 diagonals and the remaining six at 30 degrees with respect to the former. We could confirm that the room temperature structure of ε-Fe 2 O 3 is described in the Pna2 1 spacegroup as for nanoparticles and the bulk isostructural oxides GFeO 3 and AlFeO 3 .The ε-Fe 2 O 3 films were grown on STO(111) after depositing a seed layer of the isomorphous structure AlFeO 3 . Films of AlFeO 3 on STO(111) with no ε-Fe 2 O 3 were also studied. From the study of these films, a second outcome of the experiment was the discovery of satellites in the 00L reflections of the AlFeO 3 films which appear when this material becomes ferrimagnetic below its Curie Temperature at 250 K (see Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This result indicates that the structure is affected by the onset of magnetic order in these polar ferrimagnets This finding indicates what kind of structural changes can be expected to find in ε-Fe 2 O 3 opens the door to a detailed understanding of the coupling relationships between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom in magnetoelectric oxides.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: θ-2θ pattern around the (002) Bragg peak of a 62 nm thick AlFeO 3 film, above (300 K) and below (80 K) the paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition.</figDesc></figure>
