<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Report HS1219</head><p>Properties of magnetic materials are a subject of great scientific and practical interest.</p><p>An enormous amount of experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out to get a deeper understanding of the nature of ma gnetism in solids 1 . One of the most well known and still not fully understood phenomenon related to magnetism is the so-called Invar effect. In 1897 Guillaume 2 discovered the original Invar property of the face centered cubic (fcc) iron-nickel alloys conta ining about 35 at.% Ni, which exhibits an anomalously low (almost zero) and constant thermal expansion over a wide region around room temperature. Subsequently he found the temperatureindependent elastic behavior of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys that is now known as the "Elinvar" effect. We have measured the pressure -volume (P-V) relations for cubic iron-nickel alloys for three different compositions, Fe 0.64 Ni 0.36 , Fe 0.55 Ni 0.45 , and Fe 0.20 Ni 0.80 . It is observed that for a certain pressure range the bulk modulus does not change or even can decrease to some minimum value, after which it begins to increase under still higher pressure. In our experiment we observe for the first time a new effect, namely that the Fe-Ni alloys with high Ni concentrations, which show positive thermal expansion at ambient pressure, become Invar system upon compression over a certain pressure range (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The P -V-T relations for Fe0.92Ni0. <ref type="bibr">08,</ref><ref type="bibr">Fe0.85Ni0.15,</ref><ref type="bibr">Fe0.8Ni0.2,</ref><ref type="bibr">Fe0.75Ni0</ref>.25, Fe 0.64 Ni 0.36 , Fe 0.53 Ni 0.64 , and Fe 0.20 Ni 0.80 are measured up to 180 GPa and 1250 K. We also observed decomposition of Fe 0.80 Ni 0.20 alloy at pressures above 15 GPa on the mixture of Fe -reach ( hcp) and Ni-reach (fcc) phases. This two phases did not homogenize upon heating at 1200 K during 8 hours at pressure above 60 GPa. This result is very important for understanding the process of planets (particularly Earth) differentiation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1. Variation of relative volume of Fe 0.55 Ni 0.45 alloy at 0.41(3) GPa, 7.7(1) GPa, and 28.3(3) GPa. During the heating, pressure maintained constant within the experimental error. At 7.7(1) GPa and at temperatures between 291 K and 500 K, Fe 0.55 Ni 0.45 practically does not expand (? =0.2(3) 10 -5 K -1 ), while no anomalies in thermal expansion of this alloy were observed at 0.41(3) and 28.3(3) GPa. Error bars show uncertainties in temperature and volume.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,111.00,69.00,404.25,302.25" type="bitmap" /></figure>
