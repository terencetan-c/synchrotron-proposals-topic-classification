<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Endometriosis is an inflammatory disease affecting about 10% of women of reproductive age, which is still poorly understood and that causes considerable suffering for a large number of women. Endometriosis, in fact, is a chronic condition characterized by the presence of endometrium, tissue that typically lines the uterus, in extrauterine sites such as the ovaries, bowel or vagina, thus leading to an inflammatory reaction in the pelvis and abdomen. In the pathology there is the role of a specific component of the immune system, namely the complement system, a veritable cascade of enzymes that participates in the process of defense against pathogens.</p><p>A role of iron has been proposed and another aspect analyzed is that of disease development related to environmental factors. It is hypothesized that iron is involved in the genesis and progression of the disease, as this metal is released during cyclical bleeding and tends to accumulate in the tissues surrounding endometriotic lesions, especially at the level of the ovary, which could lead to an increased risk of infertility. We hipothize that iron accumulation is accompained by deposition of enviromental metals.</p><p>This beamtime aimed at investigating by XRF microscopy the appearance of environmental chemical elements, that possibly colocalize with the iron in the invading endometrium.</p></div>
