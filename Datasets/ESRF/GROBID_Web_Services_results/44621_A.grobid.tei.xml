<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The discovery of superconductivity at 11.5 K in CaC 6 , a graphite intercalation compound, has motivated a wealth of research into understanding the superconducting mechanism in this material. Another electronic ground state which manifests within this system is that of a charge density wave (CDW) as evidenced by recent STM and STS data. The co-existence of charge ordering and superconductivity within graphitic materials strengthens the already existing analogy with layered high-T c materials. In order to further characterise the CDW state in CaC 6 we intended to utilise single-crystal x-ray diffraction to observe the charge superlattice and compare its periodicity with that of STM data. Additionally we aimed to measure the temperature dependence of the CDW peaks and the CaC 6 lattice parameters.</p><p>CaC 6 samples were grown via a molten alloy method at University College London. The samples were characterised using in-house x-ray diffraction and transported to the ESRF in an argon atmosphere to inhibit oxidation. The samples were loaded onto copper stubs, specific for transmission geometry, i.e. plate-like single crystal samples were mounted vertically in order for the scattering vector to probe the in-plane charge structure. The stubs were then mounted onto the end of a displex, encapsulated by two Beryllium domes.</p><p>We attempted to measure the temperature dependent, in-plane scattering from CaC 6 , using the newly acquired MAR CCD camera. However, the FIT 2D software required to automatically calculate reciprocal space positions highlighted on the 2D images was not working as yet, so these had to be calculated a posteriori. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows a very recent result from the MAR CCD camera, the ( <ref type="formula">100</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>) peaks are highlighted in red and the ( <ref type="formula">100</ref>) is shown in the insert. The  <ref type="formula">100</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">200</ref>), respectively, from bottom to top. The peak highlighted in yellow has yet to be identified.</p><p>The insert shows this peak in more detail, accompanied by the (100).</p><p>peak that is highlighted in yellow is yet to be identified and lies at the (1.16 0 0) position. Two very weak satellites accompany this peak and lie either side of the [100] direction. This image was taken at 15 K, however the peak has been seen up to 300 K. The precise temperature dependence could not be achieved due to stability problems with the PIDs of the displex. However, these initial results and the fact they these unusual peaks are present at low T and at 300 K are of considerable interest, since extra peaks are expected from the charge structure seen using STM. Further experiments to more precisely determine the in-plane lattice parameters as a function of temperature and to measure up to 800 K in a cryofurnace would be of great benefit, as would a comparison with other GIC systems.</p><p>In summary, we have observed some unusual diffraction peaks in unexpected regions of reciprocal space, but need further measurement to probe the temperature dependence.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
