<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Date of report:</head><p>Shifts:</p><p>• 1. Structure-based drug design of EthR2 chemical modulators (main project): Recently, we have discovered that inhibition of the transcriptional repressor EthR2 leads to the awakening of a new ethionamide bio-activation pathway and to the reverting of the acquired and innate ethionamide-resistance. We are currently developing EthR2-inhibitory compounds to drive medicinal chemistry towards new EthR2 modulators for using in combination therapy against tuberculosis.</p><p>• 2. Structural investigation of the interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis MabA (FabG1) and a series of drug candidates: we have been trying to get crystal structures of MabA protein in complex with several new inhibitors. This protein represents a target of choice to a drug discovery program against tuberculosis.</p><p>• 3. Crystal structure of lipY, a putative drug target of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: solving the structure of M. tuberculosis lipY should pave the way for starting a structure-based drug design program.</p><p>• 4. Molecular mechanisms of the yeast Mep2 ammonium transport: optimal production conditions have been developed to obtain the Mep2 membrane protein in fully-active form.</p><p>We would like to solve the crystal structure of an active form, that should provide important insights into the transport mechanism.</p><p>• 1. EthR2: the two first runs (21-10-2016 and 14-12-2016) yielded few exploitable results. All the resolved EthR2 crystal structures showed only weak occupancy for ligands. Note that co-crystals were obtained by soaking. In the third run (05-03-2017) we tested several EthR2 crystals obtained by different soaking procedures using the same ligand, thereby allowing to determine the optimal condition of soaking. Data collected confirmed the effectiveness of our soaking procedure and after structure determination by molecular replacement and the initial refinement steps, we are sure to have at least 5 high-resolution EthR2 structures in complex with 5 different chemical modulators (resolution ranged from 1.81 to 2.10 Å). In parallel, we have developed a procedure to obtain by co-crystallization EthR2 in complex with SMARt-420, the first ligand studied and published. This structure was resolved at 2.00 Å. In summary, the 6 EthR2 complex structures resolved here will be presented and described in details in two future publications, with coordinates and structure factors deposited to the protein databank.</p><p>• 2. MabA: about 35 crystals were tested and 25 data were collected. More than 20 structures were solved with resolution ranging from 1.63 Å to 2.95 Å. However, no ligand, substrate or co-factor was present in obtained structures. Thus, despite all the efforts (co-crystallization, soaking, screening in presence of ligand, temperature, guanidinium chloride, etc), it seems evident therefore that MabA protein is reluctant to form crystals containing any ligand, such as substrate, co-factor or synthetic inhibitor.</p><p>• 3. lipY: 12 crystals were tested and 4 data were acquired. We failed to solve the structure by molecular replacement. We tried I-SAD (one data) and Hg-SAD (one data) phasing, but without any success, probably due to the fixed wavelength of ID30-A (12.8 keV).</p><p>• 4. Mep2: 39 different crystals were tried. Most of them gave no diffraction. Only one incomplete data on run of 05-03-2017 could be processed correctly, giving by molecular replacement a structure solved at 4.65 Å. Currently, we are fine screening the initial crystallographic condition to improve Mep2 crystal quality.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Lead optimisation and structure-guided design of a new chemical series of ethionamide booster for tuberculosis combination therapy Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): René Wintjens, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium Alexandre Wohlkönig, Vrij Universiteit Brussels, Belgium Alain Baulard, Pasteur Institute of Lille, France Report: In this first run, 50 crystals were tested and about 40 data were collected. Most crystals (29) were part of the main project (structure-guided design of ethionamide booster), while 21 crystals were of three side-projects (more details described below).</figDesc></figure>
