<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Thermal recovery of self-irradiation induced defects </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During in-pile, irradiation-induced damage occurs in nuclear fuel and results in a deterioration of its properties, which can affect the margin to melt of the fuel. Damage also occurs in fresh fuel through the selfirradiation process, and thus provides a convenient means to investigate changes in the material. A 10 uranium-plutonium mixed nitride fuel made over 25 years ago, and stored in the JRC archives has been retrieved and studied by XRD, EXAFS and TEM 1 .</p><p>XAS data acquisition was performed on the damaged U0.78Pu0.22N powder mixed with BN, the latter being essentially transparent to X-rays. XAS measurements were conducted at the ROBL 20 beamline dedicated to actinide elements at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, France).</p><p>The U L3 and Pu L3 edges XANES spectra of the damaged U0.78Pu0.22N NIMPHE fuel are presented in the Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. At the U L3 edge, one can observed that the shape and the energy position of the damaged U0.78Pu0.22N XANES spectrum are similar to the UN reference materials. Thus the oxidation state of U in mixed (U,Pu)N is the same as in pure UN. Note that the U valence is not influenced by the presence of Pu, as would have been expected. Comparing with the UO2 XANES spectra, one can observe a shift of 3.2 eV. At the Pu L3 edge, a shift of ~ 3 eV toward the lower energies was observed between the XANES spectrum of U0.78Pu0.22N and PuO2. As a similar shift was reported for PuN and PuO2, it can be supposed that Pu exhibit the same valence in PuN and (U,Pu)N materials.</p><p>In accordance with the XRD, both U LIII and Pu LII EXAFS spectra were fitted considering a NaCl type structure (Fm-3m). The experimental and fitted EXAFS spectra are presented in the Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. A good agreement between the experimental and fitted data is observed, confirming the validity of the structural model used for the analysis. No additional Me-N or Me-Me distances were needed to reproduce the experimental data, confirming the complete local integration of Pu in the rocksalt structure. Considering the experimental uncertainty, this shows that the anion and cation atoms are still located on the theoretical atomic positions of the NaCl structure, i.e. no atoms ejected in interstitial positions through the energy of the selfirradiation process could be detected. The EXAFS data analysis provides element-specific Me -N bond lengths. Indeed, the first U -N1 interatomic distance is equal to 2.440 (5) Å while the Pu -N1 is about 0.03 Å higher. Besides, the U -N1 distance is consistent with previous EXAFS measurement on UN. This bimodal distribution in the cation sublattice was expected, as different U-N1 and Zr-N1 bond lengths have been reported for analogous (U,Zr)N compounds. One should note that equal U-O1 and Pu-O1 interatomic distances have been observed in only U0.50Pu0.50O2. Indeed, a multimodal distribution, explained by the presence of cuboctahedral oxygen defects, was reported for mixed oxides with lower content of Am (&gt; 30%).</p><p>Coupling XRD, EXAFS and TEM has shown that this material was still well-crystallized 1 . However, an increase of 0.3 % of the lattice parameter was found. As shown by the EXAFS, the U-N and Pu-N as well as the metal -metal distances are similarly affected. However, no significant modification of both anion and cation sublattice was found.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): D.
