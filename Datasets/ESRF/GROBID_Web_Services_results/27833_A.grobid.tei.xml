<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KI-BEAM Thin-Walled Capillary Test Tubes</head><p>General Description KI-BEAM tubes are thin-walled capillary test tubes, intended as a cost-effective replacement for glass capillary test tubes, microvials and microreactors, whenever biocompatibility, unbreakability ease of handling, reopenability, safe sample recovery, X-ray transaparency and good optical transmission are desired. KI-BEAM tubes can be used for liquid and powder samples.</p><p>A tightly fitting PTFE disposable piston is integrated in every single tube. The pistontube unit can therefore be handled as a microsyringe or micropipette, thus allowing full sample manipulation (filling, recovery) without the aid of external pipette systems. KI-BEAM tubes have been tested for smallangle X-ray scattering measurements. Because of the extremely low wall thickness, tested at 1Å wavelength, the absolute scattering from the tube is extremely low, and the tube transparency to the beam is near 100%. The consistent geometry allows excellent intertube and intratube repeatibility of the scattering properties. Filled with water, the absolute scattering from the tube is significantly lower than the scattering from the water. Moreover, even at the highest fluencies available at the time this datasheet has been released (beamline ID2 at ESRF, Grenoble) no radiation damage is evident even after prolonged exposure to the beam.</p><p>The intrinsic optical translucency of the materials, combined with the low wall thickness, gives full optical access to the tube. All optical spectroscopies are therefore generally accessible. However, the inner and outer surfaces are not manufactured to optical requirements. For optical measurements that require low optical wavefront distortion. KI-BEAM tubes are generally not suitable.</p><p>The wide range of accessible measurement techniques allows sample transfer between different measurement instruments without the need for sample removal / recovery from the tube.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KI-BEAM</head><p>tubes are available in polycarbonate, ABS, PVDF and in an acrylonitrile-methyl acrylate impact-and biocompatibly-modified copolymer. They are normally available with round or square cross-section. They can be cut to length using a simple razor blade or scalpel. Custom shapes (flat, multi-lumen) can be manufactured to custom requirements. Other customizations can be made to modify optical and X-ray transmission, tube, piston and cap materials, and to functionalize the end caps with the addition of fittings or complex structures.</p><p>Two polyethylene conical caps are provided with each tube.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X-ray scattering @ 1 Å wavelength</head><p>The absolute scattering by the tube, measured @ 1 Å wavelength, is reported as (∂σ/∂Ω)/S, being normalized to the impinging beam cross-section S. All data is typical, and should not be considered as a guaranteed or certified specification, unless otherwise stated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommended operating conditions</head><p>As with all polymeric vials, operating conditions depend strongly on the sample, on the environment and on the applied stresses. The values are therefore intended as a guideline only, and specific tests are recommended before use.</p></div>
