<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We collected transmission in situ XAS data and high resolution powder X-ray diffraction on single site copper-gold silica aerogels during separated reaction stages of selective oxidation of propene.</p><p>The XAS data was collected in the quick-scan mode, and powder diffraction data was collected at the end point of individual treatments. The CuAu aerogel has previously been studied at SNBL for this reaction with promising results (CH-3593). The aerogels were compared to the hierarchical SAPO-34 (HSAPO-34) and the conventional microporous analogue, two carriers with different surface functionality and catalytic behavior. These three materials were found to be active and particularly selective for this reaction, however, they display entirely different catalytic behavior during H2 co-feed and H2 regeneration steps than the aerogel.</p><p>We conducted four studies with focus on formation of bimetallic Au-Cu clusters, possible sintering effects in C3H6 and O2 feed and regeneration steps with H2 or H2 as co-feed. The samples were reduced in H2 (5 %) to 350 °C using a ramp rate 5 °C/min, and was treated in C3H6 (1.1 %) and O2 (1.1 %) feed for speciation of selective oxidation of propene. Due to time limitations, we</p></div>

We planned to study particularly interesting samples in the upcoming beamtime in april (01-01-939) with longer scans to improve their data quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> show XANES at the Au l3 edge and Cu k-edge of the AuCu aerogel during C3H6/O2, H2 regeneration cycles and in C3H6/O2/H2. The aerogel and HSAPO-34 both formed CuAu bimetallic particles during reduction in H2, shown by the characteristic features in Au XANES upon reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(0). The feature remains in HSAPO-34 after switching to C3H6/O2 feed, and disappears when H2 was co-fed. EXAFS analysis confirms Cu…O + Cu/Au contribution in C3H6/O2, whereas prolonged Cu…Au distances are found in H2 co-feed. This structural change when adding H2 to C3H6/O2 is not visible in Cu XANES. Cycling between C3H6/O2 and H2-regeneration show reversibility in the aerogel, which is partly re-oxidised to Cu(I)/Cu(II) in C3H6/O2 and was completely re-reduced to the initial AuCu bimetallic particles in the H2-regeneration step. The AuCu synergy is not observed in Au XANES for the aerogel in neither C3H6/O2 feed, nor in H2 co-feed, however, EXAFS analysis shows Cu…O+Cu/Au interaction in reoxidised state. The data quality at the Au L3 edge was unsufficient and cannot confirm Au…Cu interaction for these samples.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">11920</formula><p>11940 11960 0 1 8980 8990 9000 9010 0 1 H 2 Normalised XANES Energy / eV Propox Cu k edge H 2 Energy / eV H 2 reg. cycle 1 Propox cycle 1 H 2 reg. cycle 2 Propox cycle 2 H 2 reg. cycle 3 Propox cycle 3 H 2 -propox Propox Au L3 edge Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Au L3 edge and Cu k-edge of AuCu silica aerogel during C3H6/O2 ("propox"), H2 regeneration ("H2 reg."), and in C3H6/O2 while co-feeding H2 ("H2-propox").</p></div>		</body>
