<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have explored recently the possibility to combine kaolinite with halloysite <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> or montmorillonite <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> in order to manufacture textured ceramics with enhanced mechanical properties. Our objective was to study the role of the clay particles shape and the sintering temperature on the structural evolution of phyllosilicate-based ceramic compounds (shaped by tape casting), using in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The experiments were performed under a heating rate of 20°C/min within a furnace (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) developed in the frame of the QMAX reasearch program (ANR-09-NANO-031-01), available at the BM02 beamline. The experiments were directed on two main scientific points:</p><p>(1) the dehydroxylation process of the clay minerals (kaolinite and halloysite) which occurs between 400°C and 800°C;</p><p>(2) the crystallization of mullite, between 900 and 1400°C (also isotherms at 1225°C for 8h).</p><p>-Results and the conclusions of the study (main part): -2D XRD maps were recorded at 17.9 keV very near to the zirconium absorption K-edge. Emphasis was led on two kaolins (KRG100 and KCS100) and a halloysite (H100). Typical 2D map obtained with the KRG100 and the H100 samples are presented on Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. As expected, the kaolin sample exhibited (00l) texture (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) with respect to the sample surface. As evidenced on the (002) pole figures reported on Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, due to the tubular-shape of its particles, the sample H100 showed a less prononced texture with respect to the same crystallographic axis (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>) In order to take into account the textural effect, the incidence angle of the primary X-ray beam onto the sample was fixed at temperature up to 800°C in agreement with the Bragg angle of the (00l) kaolinite (or halloysite when indicated) planes, and at higher temperature (above 800°C) with respect to the Bragg angle of the mullite (120) diffraction peak. All these patterns were collected and analyzed in order to give a deep insight to the evolution of the texture in clay-based tapes depending on the firing conditions (temperature and heating rate) and the influence of the initial texture of the clay minerals. The obtained results will be used to probe the structural organization of the clay minerals within the initial tapes and to follow in situ the topotactic crystallization of mullite crystals upon heating up to 1400 °C. Experiments will allow correlating the crystallization and growth of mullite crystals with both the initial texture of clay minerals and the substitution of kaolinite by halloysite. Fig. 2. 2D map recorded at room temperature (RT) a) b) Fig. 3. (002) pole figures of a) kaolin KRG100 and b) halloysite H100 at RT</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.a) illustrates the variation of the main (00l) peaks of the kaolinite phase during the dehydroxylation. Indeed, the vanishing of these peaks proceeds gradually from 450°C to 700°C. This trend is a new input regarding the study of the dehydroxylation process of kaolinite. The literature was considering that during this dehydroxylation, the XRD peaks of kaolinite disappeared abruptly at 550°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. The difference with halloysite was noted according to the final temperature of the amorphization of halloysite phase (close to 650°C, patterns are not shown here). Furthermore, the texture within the KRG100 sample was preserved upon the dehydroxylation as assessed through the plot of the evolution of the (002)K peak intensity in the temperature range 400°C -800°C as a function of the azimuthal angle  (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.b)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 4. (a) part of the 1D XRD patterns of the sample KRG100 with increasing dehydroxylation temperature; and (b) evidence of the texture of the kaolin sample KRG100 using the evolution of the peak intensity with respect to  (azimuthal angle) during the dehydroxylation</head><p>After the amorphization observed in the various samples, the presence of transitory spinel like phases seemed to occur in the range 1000°C -1150°C. Besides, the formation of mullite was detected at higher temperatures. The isothermal 1D patterns of KRG100 sample performed at 1225°C, are presented on Fig. mullite doublet ((120) and ( <ref type="formula">210</ref>)) appeared to vary significantly with time (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.b)). The latter behavior appears more pronounced for KRG100 than for H100, and is relevant with a timedependent stoichiometry or texture of mullite in the early age of the crystallization. These results are consistent with the expected relation between the initial kaolinite texture and the newly formed mullite crystallites as well as the amount of mullite. The detailed analyses of the XRD patterns during the crystallization of mullite within the samples will also bring some useful hints regarding the crystallization kinetics in halloysite and kaolin-based samples.</p></div>

We were able to characterize the crystallization of mullite in the range 1225°C to 1400°C through isothermal measurements. Moreover, this beamline allows to perform rapid heating rate for dynamic and isotermal experiments. -Publication(s): -We are planning to submit a contribution to the upcoming Euroclay2019, in addition, we are working with these results in order to propose a scientific paper during year 2019.</p><p>11,0 11,2 11,4 11,6 11,8 12,0 2 THETA (°) to 1h 2h 3h 4h 5h 7h 8h (120) mul (210) mul (101) q Increasing time 11.0 11.2 11.4 11.6 11.8 12.0</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .Fig. 3 .</head><label>13</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
