<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Sintering of loose or compacted granular bodies is an important final step in the production of components via the powder metallurgical route. Transport processes, motions such as translation and rotation of particles, have been shown to be important in contributing to the early stages of sintering. We have carried out a novel experiment in which individual particle displacements and rotations are inferred from mapping the shapes and crystallographic orientations of the individual crystallite grains contained within polycrystalline copper spheres, in three-dimensions and in situ during a sintering heat treatment. Conventional absorption contrast tomography was combined with diffraction contrast tomography (DCT); the former to monitor and track the lateral movements and shape changes of the particles, while exploiting DCT to map the grain shapes and orientations of the polycrystalline particles.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows two 3-D isosurface representations of the copper particles, from absorption contrast tomography scans, in their loose as-filled state within the 0.5 mm diameter capillary and after a sintering heat treatment. The magnified images for the two steps illustrate the development of interparticle bonds or necks between neighbouring particles, indicated by the corresponding numbers in the two images for those on the cut surface of the cropped section. The arrows indicate necks formed between particles further into the interior of the cropped section and so showing their outer surfaces. It is the characteristics of the particle motions associated with and contributing to these shape changes occurring during sintering that we are interested in identifying. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the information we are able to extract from the DCT data, with a spatial resolution of ~2 µm and grain orientation resolution of &lt; 0.1 °. Changes in grain orientation reveal the particle rotations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a)), while the ability to characterise grain boundaries both between and within the particles is enabled (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c)</ref>). In following the particle rotations over several steps during the early stages of a sintering heat treatment we are able to extract and plot statistical data such as the mean rotation speed of individual particles and the average of groups of particles, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. This infers the rotation speed to decrease, initially quite quickly and then getting more shallow, as sintering time progresses.</p><p>Further analysis of the data will focus on extracting specific characteristics for the driving forces for particle rearrangement, for example the mechanisms behind why some particles are more 'active' than others and the relationship to the number of contacting neighbours.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. 3-D isosurface representations of the Cu particles in the initial as-filled state within the capillary, and after a sintering heat treatment of 1270 seconds at 1040°C.
