<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domains represent the key sensory modules of blue-light photoreceptor proteins widely distributed in all kingdoms of life. Although LOV proteins possess a structurally conserved core domain, they differ significantly in the N-and Cterminal elements that largely determine the mode of dimerization. Limited information is currently available regarding any light-dependent quaternary structural changes, although a light-dependent alteration of the monomer-dimer equilibrium would represent a feasible mode of signal-relay for 'short' LOV proteins, where one of the two quaternary structural states selectively mediates the interaction with downstream signaling partners, triggering the cellular response. We previously determined the crystal structure of two such short LOV proteins, namely PpSB1-LOV of Pseudomonas putida and DsLOV of Dinoroseobacter shibae.</p><p>For DsLOV, our previous SAXS measurements verified the mode of dimerization as seen in the dark-state crystal structure. The objective of the experiment was to characterize the overall quaternary structure, monomer:dimer equilibrium and the low-resolution shape of both the dark-and the light-state of several LOV proteins in solution. In this proposal, we aimed to measure selected LOV proteins in dark and light adapted states using the SAXS technique. These proteins exhibit dark recovery time in the range from seconds (fast reverting) to days (slow reverting). The photochemical properties of the proteins selected for these studies have been determined in our group: PpSB1-LOV (lifetime of the photo-adduct τREC ≈ 2500 min, 20 °C), PpSB1-LOV-R61H/R66I (τREC = 9 min), DsLOV-M49I (τREC = 2.6 min), YF1 (τREC = 93 min) and SB1F1 (τREC = 923 min).</p><p>In the following we present the key results obtained from the experiment on BM29:</p><p>In general the static dark and light SAXS experiments worked well and gave valuable information about the possible signal transfer mechanism of PpSB1.</p><p>We were able to record time-resolved SAXS data with a delay time of several minutes from the light illuminated state through the recovery process to the fully dark adapted state. However, the kinetic SAXS experiments did not show any significant and statistically relevant differences in the recorded diffractograms. We attribute that result to the not perfect illumination of the sample and the fact that the light state could not be excited for the kinetic experiments. In a following SAXS experiment on BM29 we would like to repeat the time-resolved SAXS experiments, which would give valuable information who the light-state returns structurally to the dark-state.

In the crystal structure a decent number of C-and N-terminal amino acid residues are missing as no electron density was observed. These amino acids still contribute to the solution scattering data and therefor dummy atoms were modeled C-and N-terminally to the crystal structure using the program CORAL (Petoukhov , et al., 2012).

A difference in the measured SAXS data between 0.1 and 0.2 Å -1 is visible with the eye. On the bottom the data are plotted as Kratky plots. The solid green and blue lines are calculated curves of models determined with the CORAL program. The observed differences mainly stem from ordered and disordered end regions at the top of the long Jα helices.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,70.85,71.17,453.30,464.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
