<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>After installation of the required equipment and bakeout of the ID32 UHV chamber we had to find that the ID32 electron analyser failed to work. Since this is obviously a vital part of the experiment, no data could be taken and the experiment had to be cancelled by the local contact (B C C Cowie). The technical problems of the detector were later analysed in detail by B C C Cowie, who filed an internal report regarding that matter. The reader is referred to B C C Cowie and his report for details of this problem and its solution, which is beyond the control of the users.</p><p>In the meantime, the problem has been solved, and the experiment has been rescheduled for July 2002.</p></div>			</div>
