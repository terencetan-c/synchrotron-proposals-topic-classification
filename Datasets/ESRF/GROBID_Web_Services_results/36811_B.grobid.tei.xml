<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Chen et al. (Nature 420 (2002)  302) reported in 2002 that a mixture of lithium amide and lithium hydride could store up to 6.5wt% of hydrogen. Unfortunately the working temperature (&gt;250°C) is impractically high for hydrogen storage applications. However Luo et al. (J.  Alloys Compd. 381 (2004)  284) have shown that a mixture of LiNH 2 and MgH 2 requires a lower working temperature and suggested the formation of Li 2 Mg(NH) 2 . Several related nonstoichiometric phases, 7 Li 2+x MgN 2 D 2-x , with x = -1, 0, 0.66 and 1, were synthesised with the direct reaction.</p><p>The isotope 7 Li was used to reduce neutron absorption in the sample.</p><p>The thermal decomposition of 7 Li 2+x MgN 2 D 2-x with x=0 and 0.66 were investigated by the insitu SR-PXD. Simultaneous Raman spectroscopy was been performed during the desorption process. The materials were inserted in a sapphire capillary and place in dynamical primary vacuum. The sample was heated with a ramping rate of 2C°/min and diffraction patterns where collected every 2 minutes.</p><p>Under dynamical vacuum the samples exhibits a characteristic transition temperature of about 260°C both observed in the diffraction patterns and Raman shift. Preliminary high resolution SR-PXD data suggest that the unit cell parameter for x = 0.66 is bigger than the one previously reported. PND data were recorded at PUS for the four different compositions.</p><p>The analysis of the collected SR-PXD and PND data are still in progress.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LiAl(NH 2 ) 4</head><p>The amides LiAl(NH 2 ) x and NaAl(NH 2 ) y were synthesized by a mechanochemical reaction between liquid ammonia (NH 3 ) and the alanates LiAlH 4 and NaAlH 4 , respectively. The milling conditions were optimized to achieve the highest possible amide content (x and y). It is clear that y was 4, which is the highest known amide content in this group of materials. x was somewhat lower, probably close to 2. The materials were characterized by a combination in-situ synchrotron SR-PXD and Raman scattering.</p><p>The material was inserted in a sapphire capillary and place under dynamical primary vacuum. The sample was heated with a ramping rate of 2C°/min and diffraction patterns where collected every 2 minutes over a range of 40° in theta. The temperature evolution of NaAl(NH 2 ) 4 is illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The sample exhibits two characteristics transitions at 110°C and 238°C; observed both in the diffraction patterns and Raman shift (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Up to 110°C NaAl(NH 2 ) 4 remain crystalline and its structure is described in P2 1 /c space group (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The transition temperatures are in agreement with TDS measurements. They correspond to the two consecutive discharges of 0.5 NH 2 and 1.5 NH 2 mole per formula units in NaAl(NH 2 ) 4 . Above 110°C the sample present short-range ordering characterized by broad diffuse scattering around 4.2 and 1.2 Å. Raman data indicated that [Al(NH 2 ) 4 ] -remain up to the second transition at 238 o C and are not anymore observed at 300°C (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p><p>The analysis of the collected data are still in progress.

Mg(BH 4 ) 2 Mg(BH 4 ) 2 was produced by cryomilling LiBH 4 and MgCl 2 . Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TPD) carried out on the product with 5 o C/min shows 5 stages of desorption. The sample was studied at SNBL (MAR) with the same heating rate. In the beginning of the reaction we can see the diffraction peaks of low temperature phase of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 (second simulated phase in the Fig. 6 (top)) and Li 2 MgCl 4 . Upon heating the diffraction peaks of LT phase disappear at about 170°C. At about 100°C a phase transition for the LT Mg(BH 4 ) 2 phase is observed before the desorption started. This phase transition was not detected before with TDP. In the later stage of the desorption reaction at 180°C some of the peaks of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 disappear and transformation to amorphous state is clearly observed. Raman spectroscopy was carried our in order to understand those structural changes during desorption. Data analysis is still in progress. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ca(BH 4 ) 2 and decomposition product phases</head><p>Ca(BH 4 ) 2 is considered as an attractive hydrogen storage material due to high gravimetric capacity and expected thermodynamic properties suitable for mobile hydrogen storage applications. However, the decomposition route is still unclear.</p><p>A challenge in the investigation of the decomposition route for this material is the formation of X-ray amorphous decomposition product phases and high sensitivity to experimental conditions. In this investigation, the thermal decomposition of α-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 preheated to 350˚C was studied using quartz capillary and a heating rate of 2 o C/min. Bragg peaks from the socalled "δ"-phase mentioned in previous reports are observed, as are peaks from the unknown phase observed in the measurement using glass capillary and γ/β-Ca(BH 4 ) 2 as starting material. This unknown phase was however not observed in our previous measurement (december 2007) using quartz capillaries.</p><p>By combining the results from the 3 different experiments at BM01 on this material, good information on possible elemental composition for the different observed unknown phases can hopefully be obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ca(BH 4 ) 2 from ball milling</head><p>An unknown modification of Ca(BH 4 ) 2 was produced by cryomilling LiBH 4 and CaCl 2 and thermal decomposition was studied at MAR. LiCl was formed as a side product, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> shows MAR data for starting material of ball milled and cryomilled powder. The peaks for the cryomilled material are more broad then the peaks for ball milled material. 2D plot of cryomilled unknown phase of Ca(BH 4 ) 2 shows clearly the phase transition, which was detected before with TPD at about 250°C. It also interacts with LiCl at certain stage of the decomposition reaction. Raman measurements were also performed on that sample. Data analysis is in progress. Hydride formation in Mg-based ternary systems Hydride formation in mechanically activated (i.e. ball-milled) Mg-based ternary systems (Mg-Ti-Ni, Mg-Ti-Al, Mg-Ti-Fe, and Mg-Fe-Co) was investigated. (Mg 0.8 Ti 0.2 ) 2 Ni and (Mg 0.8 Ti 0.2 ) 2 Fe powders ball-milled in Ar were analysed at BM01B in May 2008. Such powders are precursors that will be hydrogenated in a conventional Sievert apparatus. In April 2008 Mg 2 (Fe 0.5 Co 0.5 ) powders which were ball milled in a H 2 (D 2 ) atmosphere at 50 bar were analysed at BM01A. Reactive milling results in the formation of a novel cubic quaternary hydride, which upon heating (2 o C/min) in vacuum decomposes at about 320 °C (Fig. 8). Neutron diffraction analysis is currently carried out at IFE to confirm the structure of the Mg-Fe-Co hydride. The above results will be presented at international conferences this coming summer. 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 temperature [°C] 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 temperature [°C] LiCl + 10vol% MgH 2 and LiCl + 5vol% MgH 2 Highly dispersed MgH 2 in a LiCl matrix was synthesised by ball milling LiH and MgCl 2 . Laboratory PXD was used to investigate the phase content of the mixture, but the signal from MgH 2 was too weak to be distinguished from the background and the strong peaks from the LiCl matrix. With the data from the SR-PXD measurements it was possible to see different Mg-compounds together with Fe contaminant from the milling balls. The samples were heated from 40 °C to 350 °C with a constant rate of 4 o C/min. Decomposition of MgH 2 happened from 280 °C. Unwanted formation of MgO started at around 140 °C.
