<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Photosynthetic water oxidation by photosystem II (PSII) is the source of atmospheric dioxygen and thus of fundamental biological importance. Water oxidation takes place at the tetra-manganese complex of PSII. This complex additionally contains one calcium ion which is essential for the functioning of water oxidation. The location of the Ca ion relative to the four Mn atoms and its coordination environment were here investigated by XAS at the Ca K-edge, a particularly challenging BioXAS experiment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Partially dehydrated multilayer samples for XAS (~200) of highly active PSII membranes were prepared on Ca-free Mylar tape. Depletion of bulk Ca was achieved by a Chelex-100 treatment. Chelex-treated samples contained 2 ±1.5 Ca atoms per 4 Mn atoms as determined by AAS. XAS at the Ca K-edge was performed at 50 K using a newly constructed evacuated cryostat where 4 samples were mounted simultaneously on a helium-cooled turnable coldfinger. XAS spectra were collected at 45° in fluorescence mode using a largearea photodiode placed within the cryostat as a detector. A Ca-free, 150 nm thick Si-nitrite window facilitated I 0 detection; no other foils were passed by the incident X-ray beam (spot size ~1 mm 2 ) or the Xray fluorescence prior to detection. XAS spectra were measured in the rapid-scan mode of ID26 within 30 s (scan range 3900-4500 eV). The energy axis was calibrated by use of reference substances.</p><p>The following results were obtained:</p><p>(1) Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> compares XANES spectra of a PSII sample which contained bulk calcium with a sample where the Ca content was reduced to ~2 Ca / 4 Mn (Chelex-treated). Reproducible differences in the XANES spectra of ~2 Ca / 4 Mn containing samples (higher pre-edge peak, by 0.3 eV reduced edge energy, lower principal maximum) are likely indicative of a lower coordination number and/or symmetry of Ca bound to PSII compared to its more symmetric coordination by 7-8 water molecules in the bulk.</p><p>(2) The difference in the Ca K-edge magnitudes (see arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) was employed to address radiation damage. At an excitation energy of 4038 eV the X-ray fluorescence was recorded as function of time with Chelex-treated samples. The increase of the fluorescence intensity within ~400 s (at 50 K, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) likely indicates the release of specifically bound Ca from its binding site into the bulk due to radiation damage. Within the duration of the XAS scans (30 s), however, the Ca K-edge magnitude remained unchanged (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, arrow) meaning that Ca stayed bound to the Mn complex; radiation damage was therefore negligible.</p><p>(3) Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the Fourier-transforms (FTs) of EXAFS oscillations (inset) of the ~80 Ca / 4 Mn and the Chelex-treated samples. The spectrum of the high-Ca sample is well simulated using a single Ca-O shell (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, fit I) and with parameters which are anticipated for fully hydrated bulk Ca.</p><p>In the FT of the EXAFS oscillations of the Chelex-treated sample a pronounced second peak at ~2.7 Å of reduced distance emerges (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, arrow) which is attributed to Ca-Mn interactions. A good simulation of this spectrum was obtained using two Ca-O vectors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, fit II) and one Ca-Mn shell. Further quantitative considerations reveal that the Ca bound to the Mn complex is coordinated by 5-6 oxygens and that it is at ~3.3 Å distance from at least two Mn atoms. The new information from Ca XAS in combination with our previous Mn XAS results yields a tentative model for the location of the Ca in the Mn complex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>(4) Ca XAS spectra were also measured with the Mn complex in one higher oxidation state obtained by illumination of samples in the cryostat at 200 K and with biochemically treated samples. The analysis of the obtained spectra (not shown) is underway and expected to yield, i.a., information on changes in the Ca-Mn distances upon the oxidation of Mn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary:</head><p>The measurements on PSII protein preparations revealed that Ca XAS is feasible on biological samples at ID26. Radiation damage can be avoided using the rapid-scan mode of ID126 and well-adapted measuring protocols. For the first time, XANES and EXAFS spectra of Ca bound to the Mn complex of photosynthesis were obtained in two oxidation states of the water oxidation reaction cycle. The current preliminary status of data analysis already reveals new and valuable information on the coordination of Ca in the Mn complex and of its distance, ~3.3 Å, from the Mn atoms. In further experiments, the experimental conditions should be modified with respect to the suppression of scattered X-rays to improve the quality of EXAFS spectra and to extent the useful energy range at the Ca Kedge.</p><p>The experiments carried out during run SC1228 lead to the following publication: Claudia Müller, Peter Liebisch, Marcos <ref type="bibr">Barra, Holger Dau, and Michael Haumann (2003)</ref> The location of calcium in the manganese complex of oxygenic photosynthesis studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Ca K-edge.
