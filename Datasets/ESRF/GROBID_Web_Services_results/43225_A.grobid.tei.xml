<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Observations and results: The failure rate of our experiments was exceptionally high, with only one successful run out of 15. There were many instances of blow-outs during heating, due to the abrupt flowing of gasket material. This very high blow-out rate was completely unexpected as we successfully used the exact same assembly at identical P-T conditions at ESRF for previous density measurements on the same samples <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>. Apart from a new supplier of boron epoxy gaskets we cannot think of a reason for this, and our number of experiments is too small to come to definitive conclusions.</p><p>In some instances, during heating radiography showed that the edges of the WC sphere started to get blurry due to reaction with the silicate melt. In one case the WC sphere was found to dissolve completely in the high-Ti black glass composition. Clearly WC is more reactive with these lunar magmas than expected. Future experiments will use molybdenum spheres. Previous ex situ experiments have shown that these show minimal interaction with lunar magmas during high P-T experiments <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Despite these experimental issues, one experiment was successful in recording a falling WC sphere through molten low-Ti 'green glass' in the absence of reactions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). In this particular experiment, Apollo green glass was subjected to a hydraulic pressure of 150 bar (sample pressure ~ 1.3 GPa). The sphere started to sink when the input power was 375 w during final heating at 25 w / min. Time-lapsed images of this experiment were analysed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The falling sphere method is based on Stoke's law which relates viscosity to the terminal velocity of the sinking sphere by the relation</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">μ = F m s C r a ν ρ ρ 2 .</formula><p>). ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>2 -, where μ is the viscosity (Pa s), ρ S -ρ M the density difference between the sinking sphere and the melt (kg/m 3 ) -a term which is very well constrained in this case because of our previous in situ measurements of ρ M , a is the gravitational constant, r the sphere radius (m), and v the sinking sphere velocity. C F is the Faxen correction term which accounts for interaction between the sphere and the wall of the capsule.</p><p>The time versus falling distance profile constructed from the position of the sphere, tracked on each individual frame is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The terminal velocity determined from leastsquare regression of the linear part ofthe plot equals 18.896 μs -1 .</p><p>The resulting viscosity coefficient obtained for the low-Ti Apollo 15C 'green glass' composition on the basis of the one successful experiment is ~ 48 Pa s. This value is orders of magnitude higher than the value of 0.64 Pa s previously reported by <ref type="bibr">Maeda et al. [6]</ref> for a similar composition at similar conditions. The predicted viscosity calculated using the model of <ref type="bibr">Giordano et al. [7]</ref> is also much lower, 0.34 Pa s at 1300 o C. Additional data, in particular electron microscope images of the run product, are required to rationalise this result. X-ray diffraction patterns of this experiment after the sphere had fallen suggest crystals were still present in the sample, but their proportion and sizes are not known. A sphere falling through a 'crystal mush' would obviously lead to higher than viscosities than expected from a fully molten liquid. Summary and outlook: Despite unexpected experimental setbacks we have shown that in situ falling-sphere viscometry on silicate liquids is in principle feasible at ESRF. Future experiments should use Mo as a sphere to prevent sample contamination, full post-experiment characterisation is required to correctly interpret results, and the behaviour of the 'new' gaskets should be tested in comparison with the 'old' gaskets that were produced in-house.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Typical cell assembly used for in situ viscosity measurements [1,2,3]. 1) Sample 2) WC sphere 3) Diamond capsule 4) Boron nitride 5) Graphite furnace and 6) Boron epoxy gasket</figDesc><graphic coords="1,48.61,626.96,184.00,133.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>
