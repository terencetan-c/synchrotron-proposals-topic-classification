<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The ion beam synthesis of nanoparticles in amorphous matrix has received great attention in the last years as a promising technique for nanocrystal formation in insulating layers. Metallic and semiconducting nanoclusters embedded in SiO 2 have been recognized as potential materials for the production of memory devices and optoelectronic components. However, a better understanding of formation and properties of nanocrystals is required for their technological applications.</p><p>The aim of the proposed experiment was to study the formation mechanism of Sb nanoclusters in thin SiO 2 films by ion implantation followed by different annealing treatments. In particular, the local atomic environment of Sb ions in SiO 2 under different annealing conditions was investigated by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) with synchrotron radiation <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</p><p>Due to the low concentration of implanted atoms (5 ´ 10 15 atoms/cm 2 ), and to the limited thickness of this system, we used K-edge fluorescence XAS in the grazing incidence geometry (Refl-EXAFS). The Refl-EXAFS technique, useful in the study of thin films, permits to minimize the scattering signal (Bragg peaks, Compton scattering...) from the substrate by limiting the penetration of the beam to a few nm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details and results</head><p>22 nm thick SiO 2 films were thermally grown on (001) silicon substrates and were implanted at room temperature with 10 keV/5x10 15 cm -2 Sb ions. Post-implantation thermal treatments were performed at 1000-1100 °C for 30 s by rapid thermal processing (RTP) in N 2 atmosphere. The films were also annealed at 900 °C for 600 s in a standard furnace either in N 2 and Ar+7%H 2 ambient.</p><p>Sb absorption coefficients were monitored in the fluorescence mode at the K-absorption edge in the grazing incidence geometry by using a thirteen-element Ge detector. The monochromator was equipped with a pair of Si(511) crystals running in dynamical sagittal focusing mode. The beam on the sample was sized to 40 µm by a pair of slits placed at a distance of 2 m. The incidence angle on the sample was chosen to be at the critical value for total reflection (1 mrad at 30500 eV) on SiO 2 . Reference compounds, i.e. powder of Sb, Sb 2 O 3 , Sb 2 O 5 , were measured in the transmission mode.</p><p>The near edge (XANES) and the extended region (EXAFS) of the absorption coefficient were analyzed for all samples and reference compounds. Raw absorption data were background-subtracted using the AUTOBK routine and EXAFS data were quantitatively analyzed with FEFFIT programs using theoretical phase signals generated by FEFF 8.0 Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(a) shows the XANES spectra of Sb implanted SiO 2 films and of the reference compounds Sb 2 O 3 , Sb 2 O 5 and metallic Sb. The zero of energy scale is set to the absorption edge of metallic Sb. The position of absorption edges of the samples is intermediate between that of Sb and Sb 2 O 3 , and always about 4 eV lower than Sb 2 O 5 The XANES line shape of Sb implanted samples is similar to that of the oxides, except for the sample annealed in Ar+7%H 2 which bears a closer resemblance to metallic Sb.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b) shows the magnitude of the Fourier Transform of the EXAFS data (k 2 weighted, k: 2.5-10 Å -1 ) for the Sb as-implanted and annealed samples in different conditions, and for metallic Sb . The dashed lines represent the fit of the data performed in the range R: 0.7-3.2 Å. The spectrum of the as-implanted sample was fitted with a combination of Sb-O and Sb-Sb signals. The thermal treatments lead to either an increase of metallic correlation indicating the formation of metallic Sb nanoclusters or to an oxidation of all the atoms in the matrix, depending on annealing temperature or atmosphere. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In summary, XAS analyses provided otherwise unavailable information on the local environment of Sb atoms implanted in thin SiO 2 films both after ion implantation and after different thermal treatments. Sb atoms are mainly coordinated with oxygen after ion implantation even if Sb-Sb correlations are present. Annealing at higher temperature (1100 °C) in a N 2 atmosphere or at lower temperature (900 °C) in a reducing atmosphere Ar + 7%H 2 leads to the formation of metallic Sb clusters, as confirmed by HREM.</p><p>[1] S.
