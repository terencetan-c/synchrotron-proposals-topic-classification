<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Structural effects on reactivity and deactivation of Pd ( <ref type="formula">111</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Aim:</p><p>The final aim of this experiment was the determination of the structural changes of palladium during electrochemical stimulus in the half cell of a direct alcaline ethanol fuel cell. It is in fact well known that palladium incurs into deactivation processes during alkaline fuel cells duty cycles. Previous experiments (MA-3173, as an example) performed on BM-08 enabled us to live follow changes into the speciation of palladium during duty cycles, but no previous study on structural modifications on these catalytical surfaces was previously been performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment frame:</head><p>The experiment was conducted by depositing various thicknesses of Palladium on an Au (111) monocrystal working electrode, using the beamline electrochemical flow cell. This flow cell avoids the contamination of the studied surface, and can be mounted directly in the EXP hutch sample holder, enabling operando SXRD experiments. For each deposited Pd film, a series of maps, l-scans, crystal Truncation Rods profiles and XRR scans were acquired, in order to detect changes along characteristic directions. Sample characterization was performed in three steps for each Pd deposit: 1) Prior to the Pd deposition (bare surface characterization) 2) After Pd deposition (pristine palladium surface) 3) After voltammetric stress cycles in NaOH + EtOH</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Set-up:</head><p>The experiment was performed in the hutch EH1 of the ID03 beamline, using the six circle diffractometer equipped with the ID03 electrochemical flow cell setup, already used in previous experiments MA-2082, MA-2251, MA-2636 and MA-3071. The experimental set up included the Maxipix detector mounted on the diffractometer arm and a Pilatus 300k-w detector used for fast acquisition of in-plane powder diffraction pattern (covering a 2Î¸ range between 10 and 20 with one single images at the energy of 24 KeV) and the XIA detector (for XRF) from the instrument pool.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples:</head><p>The first sample, constituted by a monolayer of Pd on Au (111) surface, was prepared using the underpotential deposition (UPD) of copper on gold, and Cu substitution by Surface Limited Redox Replacement (SLRR), as visible in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. The other palladium thicknesses were obtained by timed potentiostatic deposition from a Pd solution Results: XRR data analisys showed a Pd film roughness comparable to its thickness. On the other hand, we were able do notice, as a conseguence of the oxidative stress cycles, an enlargement of the Pd peaks, together with a shift of their position toward the gold ones. We were also able to detect an increase of the surface electrochemical activity (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) after the oxidative cycles. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>) and Pd monolayer deposited on Au (111) toward the electrochemical oxidation of alcohols (CNR-ICCOM, Italian National Research Council, Institute for the chemistry of OrganoMetallic Compounds)</figDesc></figure>
