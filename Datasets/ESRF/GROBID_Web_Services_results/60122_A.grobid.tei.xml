<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Part of the monocrystalline samples were prepared before experiment, but other and powders were prepared in the sample preparation room of BM01 beamline. Beam with energy of 17 keV was used. We successfully achieve temperatures below phase transitions (T N ≈ 46 K for Ni 3 (BO 3 ) 2 and T N &lt; 46 K Co 2 Ni(BO 3 ) 2 ) for our samples with the use of helium blower cryostate. It should be noted, that temperature was independently measured by the luminescence (≈14440 cm -1 lines) of the ruby crystals. Very weak superstructure reflexes were observed and currently analyzing. High quality and stability of the beam and assistance of the beamline staff and our local contact allowed us to measure additional samples: single crystals and powders of fluorides, namely KCoF 3 , RbCoF 3 and KNiF 3 . These crystals have perovskite cubic structure at room temperature and some of them undergoes coupled magneticstructural phase transitions. Nevertheless there are no complete understanding of mechanisms of this complex transitions as well as high resolution single-crystal diffraction data for this ftorides. As it was expected we found very weak splitting of the reflexes of the single-crystal samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Preliminary hypothesis is the second-order phase transition (independently confirmed by heat capacity measurements) to tetragonal phase.</p><p>In the last days a few orthorombic Pb containing borates were studied too, namely PbFeBO 4 and PbMnBO 4 . The structure of these crystals contain lone-pair Pb ions, rigid BO 3 groups and edge-shared chains of the magnetic ions. Early results shows that PbFeBO 4 have anomalous anisotropic thermal expansion due to the presence of the mentioned structural peculiarities, so, we can expect similar effect in PbMnBO 4 . Obtained data is currently being processed. Results of the measurements will be used for the preparation of manuscripts.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Splitting of the reflexes below Neel temperatures for KCoF 3 (T N = 114 K) and RbCoF 3 (T N = 101 K)</figDesc><graphic coords="2,92.59,56.83,244.76,307.08" type="bitmap" /></figure>
