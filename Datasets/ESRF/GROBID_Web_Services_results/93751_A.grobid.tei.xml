<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This experiment had one main objective with two subcomponents:</p><p>1. Develop a tandem X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRF) methodology for measuring Li-ion batteries (LIB) operando. a. Deliver proof of concept measurements on LiFePO4 positive electrodes b. Deliver proof of concept measurements on graphite negative electrodes c. Deliver proof of concept measurements on solid polymer electrolytes</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1a) Proof-of-concept XRF and XRD on positive electrodes</head><p>The first element was the tandem collection of XRF spectra and XRD diffractorgrams on LIBs operando. In order to obtain proof-of-concept on the feasibility of this system, we assembled a LiFePO4 (LFP)/Li-metal half-cell using a 1M LiAsF6 in EC:DMC in an X-ray transparent home made Swagelok cell. The cell was mounted on a translational stage and connected to a potentiostat for operando measurement (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> Simultaneous XRF/XRD setup for Swagelok LFP/Li cell</p><p>The incident beam was aligned with the knife-edge current collector (stainless steel) by using the Cr Kα to ensure the sample had no tilt. Once aligned, the cell was charged and discharge while linescans were performed.</p><p>Here the As Kα gives the concentration gradient of AsF6 -(and therefore of Li + ) in solution and the LFP characteristic peaks are monitored in XRD (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). These markers were monitored over the course of a (dis)charge at various currents. Although the data has not been completely processed yet, preliminary results confirm that we were able to observe the formation of a concentration gradient in the solution phase and monitor state-of-charge (SoC) in the solid phase. These data are critical for modeling LIBs accurately as well as for the development of new LIB electrode architectures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1b) Full cell measurements</head><p>Once proof-of-concept for the method was established, the next goal was to mount and measure a full cell (including both an intercalation cathode and anode simultaneously). To this end, we mounted a pre-assembled LFP/Graphite cell in a modified Swagelok cell. Although data was sucessfully collected, we observed a conflicting Cu Kα and Graphite characteristic XRD peak (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Our interpretation of this is that the Cu foil (the substrate on which the graphite electrode is placed) was bent, wavy or pinched in the cell. Measurement on a backup full cell yielded the same result. Given the LFP film was made freestanding (without underlying substrate) this problem did not arise for the cathode. For this reason, it was decided to extend the remaining beam time to performing measurements on the half-cell from Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. This problem will easily be avoided in the future by making the graphite film free-standing as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1c) Solid polymer electrolytes (SPE)</head><p>The final objective was to perform measurements on SPEs containing the LiAsF6 electrolyte which is used as a fluorescent probe. Although functional SPEs incorporating the LiAsF6 probe were developed sucessfully, ID-31 did not have heating/cooling capabilities for the dimensions of our cell (2 cm diameter, 15 cm height).</p><p>The developed SPEs only operated above 50°C and this component of the proposal is therefore delayed until 1) room temperature SPEs with the LiAsF6 salt can be produced or 2) a cell heating system developed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>In summary, the main objective of delivering proof of concept measurements involving simultaneous XRD and XRF measurements was accomplished. The subcomponent 1b) was partially accomplished through linescans performed at open circuit voltage. In order to gain quantitative information on the full-cell configuration (and specifically LIB anodes), freestanding graphite films can be made for a future beamtime.</p><p>The SPE component will be reworked (as outlined in 1b) to accommodate the infrastructure avaiable at ID-31.</p><p>The momentum of the progress made will be leveraged in a future proposal for beamtime. By applying the developed methodology to commercial LIB electrodes, valuable quantitative data will be acquired and made available for 1) improvement of numerical models and 2) industrial research and development of new LIB architectures. </p></div>			</div>
