<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>By using X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) at the ID10 beamline, ESRF, we have measured the atomic dynamics in La-Al-M (M=Ni and Cu) metallic glasses (MGs) under different temperatures in the glassy state (T g = 395 K for LaAlCu and 429 K for LaAlNi MG). The data were collected for a unique wave vector q 0 corresponding to the position of the first sharp diffraction peak in the static structure factor, where q 0 is of about 2.11-2.12 Å -1 for these MGs. In this way we have been able to look directly at the atomic dynamics in metallic glasses, which is still difficult to access by using any other techniques.</p><p>The data have been collected in a wide angle configuration by two two-dimensional detectors placed vertically symmetric with respect to the incoming beam. Two detectors recorded simultaneously the signal scattered at the same wave vector, therefore leading to a better statistics and fast measurements. Sets up to ~1300 images have been collected with an exposure time of 3 s per image, depending on the investigated temperature.</p><p>A picture of the dynamics can be entirely captured by XPCS through the determination of the two-time correlation function G(t1, t2) (TTCF) which represents the instantaneous correlation of the intensity I at two times t 1 and t 2 , being:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">1 2 1 2 1 2 ( ) ( ) ( , ) ( ) ( ) p p p</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I t I t G t t I t I t =</head><p>Here the average is done over all the pixels of the entire CCD. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (left) shows a TTCF measured in the glassy state for T = 333 K. This quantity represents the instantaneous correlation between two times. The main diagonal from the left bottom corner to the up right corner indicates the experimental time, while the intensity perpendicular to the main diagonal is proportional to the structural relaxation time. The line width along the main diagonal remains constant with time and it is relatively thin. This means that the atomic dynamics in the glassy state is governed by a fast, stationary, structural relaxation when the temperature is far below the T g with a characteristic time of few hundreds of seconds.</p></div>

(Right) Temperature dependence of correlation functions measured at q 0 = 2.11 Å -1 for the ascast LaAlNi MG.

Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>(right) shows the temperature dependence of the correlation functions in the as cast LaAlNi MG on heating from the glassy state. Upon increasing the temperature the dynamics shifts towards faster time scales due to the thermal motion but at 363 K where an anomalous slowing down of the dynamics is observed.</p><p>Additional measurements were performed in both La-Al-M (M=Ni and Cu) MGs following different thermal protocols on both as cast and fully pre-annealed samples and the analysis is ongoing. Combining the XPCS data with DSC, DMA and also in situ XRD and XAFS results, we hope to clarify the detailed structural and dynamical changes occurring in both MGs with temperatures.</p></div>		</body>
