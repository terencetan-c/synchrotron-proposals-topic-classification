<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We analyzed the distribution, mineralogy and speciation of Mn in marine polymetallic nodules recovered in the Pacific Ocean. Samples were prepared as thin sections and analyzed at beamline ID21 by µ-XRF and µ-XANES at the Mn K-edge to link microstructure and chemical speciation to sediment biogeochemistry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice of samples and standards:</head><p>Samples for this study were recovered in the Clarion-Clipperton fracture zone within the so-called "Pacific manganese nodule belt" in the north-east equatorial Pacific Ocean. Three nodules and one crust were analyzed. Measurements in the nodules focused on the surface (in contact with seawater), the bottom side (in contact with sediment) and the rim (in contact with the sediment-water interface). As a comparison, a nodule collected in the Peru Basin was also analyzed. Rhodocrosite (MnCO 3 ), Mn-diaspore (MnOOH) and pyrolusite (MnO 2 ) were selected as references for Mn 2+ , Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ , respectively. Other references, typical of manganese nodules (e.g. vernadite, todorokite), were also measured.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditions of measurements:</head><p>Micro-XRF and micro-XANES measurements were performed on beamline ID21. Mn reference compounds were prepared as a powder and spread over a sulfur-free tape. Thin sections (1x1 cm) of nodule samples were mounted between two ultralene® foils. The distribution of Mn in the nodule thin sections was imaged using the scanning X-ray microscope at ID21 beamline <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Susini et al., 2002)</ref>. Samples were scanned in the microscope</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>chamber under vacuum with a monochromatic beam focused by a Fresnel zone plate at a spot size of 0.25 x 0.75 µm2 (VxH, FWHM). The microprobe intensity was 9.10 9 ph s -1 with a storage ring current of 200 mA. The Mn Kα fluorescence line was excited with an energy of 6.7 keV and its intensity was recorded using a photodiode. The integration time per pixel was 100 ms. Maps of several hundreds of µm 2 were recorded. Mn K-edge XANES spectra were recorded from 6.52 to 6.7 keV in 485 points with 0.3 s counting time using a fixed exit double-cristal Si111 monochromator of energy resolution 0.75 eV at 6.6 keV. Reference spectra were measured on reference powders with a large beam (100 µm) in transmission mode with a photodiode. Due to the fragility of the samples, the thin sections of the nodules could not be pepared thin enough to perform measurements in the transmission mode. Micro-XANES measurements at the Mn K-edge were perfomed in the fluorescence mode on the thin sections of the nodule samples on selected spots covering a large range of Mn abundances. Three to four spectra were measured at one spot and averaged. The incident beam energy was calibrated using a foil of elemental Mn(0).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis:</head><p>XANES spectra were processed and analyzed using the Horae Athena free software <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Newville, 2001 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Ravel and Newville, 2005)</ref>. Linear combination analyses were attempted to determine the mineralogical composition of the Mn minerals in the nodules. A pre-edge analysis of the Mn K-edge spectra was performed as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chalmin et al. (2009)</ref> using the free software Fityk <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Wojdyr, 2010)</ref> to determine the local speciation of Mn in the nodule layers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Five samples (4 nodules and 1 crust) were analyzed during the 12 shifts. Nodules consist of micro layers which are irregularly and concentrically banded around a nucleus (compressed sediment, fragment of igneous rock or older nodule). Micro-layers show different reflectivity under the optical microscope due to different chemical and mineralogical compositions. Light-colored layers usually show high Mn content (30-40 %wt) and low Fe content (1-3 %wt), as shown by microprobe analysis. Bulk XRD measurements revealed that Mn minerals in these layers consist of tectomanganate todorokite and phyllomanganate birnessite. Mn minerals are of diagenetic origin (precipitation from the porewater) and the expected Mn redox state is between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ . In the dark-colored layers of the nodules, Mn is less abundant (20 %wt) and Fe is enriched (up to 23 %wt). Mn minerals form under hydrogenetic conditions (precipitation from the seawater under oxic conditions) and consist of vernadite intergrown with amorphous feroxyhyte and Mn redox state is expected to be Mn 4+ . Measurements at ID21 were performed to bring information on the mineralogy and the Mn redox state in the Mn minerals at the sub-micron scale. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows the Mn map of the bottom part of nodule 32KG-5c-2 sampled from a core box. Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> shows selected Mn K-edge XANES spectra measured in layers of different Mn concentrations. The white layer on the map has a high Mn content. The analysis of the pre-edges of Mn K-edge XANES spectra measured in the white layer revealed an intermediate Mn redox between Mn3 + and Mn 4+ . However the linear combination analsis of the XANES spectra do not allow to distinguish between between minerals (todorokite and birnessite). The dark layer on the map has a low Mn content. Macro-analyses suggest that the layer is of hydrogenetic formation, therefore vernadite is expected also at the micro-scale.</p><p>However the Mn K-edge XANES spectra measured in the dark layers are very different from the vernadite standard spectrum measured on the powder. Moreover the energy of the preedge of the spectra suggests that Mn is reduced (Mn 2+ ) which is not consistent with the macro analysis. Similar results have been obtained with the other nodules and the crust. Fig. 1b. Selected Mn K-edge XANES spectra measured in layers of different Mn concentration</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>It appears difficult to determine the exact mineralogy of Mn in the different layers of the nodules using the XANES spectra at the Mn K-edge (linear combination fitting). The analysis of the pre-edge centroid allows the determination of the Mn oxidation state in the Mn minerals. However discrepancies were observed between the bulk analysis of the nodules by XRD and the micro-analysis of the nodule layers. While Mn-rich layers (light-colored on the fluorescence maps) show a redox state of Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ , Mn-poor layers (dark-colored layers) apparently show a reduced state of Mn (Mn 2+ ). The Mn-poor layers have been shown to contain vernadite (Mn 4+ ). The Mn K-edge spectrum of the reference vernadite measured with a macro beam is consistent with the literature (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chalmin et al. 2009</ref>) while the spectra measured in the dark layers of the nodule and crust samples are very different from the reference and show a reduced oxidation state. It is possible that the "vernadite" component in the nodules get reduced under the conditions of the micro-beam used in theXray microscope. Other species such as MnO 2 were apparently stable under the beam. We have to test the stability of vernadite and other standards under the micro-beam.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1a .</head><label>1a</label><figDesc>Fig. 1a.
