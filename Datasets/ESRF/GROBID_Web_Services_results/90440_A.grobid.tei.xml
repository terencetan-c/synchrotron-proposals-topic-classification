<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>In modern low-temperature air-hydrogen fuel cells, carbon-supported Pt-containing materials are employed as catalysts for the ORR. Due to scarcity and the high cost of Pt, some Pt-free alternatives have been proposed, combining transition metals like Fe and Co and non-metals like N, P, S on a carbonaceous support. Both Fe and Co are known participating in the ORR, but their roles in heterogeneous system remain debated. This experiment was seeking to determine the origin of enhanced catalytic activity by monitoring Fe and Co sites behavior by means of XAS during cycling in a model electrochemical cell.</p><p>The catalyst was obtained in a two-step process. At the first, a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) with a desired cobalt content was synthesized and then enriched with an iron salt. This complex precursor was pyrolyzed at the second step, resulting in a porous N-doped carbon (made of amorphous carbon and bamboo-like CNT), containing Co and Fe nanoparticles. This material expressed an enhanced catalytic activity in the ORR, as it was found in previous studies. The enhanced catalytic activity was supposed to be originating from the ongoing parallel reactions or several metals participating in the ORR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details</head><p>In situ and operando XANES and EXAFS spectra were collected simultaneously at Fe and Co K-edges at the BM23 beamline of ESRF. X-ray absorption spectra were processed in a standard way by using Demeter software for normalization, background subtraction and Fourier-analysis. Principle component analysis of normalized XANES spectra with rotation of basis vectors was performed in FitIt 3.0.</p><p>For in situ experiment (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the 1 mm quartz glass capillary were filled with the samples and blocked by a quartz wool from both sides. The capillaries were fixed in the metal holder, which was situated inside the microreactor (a resistive heater) allowing for measurements in the transmission mode. The constant flow of Ar (12 ml/min) was allowed through the capillary limited by a Bronkhorst mass flow controller. The Fe and Co K-edge spectra were collected in the 7.0 -7.6 keV and 7.6 -8.3 keV ranges, respectively. The energy step in the pre-edge and XANES regions was set to 5 and 0.5 eV, respectively, with 2 s acquisition per point. In EXAFS region, the constant step in k-space of 0.05 Å -1 was chosen with acquisition time increasing quadratically from 2 to 4 s. The measurements were performed on sample at room temperature (RT) and heated at 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C. For in operando XAS measurements of the sample under cyclic voltammetry (CV) using BioLogic SP-50 potentiostat. The electrochemical cell provided by ESRF was employed, and the measurements were arranged in the fluorescence mode (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The EWE vs ERHE values were acquired continuously from 1.000 to -0.170 V with the scan rate 0.120 mV/s. Fe and Co Kedge spectra were collected in fluorescence mode in 7.0 -7.6 keV and 7.6 -8.1 keV ranges, respectively. The energy step of 5 and 0.5 eV was used in the pre-edge and XANES regions, respectively, and 0.05 Å -1 step was used in EXAFS region, with 2 s per point acquisition time.</p><p>A 28 µl of the catalytic ink were casted onto a glassy carbon plate of 1 cm 2 and left to dry for 1 h. This plate served as a working electrode in a three-electrode electrochemical cell filled with 0.1 M HClO4 solution. The cell had a Kapton film window allowing the passage of X-rays. A counter electrode was the Pt wire and the Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl solution) electrode was employed as a reference. The plane of the working electrode was positioned to have the 45° angle against both incoming X-ray light beam and the X-ray fluorescence detector (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 right</ref>). The distance between the working electrode and the Kapton window was minimized to reduce the absorption of X-ray photons in the electrolyte. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Study of Co behavior under in operando CV</head><p>Operando XAS data at the Co K-edge collected during CV were analyzed by MCR-ALS method and two main components were extracted (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Small changes in the XANES region were observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>) while the EXAFS part was found to be identical for both components (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). All maxima in the FT analysis of EXAFS of the two components are occurring at the same R-values as in the Co foil (green dashed line in Figure <ref type="figure">b</ref>) including higher R-region, but their intensities are slightly lower. This indicates that metallic Co NPs with fcc structure are present in the sample. The first-shell FT-analysis of EXAFS data provides with the following values of the characteristic parameters: 1) the first shell interatomic distance, RCo-Co = 2.50 ± 0.01 Å, 2) the Debye-Waller parameter, σ 2</p><p>Co-Co = 0.006 ± 0.001 Å 2 , 3) the coordination number, NCo-Co = 9.8 ± 1.1. Within the experimental error, the identical values of R and σ 2 were obtained for both components and for the reference Co foil.</p><p>The coordination number of 9.8, which corresponds to the particle size of ca. 2 nm (assuming an ideal spherical shape).</p><p>Given the EXAFS data do not change during the ORR, the small changes in XANES region may be indicative for some alteration in the electronic state of surface atoms. In particular, the growth of the first near-edge peak at E = 7725 eV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) can be a signature of surface oxidation (Co-O bonds). This feature was observed evolve under changing potential of the working electrode: it appears at around 0.5 V and gradually disappears with decreasing potential. It restores when the potential reaches 0.2 V. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Study of Fe behavior under in operando CV</head><p>The Fe content in the samples is considerably lower than that of Co. In particular, for the catalyst with Co:Zn = 2:1 nominal composition, which was found the most active and stable in the ORR, the ratio of remaining (after pyrolysis) Co:Fe = 15:1 wt% as found by the XRF measurements. A poor quality of Fe K-edge XAS does not allow to analyze the time-evolution of Fe species.</p><p>Therefore, all 12 spectra collected during one cycle (solid lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) were averaged. The position of the edge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>) is close to that of the reference iron foil; therefore, iron is expected to be in the Fe 0 -state. At the same time strong EXAFS oscillation in the χ(k) representation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>) implies the presence of a metallic neighbor (either Fe or Co). This is because the non-metal neighbors such as O, N, or C would not cause strong oscillations at high k (above ~ 6 Å -1 ).</p><p>The FT of EXAFS contains a strong metal-metal contribution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>) but the positions and the shape of peaks are different from those of the reference Fe-foil. Such discrepancy can take place when the local structure of Fe atoms in the sample is different from the bcc arrangement of a bulk iron. Based on such qualitative analysis one may assume that Fe atoms are in zero oxidation state in the mixed Fe-Co NPs. In order to prove the assumption, the first FT-analysis on kweighted data in k range from 2 to 8.5 Å -1 was performed, and the fitting results are following: 1) the first shell interatomic distance, RFe-Fe = 2.52 ± 0.01 Å, 2) the Debye-Waller parameter, σ 2</p><p>Fe-Fe = 0.002 ± 0.003 Å 2 , 3) the coordination number, NFe-Fe = 5.1 ± 1.4.</p><p>The R-factor is of 0.023 and the reduced χ 2 is of 3.39.</p><p>The fit with Fe-Co contribution gives the following values: 1) the first shell interatomic distance, RFe-Co = 2.52 ± 0.01 Å, 2) the Debye-Waller parameter, σ 2 Fe-Co = 0.004 ± 0.003 Å 2 , 3) the coordination number, NFe-Co = 6.4 ± 1.5.</p><p>Accordingly, the R-factor is of 0.017 and the reduced χ 2 is of 2.46. By comparing the fitting results within two approaches, the fit with Fe-Co contribution gives a better agreement and reaches a reasonable value of σ 2 . The fit performed using bcc structure gave bad agreement with unreasonable results. Although it is usually difficult to distinguish Fe (Z = 26) and Co (Z = 27) neighbors from EXAFS analysis, the combination of the abovementioned facts provides a strong indication in favor of conclusion that there are Fe atoms embedded in Co NPs. Considering the low coordination of Fe atoms, one may assume that Fe atoms are preferentially located on the surface of Co NPs.</p></div>
