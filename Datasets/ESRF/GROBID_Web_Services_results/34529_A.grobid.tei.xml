<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Predicted theoretically by Freiser more than 30 years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the biaxial nematic phase N b has been a contsant challenge in liquid crystal (LC) research. However, in spite of the significant theoretical and simulation work, it was only recently that strong experimental evidence has been produced for the existence of such mesophase in a low molar mass bent-core thermotropic mesogen <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The announcement has created considerable excitement, for it opened new areas of both fundamental and applied research. The discovery has important implications. For example, recent electro-optic switching experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> on bent-core N b demonstrated that the response of the short moelcule axis m to an applied field is indeed much faster than that of the long molecular axis n (the nematic director), a results that is expetced to be the herald of application in fast electro-optical switching devices. From a fundamental point of view, the exietsnce of a biaxial nematic raises the question of the mechanism underlying its formation. In addition, it opens a new frontier field addressed to the relationships between N biaxiality and macroscopic ferroelectric ordering in the N mesophase. Indeed, ferroelectricity is another intriguing and much sought after feature in nematics and a ferroelectric response has been recently demonstrated for the first time in the nematic (N) phase of a class of banana-shaped (BS) mesogens with asymmetric 1,2,4-oxadiazoles cores <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In this experiment we have carried out an X-ray diffraction (XRD) study of a bent-core LC mesogen with chemical structure similar to thaose of refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, that displays the potentially biaxial nematic phase. The main aim was to achieve full characterization of this unusual state of matter and possibly to provide evidence of the true biaxial nature of the mesophase. The structure of the investigated bent-core LC mesogen, ODBP-Ph-OC 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), is based on the 2,5-substituted oxadiazole heterocycle ring, specifically the oxadiazole biphenol (ODBP) core. This homologous term of the series ODBP-Ph-OC n has the shortest terminal alkyl chains and exhibits only a nematic phase that, according to preliminary optical studies, appeared to be biaxial (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The unusually wide thermal range (175°C-280°C) offered a unique opportunity of investigation even though the high transition temperatures were experimentally challenging. XRD analysis was carried out (i) on capillary sample uniaxially aligned under a static magnetic field B (up to 0.6 T) and (ii) on planar LC cell sample (20 µm) aligned under the combined action of a static magnetic field B (nornal to the x-ray beam) and of a low-frequency (0-500 Hz) electric field E (up to 10 5 V/m) applied across the cell (parallel to the beam). The sample planar cell was be prepared using two ultra-thin (100 µm) glass plates coated with a conductive ITO-film (50 µm). These glass plates were further coated with a thin film of SiO x deposited under vacuum at 60° evaporation angle in order to achieve strong planar anchoring and homogeneous in plane orientation of the nematic director n parallel to a reference direction r. The cells were then assembled with the glass plates facing their coated sides in a parallel-plane configuration and separated by high precision spacers. Finally, the cell (1cm x 1cm) was filled by capillary with the LC in the fluid phase and then slowly cooled down to room temperature. We have studied the mesomorphic behavior of the samples over the entire mesophasic range as function of temperature.</p><p>The XRD measurements on the capillary sample revealed a peculiar pattern characterized by the splitting of the low-angle signal into four symmetrically-located diffuse spots (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In principle, this atypical N pattern could have been interpreted either in terms of the V-shape of the mesogen and the intrinsic structure of the N in the n-m plane (within the model of N biaxility of ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>) or in terms of the cybotactic structure of the N (i.e. a N consisting of a conglomerate of cybotactic clusters endowed with pronounced short-range SmClike ordering) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The measurements carried out on the planar cell sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) allowed us to discriminate between these two models. In fact, with no applied electric field (and also B=0) we measured a four-spot pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>) very similar to that of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> with the only difference that now the planar orientating action along the reference direction r was provided by the surface anchoring. With applied electric field E, no changes occurred until the field strength exceeded the threshold for the Fredericks transition for reorientation when the two pairs of reflections at small angle changed to the isotropic diffuse ring of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref>. These results unambiguously rule out the molecular V-shape and intrinsic structure of the N <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> as the origin of the peculiar four-spot pattern whereas they agree quite well with the model of the cybotactic N <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Accordingly, the pattern change from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref> to Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref> is no more a sufficient condition for biaxility that, on the contrary, require additional experimental evidences to be firmly and finally established.  B Fig.3. SAXS pattern of the capillary sample of ODBP-Ph-OC 4 uniaxially aligned under static magnetic field in the N phase at T=230°C.  4A a roration of the four-spot pattern is clearly apparent, which is the consequence of a uniform reorientation of the long moelcular axes (hence the nematic director n) towards the direction of B. This is consistent with the positive diamagnetic anisotropy of the mesogen which reorients the long axes parallel to B. The parallel alignemnt to B in Fig. <ref type="figure">3C</ref> is not perfectly achieved because of the competing actions of surface anchoring and magnetic field. Based on the above results, we can conclude that it is possible to get monodomain cell samples where the orientations of the two axes n,m are individually and simultaneously controlled by external magnetic and electric field, respectively. This result is key for any future XRD study aimed at establishing the biaxial nature of the nematic, opening the possibility of aligning at command the monodomain sample in different ways with respect to the x-ray beam, hence the possibility of probing the structural organization of the mesophase along distinct directions. In view of a a future study fully oriented to the question of the biaxility of these N mesophases, this opportunity will have to be further combined with an extension of the investigated q range to the WAXS region in order to cover the typical average intermolecular distanced involved in these soft condensed materials (a few Å).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1The chemical structure of the bent-core mesogen ODBP-Ph-OC4 along with its phase sequences and transition temperatures.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,67.02,70.56,225.00,73.38" type="bitmap" /></figure>
