<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The object of these experiments was to test whether the high-energy resolution fluorescence detection (HERFD) method at the 5f M 4 and M 5 edges, where a core-hole is formed in the 3d shell and electron promoted to the 5f valence band, would shed some light on the valence of intermetallic uranium 5f materials, as it has been successful with insulating uranium oxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The principal motivation was to examine samples of URu 2 Si 2 , which has been one of the most enigmatic materials in actinide physics and about which there has been much speculation as to the ground state of the 5f electrons.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the HEFRD spectra at the M 4 edge for 5 different samples, two of URu 2 Si 2 (one cleaved and the other exposed to air), and single crystals of UO 2 , UPd 3 , and USb. From a body of earlier work, the nominal valencies of the last 3 samples are UO 2 -5f 2 , UPd 3 -5f 2 , and USb -5f 3 . On the basis of the work on UO 2 and higher oxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> we would expect a shift of ~ 1 eV for a valence change of 1, i.e. the peak should shift by -1 eV for U(IV) 5f 2 → U(III) 5f 3 . Although USb spectrum does have more weight to the lower energy side, the peak has clearly not shifted significantly. An examination of the HERFD spectra at the M 5 edge showed similar curves.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, we show some of the resonent emission x-ray spectra (REXS) spectra of URu 2 Si 2 . Clearly there are no significant features away from the line relating E transfer to E incident . However, as shown in the right-hand side of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, we did find an interesting "forbidden" peak just below the main M β flourescence line associated with the hole transferring from the 3d 3/2 → 4f 5/2 shell, and this can be associated with transfer of the hole to the 4f 7/2 shell, which is normally dipole forbidden. This peak existed in all the materials, and was about 1% in intensity of the main M β intensity. One reason for this occurrence could be that the assumption of no J-mixing is not fully justified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>It appears that examining intermetallic compounds, where there is hybridization between the 5f and conduction states (which is not the case in UO 2 ), makes the interpretation of the M 4 and M 5 REXS spectra more complicated than we previously thought. At the moment, such differences of less than 1 eV are beyond the scope of theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These measurements raise some doubt over the interpretation of similar measurements reported by Booth et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> at the actinide L 3 edges, where they have made assignments of the 5f occupation based on interpretation of similar HEFRD data. However, their experiments initially produce the core-hole in the 2p shell with the electron promoted to the 6d valence shell, so our experiments promoting the additional electron in the 5f shell should be more sensitive to the 5f ground state.  Right: Details of the spectra involving transitions from the hole in the 3d 3/2 to the 4f 7/2 state, which is dipole forbidden. This intensity is about 1% of the main peak showing a transfer from 3d 3/2 → 4f 5/2 .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): H.
