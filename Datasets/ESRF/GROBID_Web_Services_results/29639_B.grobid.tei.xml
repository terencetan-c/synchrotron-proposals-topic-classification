<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The compound is chiral -so the most possible space group is P2 1 with two metergoline molecules in asymmetric unit cell. The structure determination performed with program FOX based on search of positions of 2 independent fragments was not fully successful up to now.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risedronate</head><p>High resolution powder diffraction record of risedronate was recorded at 0.69956 Å wavelength and room temperature -fig 2. 1.5 mm capillary was used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig.2 Powder diffraction record of risedronate sodium hydrate</head><p>None good indexation of the record was found by any indexation program. The problem is probably connected to unusual variations in peak width for which we do not have an explanation. The powder pattern corresponds to several others samples data obtained with a laboratory source -so we do not expect the problems are coused by presence of another phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methylergometrine maleate</head><p>In addition to the compounds originally included in the proposal, we had time to measure an additional substance (ergot alkaloid similar to the metergoline). High resolution powder diffraction record of methylergometrin maleate was recorded at 0.69956 Å wavelength and room temperature. 1.5 mm capillary was used. Indexation was done with program DICVOL: orthorhombic cell with following lattice parameters: a= 5.711 (2), b= 12.771 (6), c= 33.15 (2) Å and space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 was suggested. The crystal structure was successfully solved by 2 fragment search in FOX. We have used the known structure of ergometrin as the first fragment and relatively rigid structure of the maleate as the second fragment. The missing methyl atom was found from the difference Fourier map fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>. We continue working on restrained structure refinement in GSAS environment (current Rp=16.5% Rw=19.5 %) fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The structure and packing is similar to already known structure of ergometrine maleate.
