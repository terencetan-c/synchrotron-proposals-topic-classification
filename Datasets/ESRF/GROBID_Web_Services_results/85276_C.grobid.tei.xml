<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>While the complete data set obtained from this beamtime (experiment CH5202) can not be set online due to confidentiality, the basic success of these experiments shall be summed up. A detailed report displaying all data and quantitative analysis was sent to the user office after clearance was given from the material manufacturer.</p><p>Goal of our experiments was the analysis of transition metal dissolution for promising future Li-Ion battery materials in comparison to commercially employed NCM111. We were able to gather operando data on the dissolution behavior of NCM111 in comparison to NCM811 material for all transition metals of interest, e.g. manganese, nickel and cobalt. Due to our unique spectro-electrochemical cell, the concentration in the electrolyte and on the graphite anode could be followed throughout cycling. By a sophisticated electrochemical cycling procedure of the battery cells, we were able to deconvolute the two major dissolution mechanisms for layered transition metal oxide cathode materials: Electrochemical destabilization of the lattice at high state-of-charge and chemical leaching of transition metals by protic species formed out of electrochemical oxidation of the electrolyte at high potential.</p><p>The on-set of transition metal dissolution is caused by electrochemical destabilization of the lattice and sets in at a constant SOC, independent of the potential at which this SOC is reached for different materials. This behavior is of great importance for application of those materials, as they are currently only employed up to a maximum SOC of 70%. Pushing the upper limit above that value, aging of the cell aggravates disproportionally, which can now be linked (among other mechanisms) to the dissolution of transition metals out of the cathode active material, leading to loss of active lithium on the graphite counter electrode and increased cell impedance. Cycling at higher SOC will only be possible if one solves the inherent crystal destabilization problem of the particle surface.</p><p>The main transition metal dissolution however sets in at high potentials, which can be explained by electrochemical electrolyte oxidation forming protic species that leach out transition metals out of the active materials. Onset of this transition metal dissolution very well coincides with the detection of gaseous electrolyte oxidation products. By carefully setting the upper charge cut-off potential and overcharge protector, this region can be avoided in application but will have to be determined independently for different electrolytes.</p><p>Further operando measurements for Li-rich HE-NCM and the high voltage spinel LNMO (as written in the proposal) could not be executed due to two beam drops lasting for several hours, which made us repeat operando measurements as they were interrupted. However, further ex-situ data could be gathered studying the effect of electrolyte solvent, aging cycling at currently employed upper cut-off potential, and purity of the battery casing that is exposed to high potentials and corrodes as well. This data will only be shown in the confidential report sent to the user office as mentioned earlier.</p><p>The great optics enabling a stable, high quality micro-sized X-ray beam inspired us to submit a new proposal <ref type="bibr">(CH 5555)</ref> where this characteristic will be fully utilized. Preliminary data for this new experiment series was gathered during experiment CH 5202 and present a good starting point for a sophisticated homogeneity study.</p><p>A manuscript of the high-quality data gathered during CH 5202 is in preparation. Parts of the results will be presented on an international conference in October 2018.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>original proposal but experimentalist: Armin Siebel*</figDesc></figure>
