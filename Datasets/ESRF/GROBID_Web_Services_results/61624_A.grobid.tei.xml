<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The session at the BM26B DUBBLE from the 6 th to the 7 th of April 2017 was very successful. No difficulties were encountered during the experiment and all planned samples were measured. Following the suggestion of Alessandro Longo, the 311 crystal was used, which lead to very high resolution spectra, especially in the preedge region (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The results were used in a recent publication: Vollmer, I., et al. (2018). "On the dynamic nature of Mo sites for methane dehydroaromatization." Chemical Science. XANES spectra were measured ex-situ at the Mo K-edge in transmission. Those measurements on pelletized samples provide XANES spectra with a very signal to noise ratio. Prior to measurement, the fresh samples were dehydrated under a flow of N 2 at 400 °C for 16 h. CO carburization was performed on a custom-made setup, where a 30 ml/min flow of 2.5% CO in He was continuously fed to the reactor. Effluent gasses were analyzed by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Balzers) connected on-line with the reactor. Mass Spectra were recorded in multiple ion detection (MID) mode using a channeltron detector. Quantification of CO and CO 2 was achieved by calibrating signals with calcium oxalate. [2] Signals were normalized with the signal of He and the fragmentation contribution of CO 2 m/z = 44 was subtracted from m/z = 28. The catalyst was pretreated at 350 °C in He overnight to desorb any adsorbed gasses from the pores of the zeolite. Carburized samples were transferred from the carburization setup to the glovebox without exposure to the atmosphere, where they were packed into custom-made holders under inert atmosphere. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the readouts on the MS during CO carburization at different temperatures. These quasi in-situ results are shown in Figures <ref type="figure">3</ref><ref type="figure">4</ref>for the 2MoHZ-13 and 5MoHZ-13 catalysts. The results confirm a similar carburization state of Mo species obtained by CH 4 pulsing or CO pretreatment. Thus the answer to the question set out in the title can be answered positively. This knowledge will also be used for a future publication, were the same CO-treatment is used to prepare samples for characterization with CO FTIR and 13 C MAS NMR. These experiments helped determine the oxidation state of Mo and three different kind of species were identified to be present on the catalyst. For details please refer to the publication mentioned above.</p></div>
