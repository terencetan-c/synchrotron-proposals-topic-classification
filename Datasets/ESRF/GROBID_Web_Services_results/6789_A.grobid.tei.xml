A fourth data set was measured at h near 1 A. The diffraction images were processed with DENZO and the resulting intensities scaled with SCALEPACK in such a way as to preserve the multiple observations of all the measured Bijvoet mates. The CCP4 program suite was then used to merge the scaled data (ROTAPREP / AGROVATA / TRUNCATE) and to scale together the different wavelength data (SCALEIT). The anomalous difference Patterson map calculated from data with maximal anomalous differences (hz 1.7417 A) showed clear peaks which could be interpreted using RSPS in terms of three of the expected Fe-sites. The remainder of the Fe sites were located by means of successive anomalous Fourier syntheses using as phases the refined protein phases (MLPHARE) from the previously known and refined sites. A total of 8 Fe sites were found, consistent with four monomers in the asymmetric unit. Their positions were used to derive the non-crystallographic symmetry operations between the independent molecules (LSQKAB). Phase refinement with MLPHARE in the resolution range 10 2 d 2 3.0 A converged to an overall f.o.m. of 0.58. Density modification, averaging, solvent flattening and phase extension (20 2 d 2 2.5 A) procedures (DM) produced a much improved electron density map. A polyalanine model was built into this map, corresponding to most of the polypeptide chain trace. This model was used for calculating phases which were combined (SIGMAA) with the original MAD/MLPHARE phases (10 2 d 2 3.0 A) to produce a set of phases with an overall f.o.m. of 0.80. The density modification, averaging, solvent flattening and phase extension (20 2 d 2 2.5 A) procedures (DM) were then used to further improve the electron density map. This map allowed a very nearly complete trace of the electron density and a polyalanine model containing 232 residues was built. This number of residues is reasonably consistent with the monomer molecular weight of 26.3 KDa and results in a unit cell solvent content of about 40%. The aminoacid sequence of this protein is not yet available and therefore a more complete model building and verification has not yet been possible.</figDesc></figure>
