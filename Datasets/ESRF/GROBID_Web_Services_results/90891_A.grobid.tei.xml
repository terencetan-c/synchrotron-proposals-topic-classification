The first reported low internal resistance supercapacitors, electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), were made of carbonaceous materials in which the charge storage was predominantly achieved by double-layer capacitance of physical separation of charges. The simplicity and high stability of EDLCs made them very attractive. However, with capacitance only in the range of 100-300 F/g, they do not meet the requirements for modern energy-storage devices. More recently pseudocapacitors, in which charge is primarily stored through reversible electrochemical processes (redox, electro-sorption and/or intercalation) on the electrode surface, have attracted attention due to their intrinsically higher capacitance.</p><p>Currently we are developing a simple, scalable and novel approach to produce super-capacitive high graphene content materials that uses a biopolymer to prepare 3D carbon nanocomposite doped with highly dispersed Co-Ni nanoparticles.</p><p>Persimmon tannin and chitosan were employed as the carbon source. Persimmon tannin contains a number of adjacent hydroxyphenyl groups, which are suitable ligands for transition-metal ions such as Ni and Co ions. During the carbonization process, the complexes were decomposed into metal nanoparticles doped carbon. Meanwhile, metal nanoparticles catalyzed the formation of 3D graphene. The materials produced from this approach were well characterized through different spectroscopic techniques, and the electro-chemical properties of this material also shows great improvement in its supercapacities. By analysing this system with synchrotron-based operando CV-SAXS experiment the size and distribution of these embedded nanoparticle in relation to the electrochemical performance of this nanocomposite can be further understood at the nano-scopic level. On the other hand, the impact of charging-discharging on the microstructure of this nanocomposite material can be better illustrated through the in-situ SAXS-WAXS analyses. As shown in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the application of voltage on the G-CoO-NiO really changed the sample's WAXS pattern at diffraction angle around 14 and 16 degree. These peaks can be found correspondign to CoO peaks, this turn demonstrate the redox reaction happened during the charge-discharge cycle is predominantly a CoO to Co based reaction. Further study is needed to understand the role of Ni in this reaction. On the other hand, it seems that there is no change in the SAXS profiles for this redox reaction, which indicates a good dispersion of NP in the carbon supports, and no aggregation appeared during redox reactions.</p><p>Next step, we plan to use the same setup to study a series of different nanocomposite to see the impact of its morphology on its electrochemical performance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
