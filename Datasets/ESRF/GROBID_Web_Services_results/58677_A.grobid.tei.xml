To date, CaMn7O12 is the multiferroic where this coupling between electric and magnetic polarisation is most pronounced. On the other hand, this coupling is absent in isostructural NaMn7O12 due to the subtle change in average Mn valence state. We seek to learn more about the nature of this coupling mechanism by studying the solid solution Ca1-xNaxMn3Mn4O12 by high resolution powder diffraction. Our results will allow us to ascertain the nature of any charge and orbital ordering which are intrinsically linked to the observed multiferroic phenomena and will point towards how new and improved materials can be designed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>During our beamtime on high resolution powder diffractometer ID22 we measued a solid solution series Ca1-xNaxMn3Mn4O12 and La1-xCax Mn3Mn B 4O12 at Δx = 0.1 and 0.2 respectively as a function of temperature (from 700 K down to 10 K). The beamtime was highly successful with typical samples displaying peaks with FWHM of 1/100 th degree at ~ 20 degrees 2-theta with clearly resolvable diffraction peaks out to a d-spacing of 0.45 Å. This has enabled us to map out the crystallographic phase transitions assoicated with the change of valence state on Mn B implied by the doping (change in x). Our work evidence four low temperature regmies that are coupled to the orbiral ordering on the B site. At Mn 3+ and Mn 3.25+ our results are consistent with Ctype orbital ordering in planes perpendicular to the [001] and <ref type="bibr">[111]</ref> directions resepectivley. However at Mn 3.5+ and Mn 3.35+ two pesudo symmetric monolicinic phases are observed. Our Rietveld refinemetns suggest that these have distinct strucutre from each other. Single crystal experiements to ascertain more precisley the microscoipic nature of these orbital ordered phases will shead further further detail on this. Work on anlysing the data is ongoing and we anticipate it will lead to a journal article publication.</p><p>During our beam time we also measure analogous compound HgMn7O12 at 10, 80, 300, 500 and 700K, demonstrating a sequence of novel charge tranfer and charge and orbital ordering transitions ( Fig1: The structure of the phases of HgMn7O12. Top panel, high-temperature cubic aristotype Im¯3; middle, R¯3 orbital disorder phase; bottom, Pnn2, double charge-ordered, polar phase. The color key indicates the formal valence states of Mn sites assigned based on analysis of the crystal structure. The orange bonds represent the Jahn-Teller long bonds (dz orbital order) of the Mn3+. The R¯3 phase has four apparent Jahn-Teller long bonds in the unit cell which are actually an average of two short and two long bonds, observed on account of the orbital disorder. There is a charge transfer of one electron per unit cell from B-to A′-site on going from R¯3 to Pnn2, which acts to remove the orbital disordered state and facilitates the double charge order on the A′-and B-site.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Fig2: The origin of the improper polarization in HgMn7O12. The reversal of one or the other of the two primary order parameters responsible for the doublecharge ordering (H+4 and H-2H-3) on the A′-and B-sites is sufficient to reverse the direction of the polarization (P); reversal of both order parameters returns the polarization to its initial state. The short second-nearest-neighbor Mn-O distance (∼2.4Å) that is indicative of the MnA′2+ state is shown in yellow.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,280.08,209.40,168.00,144.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
