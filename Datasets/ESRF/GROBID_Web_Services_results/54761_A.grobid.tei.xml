<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The metal insulator transition (MIT) is of enduring interest, underlying key principles of condensed matter physics. Many materials exhibit a Mott MIT, i.e. one driven by Coulomb interactions (U). Such a transition is purely electronic and is independent of magnetic correlations. In contrast, a "Slater transition" is one driven purely by magnetic correlations: the development of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. The onset of NÃ©el order induces a periodic potential on each neighbouring ion and opens up a continuous charge gap below the MIT. This MIT is also distinguished by an absence of any structural distortion through the MIT.</p><p>Osmates constitute the only realization of the Slater transition in three dimensions to date. Bulk measurements <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> revealed that the perovskite osmate NaOsO 3 undergoes an MIT concomitantly with antiferromagnetic order (T N = T MIT = 410 K). Neutron powder diffraction <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> revealed that this magnetic order was G-type, and optical conductivity measurements [3] demonstrated a zero temperature charge gap of 100 meV, which closes continuously towards the MIT. All of these observations are consistent with a Slater picture. However at the time of the experiment there had not been any determination of the magnetic or orbital excitations for NaOsO 3 . Since T N is coincident with the MIT, then it is likely that the electronic and magnetic correlations are intimately linked. The motivation was thus to determine the behaviour of the magnetic excitations.</p><p>The RIXS experiment was performed at the Os L 3 edge (10.871 keV) on a single crystal of NaOsO 3. This crystal had dimensions 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 mm 3 and was oriented such that the (1 0 1) direction was normal to the crystal face. Low resolution measurements were carried out using a Si (311) channel-cut secondary monochromator and Si (664) diced analyser, providing a total energy resolution of 275 meV. For high resolution measurements, a Si (664) backscattering channel cut secondary monochromator was used along with the aforementioned analyser, and total energy resolution of 46 meV. Low resolution measurements determined the choice of incident energy to use for the remainder of the experiment. These measurements revealed orbital excitations consistent with those collected previously at the APS, and hence the incident energy was selected as 10.880 keV, since this maximised the intensity of the intrat 2g excitations.</p><p>The low energy RIXS spectra collected in the (5 3 4) Brillouin zone are displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Each spectrum was collected for four hours using the high-resolution setup. There is a clearly dispersing feature at approximately 100 meV, which appears to be gapped. Fitting the intensity and energy of this feature to a J 1 -J 2 Hamiltonian plus some degree of single-ion anisotropy gave exchange parameters consistent with quantum chemistry calculations (unpublished), however the gap is somewhat larger than that predicted.</p><p>Unfortunately it was not possible to gain a full temperature dependence of the observed feature for two main the reasons. The first was that there were approximately three shifts lost due to accelerator problems. The second is an intrinsic weak signal which is distinct from the aforementioned accelerator issue. The poor signalto-noise ratio (despite counting for four hours per spectrum) meant that data collection was limited. A similarly weak signal for the following experiment (HC-1534) may imply a transient beamline related problem. Preliminary measurements suggest that the spin gap may close continuously towards the MIT, however this is somewhat unclear.</p><p>Nevertheless these results show a distinct difference in the low energy excitations compared to the pyrochlore osmate Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 , despite a similar local crystalline environment <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. The well-defined spin wave excitations seen at low temperature for NaOsO 3 are a clear indication that a localized spin picture is appropriate for this material. Further measurements are proposed to look at the temperature dependence in more detail.  Figure 1: Crystal structure of NaOsO 3 . The magnetic moments are oriented in the c-direction and coupled antiferromagnetically.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>[ 1 ]</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Shi et al., Phys.
