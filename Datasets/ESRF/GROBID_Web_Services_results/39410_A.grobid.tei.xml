<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was focused on the influence of interlayer dielectric material (ILD) on the temperature dependence of the stress in copper interconnect structures. The continuous increase of transistor density on microelectronic devices requires a proportional shrinking of the on-chip interconnect structures. Modern copper interconnect structures have line widths of less than 200 nm and are build on more than 9 different levels. The complex structure and the small dimensions result in very strict requirements for the mechanical stability of the system. Metal structures that are exposed to mechanical stress may show deformation if the stress increases above a certain level. Under normal production and operation conditions this level is globally not exceeded, however on a local level stress gradients may build up and copper migration phenomena can be observed. This migration can lead to void formation and in the case of thin lines to a complete interrupt and device failure.</p><p>Large arrays of parallel copper interconnect lines with different linewiths were measured at the copper (111) reflection in the side-inclination mode. This mode, where the diffraction geometry is keeped constant and the sample is tilted in Chi and Phi, enables the calculation of the full 3Dstress state. The measurement of higher angle reflections would yield better stress resolution and lower error bars, but diffraction intensity was not sufficient to utilize this setup. The small structure sizes, especially the small structure height, lead to very low diffraction volumes, so that the highest possible beam intensity has to be focused on the sample. One sample with a slight overpolish, were the structure height was reduced below 100nm, was nearly unmeasurable in the current experimental setup. As heights below this range will become common in the predictable future it was decided that a mayor upgrade of beam optics and and detector sensitivity is needed for project continuation.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a sample with a special ILD material. The stress temperature curve shows a completely different behaviour compared to normal low-k or ultra-low-k materials (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The last process step for all samples is the addition of a capping layer at higher temperatures. The different coefficients of thermal expansions (CTE) lead to a tensile stress in the copper structures at room temperature after the cooling down. When the samples are heated up again, normally the stress decreases more or less linearly, whereas the rate of decrease depends on all the different materials CTEs and the geometry. The stress than reaches a zero level at a given temperature, that is not necessaryly the same as the capping layer deposition temperature. This due to irreversible processes like copper grain growth or chemical interlayer reactions that can take place. Further temperature increase leads to compressive stress, that reaches a constant level when copper yielding (plastic deformation) or ILD deformation begins. The sample with the special ILD material shows a small increase of tensile stress in the first heating step, this may be due to the sample preparation. The sample cutout enables adsorbtion of water and other species from air which is prevented in the normal production process. The desorption changes the ILD volume and induces additional stress in the copper structures. Further heating decreases the stress, but with a much lower rate compared to the other samples. An explanation for this issue is even more speculative as further desorbtion, unusual thermal or thermo-elastic properties are possible. With higher temperatures the stress decreases very fast and turns compressive. A stress plateau trough beginning yielding is not observed and maybe covered by different processes. The examined ILD material shows much more complicated behaviour than expected and further analysis is going on for better understanding. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 ultra low-k low-k stress temperature / °C Figure 2: Stress-Temperature curve of samples with "common" low-k, ultra low-k ILD Material (taken for comparision from last report)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Stress-Temperature curve of a sample with special ILD material</figDesc></figure>
