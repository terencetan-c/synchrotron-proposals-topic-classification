Plastic debris includes tiny plastic fragments, fibers and granules. Depending on their size, they are classified as microplastics (polymer fragments &lt;5 mm in size) and nanoplastics (&lt;1000 nm). They are used in consumer products or formed by the breakdown of larger polymer particles. To date, most environmental studies regarding the fate and effects of micro-and nano-plastics have been focused on marine ecosystems. However, recent studies show that agricultural soils are also a major sink of plastics. Plastic waste arrives to soils mainly through the application of sewage sludge, biowaste digestates and through the use of plastic mulch films.Nanoplastics are of particular concern because a recent study showed that they can be taken up by plants with the potential to bioaccumulate and biomagnify through the food chain. However, there is still very limited information about the uptake and effects of nanoplastics on plants, the main reason is the lack of analytical methods to detect nanoplastics in complex organic matrix such us plant tissues.</p><p>In the present study, wheat plants were grown in hydroponics and exposed to Pd-doped nanoplastics at various concentrations. Plant growth and different physiological parameters were determined. Nanoplastic accumulation in plant tissues was determined based on Pd concentration by ICP-MS. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro X Ray fluorescece (µXRF) showed nanoplastic accumulated in the surface of root forming aggregates of several microns.</p><p>The pourpose of the present experiment was to perform 3D imaging at sub-micron scale using computed microtomography (µCT) available at id19 in order to: 1) study the effects of nanoplastics in root anatomy and, ii) test if phase contrast can be used to locate nanoplastic aggregates in roots.</p><p>To this end, after exposure to nanoplastics, plant roots were prepared by critical point drying. They were mounted into small plastic vials and subjected to synchrotron-computed microtomography in ID19 beamline at the ESRF. Scans were acquired at 26.5 keVs, close to Pd K-edge (24.3 keVs). In total 4000 projections were acquired with a spatial resolution of 0.72µm and an acquisition time of 50ms each over a rotation of 360°. The images were reconstructed using the Paganin´s method applying a delta/beta ratio of 300.</p><p>A total of 42 samples were analysed including different areas of the roots, exposure conditions and replicates. Overall, the experiment was very succesfull, the quality of the obtained 3D reconstructions was very good (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Currently, we are finalizing the segmentation of the volumes that will provide information about the density and local thicknes of cell walls and about cell volumens in the epidermis, cortex and stele of roots. We are writing the article related with these results. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Example of root volumen reconstruction</figDesc><graphic coords="3,125.00,174.84,350.60,164.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
