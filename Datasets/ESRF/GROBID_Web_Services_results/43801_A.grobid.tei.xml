<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Heme-copper oxidases are integral membrane proteins which serve as the final electron acceptor of respiratory chains across all kingdoms of life. These integral membrane proteins accept electrons so as to reduce oxygen to water and thereby exploit the chemical energy released to pump protons. Given the complexity of these processes, it is essential to determine any effect of changes in protonation state of groups near the catalytic centre. Such groups are likely to play essential roles in these functionally important conformational changes. Most proposed proton-pumping mechanisms involve CuB site and its histidine ligands. The existence and identity of such reorganization of the CuB geometry caused by protonation/deprotonation and/or breakage of one of the Cu-N(His) bonds is a difficult matter to either prove or disprove since CuB is spectrally silent. Since the Ubiquinol oxidase consists just one Cu site and two Fe atoms it's ideal candidat to apply X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study what hapen near the Cu-site when Cu changes its oxidation state and to study pH dependence of the Cu site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quality of measurement/data and status / progress of evaluation:</head><p>Spectra have been mesured in solution (placed in the cappilary) in fluoresence mode using 13-element fluoresence detector. The Cu K-edge spectra have been collected in room temperature and 80 K (the cryostream has been used to cool down a sample) and in the pH range: 6.5-9.5. Several scans of the Fe K-edge have been mesured as well. Due to the fast photoreduction of the Fe K-edge (a hundrigs seconds) we decided not continue to mesure spectra at the Fe K-edge and collect more scans for the Cu K-edge. 380 scans have been mesured in total. Photoreduction of the Cu K-edge has been studied by collecting a set of scans (5 scans for 40 minutes) for each fresh sample in the pH range: 6.5-9.5. Then the principal component analysis (PCA) using the FitIt softwear <ref type="bibr">[G. Smolentsev, Comp. Matter. Science 39, (2007)</ref>, 69] has been applied to check how many intermidiates consist each brunch of spectra for the fresh sample. Results presented in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> indicat the presence only two components in the set of spectra. We got the same results for all pH concentrations. Cu K-edges for oxidazed, photo-reduced and dithionite-reduced forms in the pH range 6.5-9-5 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> The energy and shape of the oxidazed edges and photo-reduced edges correspondingly remain unchanged in the whole pH range that demostrate that there is no structural change of the Cu enviroment in the pH 6.5-9.5 range. The structure refinement from XANES spectra using nonmuffintin simulations (FDMNES code [Y. Joly, Phys. Rev. B 63, 125120-125129 (2001)]) and FitIt softwear for fiting procedure of the spectra is currently under way. Preliminary results indicate that the Cu site is surrounded by three His for reduced state and by three histidines and a water molecule or hydroxile for oxidased state. The best fit results are shown in the Fig.3. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>We report the X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies of the copper edge of the cytochrome bo3 quinol oxidase from Escherichia coli. Our results indicate that CuB changed its associated ligands for oxidised Cu(II) and reduced Cu(I) states of the protein. However room temperature copper K-edge X-ray absorption spectra remains unchanged in the pH range 6.5-9.5 for both oxidised and reduced forms of copper correspondently, indicating that no structural changes takes place at CuB depending on pH. Work has been presented as a poster in SBNet 2010 (Sweden) and ESRF User meeting 2011.</p><p>8940 8960 8980 9000 9020 9040 9060 9080 9100 9120 0,00 0,25 0,50 0,75 1,00 1,25 1,50 1,75 2,00 Energy (eV) 0 2 4 6 8 10 0,000 0,005 0,010 Number of components IE</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
