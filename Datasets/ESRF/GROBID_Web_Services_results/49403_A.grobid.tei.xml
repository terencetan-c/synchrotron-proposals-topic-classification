<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments performed under experiment number MX1383 were a continuation of the work performed under experiment number MX1342. Using the information gained from the first beamtime allocation, we were able to more efficiently and effectively mount the small and extremely thin crystals that we are able to grow. While our first beamtime yielded diffraction for only 4/50 crystals, our second beamtime yielded diffraction data for 40 of the 60 crystals we were able to screen but the best diffraction we see is still limited to no greater than 4Å. We were also able to collect several hundred frames of data on 20 of these crystals and were able to observe loss of resolution as a function of xray exposure.</p><p>The data collected during this experiment has led us to the conclusion that one of our cell axes is quite long, somewhere between 300 and 400Å. We also suspect that the mosaicity along one of the axes is quite high. We believe that the only way to collect a complete data set is to collect data along the thin edges of the crystals, which is made difficult due to the fact that the plates are no more than 2 or 3 um thick and are difficult to see in the context of the mounting loop. The crystals are also very flexible, which makes data collection along the thin edge quite challenging.</p><p>In summary, the beamtime allocated to this project has enabled us to test the diffraction of more than 100 crystals of very large complexes of eukaryotic DNA polymerase epsilon in complex with its DNA substrates. Unfortunately, we have not been able to collect useful data due inherent pathologies in the crystal lattice. We are now directing all efforts to obtaining new crystal morphologies that will be more amenable to collection of usable diffraction data. </p></div>			</div>
