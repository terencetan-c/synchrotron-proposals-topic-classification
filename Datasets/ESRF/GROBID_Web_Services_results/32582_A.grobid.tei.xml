<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The following report includes discussions about :</p><p>1. General observations about our first run at the ESRF 2. The problems and solutions linked to the sample preparation 3. Results about FTIR spectroscopy and mapping 4. Results about X ray fluorescence 5. outlooks 1 General observations :</p><p>The aim of this experiment was to complete with high resolution element mapping, the petrographic and fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of two stalagmites from the Vercors Massif (SE, France). These two stalagmites (Cho9602 and Be99703) are of great interest for palaeoenvironemental reconstructions. The choice of these two stalagmites had been induced by the global knowledge acquired on these both samples for more than 5 years (U/Th ages, UV emission fluorescence, petrographic characterisation). in our laboratory with the physic laboratory of Lille (Phlam, UMR 8523).</p><p>We have obtained 15 shifts on ID 21 which allow the mapping of low molecular weight (MW) elements like Ca, Mg, Fe.</p><p>The project was too ambitious regarding the first spectrum. In fact, the very low concentrations of elements in the very concentrated calcite (CaCO3) matrix implied generally very long acquisition times which have required moving sample with the piezo electric translation gears. The result of this problem for detection implied to change our project.</p><p>Initially we wanted to scan or map some large part of the sample (about 5 to 10 mm). The time required for each point together with the limits of the sample translation with piezo implied to reduce our will. The time required for testing different sample at the energy of 3.95kev (to avoid the calcium very intense fluorescence) and at 7.2kev to scan the heavier element has spent a large part of our 15 shifts. This experiment is positive :</p><p>• The next project will fit better with the possibility of the ID 21</p><p>• The low concentration of the elements (other that calcium) is interesting regarding publication of X ray fluorescence on stalagmites (e.g. works of S Frisia). The difference of our samples is assumed to be significant of a geological setting. • This first run permits to understand how samples have to be prepared to be analyse by XRF and FTIR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Sample preparation</head><p>We have test different method to take up the preparation of free thin sections of stalagmite with a thickness around 30 µm. We have prepared two free thin section for acquire FTIR and XRF map on a well laminated area around 400 µm *100µm. We didn't have enough time to acquire a well resolved XRF map of this area. We are convinced of the interest of coupling the inorganic high resolution mapping of XRF with the organic and inorganic mapping of FTIR at ID 21.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">FTIR spectroscopy and mapping</head><p>The analyses achieved with FTIR have led to :</p><p>1. The measurement of standard which have to be completed by organic matter standard. The figure below shows different calcite FTIR spectrum. The differencies are linked to the crystallisations : the blue line is a stalagmite natural sample, the red line is a natural thermal calcite crystal and the green line is a CaCO3 powder.</p><p>Position (Micrometers)=-14575 µm ;1021 µm calcite lamelle dominique CaCO3 manu -0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 Absorbance 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Wavenumbers (cm-1)</p><p>2. We present here the example of a the last sample which should be analyse with XRF and FTIR. The image below show the well laminated sample in the left and right part of the red rectangle area.</p><p>The map below shows the OH band of the COOH groups (area profile centered at 3400 cm -1 ). The evolution of organic matter quality is very clear in the laminated part. It is the first time that a such change in the type of organic matter is shown in stalagmite lamination.</p><p>The interest of this map is increased by the following one which seems to correspond to the aromatic characteristic of organic matter (area profile centered at 16200 cm -1 ).</p><p>If this characteristic was confirmed by further studies and analyses, it should indicate that while aromatic (condensed) organic matter supply is quite constant, a more fresh organic matter print the annual organic matter production in soils.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">X ray fluorescence</head><p>Though X ray Fluorescence was the main interest of our experiment, this first run is difficult to use. In fact, maps and spectrum acquired are very noisy and very ambiguous. After processing with the software supplied by the ESRF and with matlab, we can't use these data. The only certainty is that our sample contain calcium but it is not a surprise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">outlooks</head><p>Before to complete the work on FTIR, we hope to acquire an interpretable XRF map for the well laminated sample presented above.</p><p>It is also evident that we need to acquire a better database of humic natural substances and a better knowledge of their relation with calcite.</p><p>These two developments have been proposed in two proposals in march 2006 and should be recombined in one proposal in September 2006.</p></div>		</body>
