<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Aim of the experiment : The aim of this experiment is to perform an ex-situ structural characterization of silicon nanowires (SiNW), grown on a &lt;111&gt; orientated silicon substrate under catalytic conditions. Before the nanowire growth, the catalyst (Gold (Au) was deposed by evaporation, following by a dewetting under high temperature resulsting in a assembly nanometric dropplet. Next, the growth of nanowires onto a silicon substrate by Vapor-Liquid-Solid method under a Chemical-Vapor-Deposition mode, lead an assembly of crystalline silicon nanowires which much ne investigated. This is supposed to yield important knowledge about the growth characteristics like epitaxial and crystalline properties, lattice parameter, strain, defects and shape/faceting of the SiNW.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measurements :</head><p>We have performed the lattice mismatch parameter measurements between (SiNW) and the silicon substrate.</p><p>The selected energy was E = 11.4 keV corresponding to a wavelength λ = 0.108758 nm. The experimental set-up was a 7-circles goniometer, and the detector was a punctual NaI scintillator. Three samples were investigated of three different length L: short (S), medium (M), long (L) wires <ref type="bibr">(resp. L = 350, 1177, 2782nm)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results :</head><p>We have performed Grazing Incident X Ray Diffraction (GIXD) measurements. Typical profiles of diffraction are shown on Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The diffracted intensity is plotted versus the scattering vector q along the in-plane direction &lt;300&gt; (of the hexagonal system) for the &lt;111&gt; oriented silicon wafer. The profile reveals a narrow peak (Sub) coming from the diffraction by the silicon substrate, and also a broader one (SiNW) which is attributed to the Bragg's diffraction of the silicon nanowires. This observation gives evidence of the crystalline character of the wires, and also of their epitaxy with the silicon substrate. Even if the peak is broader than the substrate, it is relatively narrow and well defined. There is only a small mosaicity in the wires and only a very few defects. Both peaks (SiNW) and (Sub) have different q values. In consequence there is a lattice mismatch parameter ∆a/a between the silicon wafer and the silicon nanowires (defined by: ∆a/a = (a SiNW -a Sub )/a Sub , where a SiNW and a Sub are the lattice parameter of the silicon nanowires and of the substrate respectively). As we see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, q SiNW &lt; q Sub , which evidences that ∆a/a &gt;0. We present in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> results of profiles of diffraction by varying the incident angle close to the critical angle α c . For short wires (S) and for α i close to 0°, we observe only one peak (SiNW). As the angle of incidence α i increases, a narrow peak of diffraction appears at the right of the (SiNW) peak. For α i = α c this narrow peak become very intense, and then we attribute this peak to the diffraction of the x-ray beam by the silicon substrate. As the wires are very short, when α i increases, the cross section of the beam with the sample decreases and the intensity of (SiNW) decreases, also observed for α i &gt; α c (Figure <ref type="figure">1 (b)</ref>). For long wires (L), Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (c) shows similarly behaviour. We present in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> the evolution of the in-plane lattice mismatch parameter ∆a/a versus the length of nanowires along the radial &lt;300&gt; direction (full circles). The inplane ∆a/a is positive corresponding to a small expansion of the crystalline lattice of SiNW. As it can be seen the ∆a/a is close to +5.2×10 -4 when the length of the wires L &gt; 1000 nm, while for shorter nanowires ∆a/a ≈ +3.4×10 -4 . The ∆a/a along the in-plane perpendicular direction was also measured and is reported by full triangles. Consequently the expansion is similar and the strain is symmetrical in agreement with the symmetrical character of the cylindrical wires.</p><p>0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 56.6 56.65 56.7 56.75 56.8 56.85 q (nm -1 ) Intensity (ct/s) 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 56.6 56.65 56.7 56.75 56.8 56.85 q (nm -1 ) Intensity (cts/s) 0 50000 100000 150000 200000 250000 56.6 56.65 56.7 56.75 56.8 q (nm -1 ) Intensity (ct/s) 0 50000 100000 150000 200000 250000 300000 56.6 56.65 56.7 56.75 56.8 56.85 q (nm -1 ) Intensity (Cts/s) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 L (nm) ∆ ∆ ∆ ∆a/a (10 -4</p><p>) </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(S) (M) (L) (a) (b) (c) (d) (Sub) (SiNW) (SiNW) (SiNW) (SiNW) (Sub) (Sub) (Sub) α α α α i &lt; α α α α c α α α α i &gt; α α α α c</formula></div>

The presence of gold (Au) could explained this expansion and will be investigated in a further experiment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure2</figDesc></figure>
