<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to study the microscopic structure of the newly discovered hidden (H) quantum state of 1T-TaS2 by means of elastic X-ray diffraction XRD. Electrical resistivity and optical reflectivity measurements revealed that in thin single crystals of 1T-TaS2 ultra-short laser pulses induce a semiconductor-to-metal transition into a new metastable charge density wave (CDW) phase <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Up to now the microscopic structure of this new laser-induced CDW remains widely elusive. Hence, our goal was to employ XRD in order to determine the modulation wave vector (q-vector), the correlation length and amplitude of the hidden CDW state. Thin films with a thickness of about 50 nm and typical lateral dimensions of up to 100 μm were prepared by mechanical exfoliation from high-quality 1T-TaS2 bulk single crystals. In order to optically pump the sample and subsequently probe their microscopic CDW structure, the exfoliated flakes were deposited on 200 nm thick Si3N4 membranes spanning a 1x1 mm 2 hole in a silicon wafer. The silicon wafer was clued on a sample holder, which was mounted on the coldfinger of a tailor-made continuous He-flow cryostat. The cryostat was attached to an one-circle goniometer. Following a quick assessment of the crystal quality at room temperature we cooled the samples down to 4K.</p><p>In order to induce the H-state the 1T-TaS2 flakes were photo-excited with a 1.6 ps pump pulse from a Tisapphire laser with a wavelength of 800 nm. The laser beam had a diameter of 400 μm (FWHM). The CDW structure of the persistent photo-induced state was then studied by means of XRD. To this end, the sample was exposed to a 60x100 μm 2 X-ray beam with a photon energy of 18 keV. Single crystal datasets consisting of 120 frames measured over a sample rotation of 60 degree were collected using a Rayonix MX170 detector. We used four different pulse fluencies F1,2,3,4 = 0.04, 0.09, 0.24, 0.60 mJ/cm 2 and studied two different samples.</p><p>In addition, we conducted XRD at ID27, in order to investigate the relationship between the H-state and the structurally closely related supercooled nearly commensurate (NC)-CDW state <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</p><p>Most importantly, our work shows that the photo-induced transition into the H-state is associated with a marked change of the CDW stacking, as shown in the Figure . The stacking of the CDW in the hidden state is similar to the stacking found in the room temperature NC-CDW phase and the super cooled NC-CDW phase.</p><p>Apart from the CDW layer stacking also the in-plane structure changes upon entering the H-state in a way that discommensurations form which yields a change of the in-plane q-vector and the appearance of higher order reflections. These results strongly suggest that the H-state is very similar to the supercooled NC-CDW. However, details of the discommensurations lattice differ for all three NC-CDW phases, and may thus explain different physical properties observed so far. (c) and (f) Keeping T at 4 K and inducing a 1.6 ps laser pulse at 800 nm, the H-phase is reached. The strong higher order peaks (c) and the sharp single peak along l (f), indicates that the electronic order in the H-phase is similar to the order in the NC-phase.</p><p>[1] L. <ref type="bibr">Stojchevska et al., Science 344, 177 (2014)</ref> [2] M. <ref type="bibr">Yoshida et al., Scientific Reports 4, 7302 (2014)</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure :</head><label>:</label><figDesc>Figure:Reciprocal space maps of the XRD intensitsy for the NC phase (a), the C phase (b), and the photoinduced H phase (c), within a slice of thickness Δl = 2/3 onto the hexagonal hk0 plane. The corresponding reciprocal-lattice region, along the modulation vector q and perpendicular to the hk0 plane is illustrated in (d), (e) and (f). In all images the Bragg reflections are indicated by the Miller indices (hkl), and the axes of the reciprocal coordinate system, are shown by black arrows. (a) and (d) At room temperature 1T-TaS2 exhibits a NC-CDW, with strong higher order peaks, arising from a domain like structure with sharp boundaries. Furthermore, the point-like satellite peak in (d), indicates a well-ordered stacking along l. In addition (c) and (e) illustrates the C-CDW order at 4K, characterized by broad peaks due to the presence of disordered stacking along l. (c) and (f) Keeping T at 4 K and inducing a 1.6 ps laser pulse at 800 nm, the H-phase is reached. The strong higher order peaks (c) and the sharp single peak along l (f), indicates that the electronic order in the H-phase is similar to the order in the NC-phase.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,44.04,164.28,504.24,362.88" type="bitmap" /></figure>
