<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Summary</head><p>With the aim of understanding a complex structural arrangement involving STAM2-AMSH-Ubiquitin, which play key roles during lysosomal degradation pathway, we have obtained our first SAXS measurements in Nov.</p><p>2016. During the course of our beamtime we have managed to measure different protein constructs and complexes (STAM2 UIM-SH3 &amp; VHS-UIM-SH3; AMSH; STAM2-AMSH) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) at various concentration ranges under different buffer and additive conditions. 30 samples were measured in total. In terms of sample quality, STAM2 proteins (UIM-SH3 in particular) showed curves with good signal / noise within the q range between 0.007 and 0.494 Å -1 at concentrations ranging between 1 and 12 mg / ml. Strong interparticle efects were not evident and the final scattering curve was obtained by merging the curves from the lowest and the highest concentrations which was then used for further analysis. At the conclusion of our initial data analysis for STAM2, the SAXS data complements our recently published NMR data <ref type="bibr">(Hologne et al., 2016)</ref> and moreover it opens up new prospects for our next beamtime which we are planning for in the upcomming months. On the other hand, despite our effors to ensure monodispersity and homogeneity for all our samples, one of our samples (AMSH) was severely aggregated even at a concentration as low as 0.1 mg / ml. This is expected of such protein with flexibility at its extremity. New efforts have been made to express, purify and optimise a full-length AMSH (FL-AMSH), evidence of which will be implemented in our next proposal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary Results &amp; upcoming plans</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the processed SAXS curves for UIM-SH3 in gray and VHS-UIM-SH3 in red, which were fit against each of the theoretical scattering curves in orange and black solid lines for UIM-SH3 and VHS-UIM- SH3 respectively.</p></div>

(above right) Graphical representation of the pool of random structures, best ensemble, as well as the best and worst single structure for UIM-SH3. (below left) Size distribution of UIM-SH3 (orange) and VHS-UIM-SH3 (black).</head><p>Given the flexibility of STAM2, EOM (Ensemble Optimisation Method) <ref type="bibr">(Tria et al., 2015)</ref> was used to obtain the best ensemble structures from which the average theoretical curves were calculated. Quality of the experimental data, linearity of the Guinier plot, and model fiting by c 2 minimisation were of good standard (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Nevertheless, further improvement in sample quality and model precision is being implemented for our next proposal. The data was analysed by SASSIE (<ref type="url" target="http://www.smallangles.net/sassie/SASSIE_HOME.html">http://www.smallangles.net/sassie/SASSIE_HOME.html</ref>) in parallel which also resulted in a similar preliminary outcome as the EOM. AMSH, known for its unstability showed strong signs of aggregation/oligomerisation during our last beamtime. Since then, fresh efforts have been made to improve this by expressing and purifying a new full length (FL) AMSH in its monodisperse form which we are planning to measure in our next available beamtime as well as the STAM2-AMSH FL complex. Ubiquitin in monomeric and/or trimeric forms are also in preparation which will be measured in complex with STAM2 (and AMSH). Conformational changes which may occur upon these interactions and whether the overall shape and size of the complex agree with (or not?) our proposed model system will be of our utmost interest in our next experiment at BM29.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
