<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The purpose of this proposal was to study the pressure-induced spin transition of iron silicate perovskite (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al)O3. We expected to be able to measure the XMCD signal of the k-edge of Fe at low temperature and various pressures. We started out at ambient pressure conditions for obtaining a reference for the XMCD signal of the high-spin state. However, even without a diamond-anvil cell which would greatly decrease the signal due to the low transmission of ~7 keV x-rays through diamond, we were unable to obtain a reasonable signal, even after several hours of collection time. There were a few factors which contributed to the difficulties we faced: 1) The sample has a low Fe content (synthesized using 20% FeO), which results in a small absorption yield. 2) Samples were synthesized using a multi-anvil press, resulting in non-uniform and non-flat grains of about 20-30 m in each direction (with X-ray beam diameter 30 m). 3) Stability issues on the beamline which resulted in the beam drifting off the sample area during the measurement. Measuring the XMCD signal relies on subtracting the resulting differences of two opposing field directions between two XANES spectra of opposite polarizations, and, therefore, drift of the x-ray beam on the sample was producing a considerable undesirable effect on the measured signal and, thus, affecting repeatability and quality of the final data.</p><p>The beamline staff minimized the stabilization issues to the best extent possible, by removing any mechanical vibrations from the stages of the cryostat and the x-ray optics, by automatically scanning for the sample center every few short measurements, and by running each measurement multiple times for averaging. This still proved to be insufficient for the iron silicate perovskite sample, and it seems that the solution would be to use a pelletized sample, produced by pressing multiple grains recovered from the multi-anvil synthesis into a pellet of ~100 m diameter and ~50 m uniform thickness.</p><p>In order to utilize the time for measuring the XMCD of Fe at high-pressure conditions, we decided to eventually measure an iron rich sample Fe7C3. This sample is ferromagnetic at ambient conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Tsuzuki et al. 1984)</ref> and is claimed to undergo two pressure-induced magnetic transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Chen et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2014)</ref>, at around 7 and 53 GPa.</p><p>Our Fe7C3 samples were also recovered from a multi-anvil synthesis, and are therefore 20-30 m in each direction. However, due to the high Fe content and due to the optimization efforts of the local contact we were able to obtain spectra with a reasonable signal at 6 GPa (295 K) and at 35 GPa (2 K) (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The collection time for each spectrum was ~24 hours. We used local ESRF non-magnetic membrane cells, in the transmission mode. Pressure was measured offline using ruby fluorescence. Magnetic fields of ±1.5 T were used to measure the XMCD signal.</p><p>At 6 GPa we performed two runs, with the only difference being that in the 2 nd run we optimized the sample position relative to the x-ray beam every few measurements. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows that this resulted in a spectrum of significantly higher quality, with a much better signal to noise ratio. We can also see that the XMCD signal at 6 GPa is very similar to our ambient pressure measurement. This is expected and goes well with observations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chen et al. (2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2014)</ref>. At 35 GPa and 2 K we still observe an XMCD signal at the same energy range, although with a lower intensity. This XMCD signal proves that the Fe still has a magnetic moment, and that the previously reported transition at room temperature high pressure conditions transforms Fe7C3 into a paramagnetic state with an ordering temperature below room temperature. 7100 7110 7120 7130 7140 -0.0025 -0.0020 -0.0015 -0.0010 -0.0005 0.0000 0.0005 0.0010 0 GPa -Pellet 0 GPa XMCD Energy Figure 2: XMCD of Fe7C3 at 0 GPa (RT) collected in transmission mode (blue) and in total fluorescnece yield in back scattering geometry (black).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Determination of spin-state of Fe in (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al)O3 at high pressures up to 130 GPa using HP-LT XMCD</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Another issue we faced was 'glitches' due to the diamond (spectral artifacts occurring due to strong diamond anvil diffraction). These artifacts affected a large energy range of the collected data at high pressure. We made several attempts to improve this situation (DAC rotation), but the glitches were not completely removed. Although the glitches were less of an issue at ambient pressure, at pressure of 35 GPa we had a strong parasitic signal from them affecting our signal in the energy range of our interest.</p><p>Further improvements to be made in future experiments include: 1) Collecting the data in the total fluorescence yield in back scattering geometry will help to avoid problems related to the sample surface and variations in effective thickness (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). 2) Using a partially perforated anvil will diminish effect of 'glitches'. In the current run we were unable to do this, as our perforated anvils are not of the Boehler-Almax design required for the membrane cell provided by ESRF. Special diamond anvils need to be purchased for this purpose. 3) Pelletizing multiple grains of the recovered sample for the high-pressure experiments will minimize the effects due to instability.</p></div>			</div>
