<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The purpose of the experiment was to perform a statistical study of the microstructure of gold nanocrystals before and after nanoindentation. We used the high throughput of ID01 for Coherent X-ray Diffraction (CXD) measurements and of the nanoindentation facility of our lab, also based in Grenoble, to measure a large number of crystals by CXD before and after ex situ nanoindentation, during the same experimental run.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experiment went almost as initially planned and was very successful.</p><p>The gold nanocrystals were prepared by solid state dewetting of a gold thin film on a sapphire substrate. The substrates were covered with a patterned mask in order to obtain well isolated crystals aligned on a square lattice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The large separation is needed for the CXD measurements because the focused beam has weak but large tails that can cause the measurement to fail by illuminating nearby crystals. The template is used to identify the crystals individually during the nanoindentation and the CXD measurements. SEM prior to the experiment allowed do identified the best crystals, i.e. the ones that display a shape as close as possible to the Winterbottom equilibrium shape. This characteristic is important to ease the modelling, and allows to select a set of crystals with external shapes as similar as possible, in order to make statistics.</p><p>We prepared 2 substrates hosting slightly different types of crystals: they were obtained by dewetting films of different thickness (45 nm and 60 nm), leading to nanocrystals with slightly different average sizes. The influence of the size on the mechanical behaviour is an open debate in the community.</p><p>As initially planned, a large number of crystals on both substrates were sequentially measured in their initial state, then indented in our lab, then measured again at ID01. The full list of crystals is given in appendix. The beamtime was fully used, by measuring one of the samples while indenting the other one. In addition, due to the larger through-put of CXD than nano-indentation, a large number of crystals were measured only by CXD, for future investigation of their mechanical response: the initial microstructure is relevant to understand it. Characterisation of the final microstructure, if needed, can be done later (beamtime will be required).</p><p>Different parameters of indentation were used. Some crystals were loaded with a "flat punch" and others were properly indented with a "cube corner" tip (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In all cases, the load-displacement curves, which characterize globally the mechanical test, were recorded, and the crystals were loaded/indented at various load levels and depths. The CXD experiment was performed with the standard set-up, i.e. at 8 keV with Fresnel Zone Plate focusing (the sample was placed 1 mm out of focus in order to match the beam size with the crystals size). The vicinity of the 111 Bragg reflection was measured in 3D by rocking the sample and recording the diffraction pattern with the Maxipix4 detector. Sufficient oversampling in the 3 dimensions was ensured by the detector to sample distance (~1m) and the rocking curve step size (0.005°).</p><p>We intend to recover real space images of the crystals by using phase retrieval algorithms. The phase of the real space reconstruction provides an image of lattice displacement field, from which the strain and the crystal defects can de deduced. The analysis is in progress, but will take time due to the large amount of data and the poor automation of the "reconstruction" process. In cases when the real space reconstruction fails, a reciprocal space analysis can already provide qualitative information on the microstructure of the crystal, before and after indentation. We provide below an example of data with its real space reconstruction, for a crystal which has been loaded by a flat punch. The force-displacement curve suggests a reversible (elastic) load (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), but the diffraction data proves that the load induced stacking faults in the {111} planes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) that were not detected by the nanoindenter. This example demonstrates the high sensitivity of CXD to crystal defects, to a level that even top-of-the-art mechanical apparatus cannot challenge.  0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Load (mN) Depth (nm) While the analysis is still in progress, we can already draw the following general conclusions:</p><p>• We established a reliable procedure to investigate the effect of mechanical loading on the microstructure of nanocrystals. • The method is high throughput, because both techniques (CDI and nanoindentation) are high throughput and both located in Grenoble.</p><p>• The large number of crystals measured in this run will provide interesting mechanical information, but probably deserve more measurements in order to improve the statistical validity of study.</p></div>
