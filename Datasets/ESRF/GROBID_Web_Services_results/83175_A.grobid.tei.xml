<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The selective oxidation of propylene towards acrolein is an important reaction in the chemical industry, since acrolein is a precursor for large scale production of the amino acid methionine or acrylic acid as polymer buidling unit. Catalysts used for this process are based on bismuth molybdates [1]. Depending on the ratio of Bi/Mo, three bismuth molybdate phases may occur: γ-Bi 2 MoO 6 , β-Bi 2 Mo 2 O 9 and α-Bi 2 Mo 3 O 12 . However, there is an ongoing discussion about the stability and activity of the three phases under working conditions. In our group, we have recently found that the preparation method, including co-precipitation, hydrothermal synthesis and flame spray pyrolysis, significantly effects the catalysts performance [2-3]. Furthermore, there is a strong debate about the redox-role of molybdenum and bismuth within the mechanistic cylce and their reducibility. In order to reveal the working properties of bismuth molybdates, in situ and operando X-ray spectroscopy present a valuable tool and have not been performed on such systems. XAS is especially suitable since it is sensitive to amorphous intermediates and to the very local order. However, for a valid interpretation, a combination with XRD, which gives information on the crystalline bismuth molybdate phases, is crucial and accessible at BM31. Originally, we intended to further combine XAS and XRD with Raman spectroscopy. Unfortunately, the Raman spectrometer is not available at BM31 like it was in former times at BM01B. Thus, the proposed experiment had three objectives: (1) to probe the reducibility of molybdenum and bismuth by performing temperature-programmed reduction experiments in a helium/propylene atmosphere, (2) to study the stability of phases under various conditions and (3) to compare the properties of the highly active β-Bi 2 Mo 2 O 9 prepared by different methods. Samples of γ-Bi 2 MoO 6 , β-Bi 2 Mo 2 O 9 and α-Bi 2 Mo 3 O 12 were prepared by flame-spray pyrolysis and hydrothermal synthesis. For operando studies, they were filled in capillary reactors, availible at BM31. By using a gas blower, the capillaries with the catalyst material could be heated and helium, oxygen, water, and propylene could be dosed via a gas distribution system brought from KIT.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The fast edge changing possibilities at BM31 allowed us to measure XAS at Mo K and Bi L 3 edges almost simultaneously. Thus, temperature programmed reduction in propylene/helium atmosphere allowed us to study the reduction behavior of bismuth and molybdenum in the same heating cycle. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, α-Bi 2 Mo 3 O 12 shows reduction of both molybdenum (Mo 6+  Mo 4+ ) and bismuth (Bi 3+  Bi 0 ), whereas molybdenum is getting reduced at ca. 30 K lower temperature. This indicates an easier reduction of molybdenum, which is in line with the proposed mechanistic behavior by <ref type="bibr">Zhai et al. [4]</ref>. Similar experiments have been conducted for other bismuth molybdate phases showing versatile results. Under TPR and oxidative conditions, we observed phase transformations by both XAS and XRD. Their extend depended on the synthesis method and type of bismuth molybdate phase. Thus, their reactive stability depends on both. For instance, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, γ-Bi 2 MoO 6 tranformed after the TPR to its high temperature form. Under reducing conditions, only MoO 2 reflections are present, which is in line with XAS results. In general, β-Bi 2 Mo 2 O 9 was more stable under working conditions than other phases. Only a combination of XAS and XRD allowed to evaluate the results and assign the changes e.g. in molybdenum coordination to a distinct crystalline phase. In the present study, we could successfully combine XRD and XAS to study the behavior of various bismuth molybdates in propylene oxidation. For the first time, we were able to unravel the redox-role of the specific elements under realistic conditions and gain insight on the phase stability. A detailed discussion of the obtained results is underway <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.</p></div>
