<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Coupled transport-reaction numerical simulations are essential to model large-scale processes over long durations. However, in the case of CO 2 underground storage, few experimental data exist allowing us to constrain and validate the various assumptions implemented in these models. In particular, little is known about the (irreversible) modifications of reservoir properties in the highly reactive systems resulting from massive CO 2 injection. A set of four reactive flow-trough experiments at temperature T = 100 °C and total pressure P = 12 MPa are performed using limestone reservoir samples. The objectives are to quantify mass transfers occurring (1) near the injection well, where the aquifer fluid is almost saturated with CO 2 (i.e. 2 CO P ≈ P), and (2) at increasing distances from the injection well, where the fluid is expected to display lower 2 CO P values and higher divalent cation concentrations resulting from rock dissolution along the fluid pathway. 2 The results for 2 CO P of 10 MPa and 6 MPa predict non-uniform dissolution features associated with transport-controlled mass transfer near the injection well, while kineticallycontrolled uniform dissolution is observed at lower 2 CO P (2.5 MPa). Furthermore, the scaling laws relating porosity to permeability are distinctly different between experiments. As a result, macroscale porosity-permeability relationships should be parameterized not only to account for rock-type-dependent properties, as is generally the case when modelling low reactivity systems, but also to take account of the local dissolution regime. Therefore, we define a reference macroscopic Damköhler number ( * Da = 1) corresponding to the kinetically-controlled dissolution conditions observed at 2 CO P = 2.5 MPa. Then, the value of Da &gt; 1 characterizing the transport-controlled dissolution is given by the ratio between the calcium production (normalized to the sample-size) obtained in experiments at 2 CO P &gt; 2.5 MPa and at 2 CO P = 2.5 MPa. We propose a Damköhler-dependent relationship between porosity and permeability: n c k ) ( ~φ φ -</p><p>, where c φ is the porosity at the percolation threshold and n a power law of Da. As Da is defined only from macroscopic measurable parameters (i.e. calcium concentration in the case of calcite dissolution), the proposed k -φ - Da law can be easily implemented in reservoir-scale numerical simulations. Finally, for the experiment at 2 CO P = 0.7, i.e. reproducing conditions far from the injection well, we observe a uniform decrease of the porosity associated with dolomitization of the reservoir. However, the rate of permeability decrease is not constant but grows strongly as the porosity approaches c φ , indicating a probable clogging of the medium if dolomitization conditions persist.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>CO 2 sequestration in geological formations is increasingly being studied as a workable way of limiting the overload of CO 2 emissions in the atmosphere. CO 2 disposal into geological formations includes mainly deep-saline aquifers and depleted oil reservoirs, which represent storage capacities estimated around 10 13 kg and 4 x 10 11 kg, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Holloway, 1997)</ref>. The process consists in injecting supercritical more-or-less-pure CO 2 into the formation porosity through boreholes, following the same procedure routinely performed by the petroleum industry for enhancing oil recovery. Here, we focus on carbonate-rich rocks which are widely present in sedimentary reservoirs.</p><p>Whatever the rock composition, the progressive dissolution of CO 2 in the formation water (generally at thermodynamic equilibrium with the rock-forming minerals) leads to a decrease in its pH. As a result, there is a significant increase in the dissolution capacity of the CO 2 -rich fluid and the main expected processes involve dissolution of carbonates and, eventually, the (alumino)silicates, depending on the kinetics of the individual reactions see reviews in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Plummer et al. (1978)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lasaga (1981)</ref>. Near the injection well, where disequilibrium is maximal, dissolution processes are expected to affect (irreversibly) the mechanical and hydrodynamic properties of the host rock. Specifically, dissolution will lead to an increase in porosity and permeability as well as changes in the reactive surface. For a constant injection rate, the penetration distance of the dissolution front will be a complex function of all these time-and space-resolved modifications. Conversely, the increase of cation concentration produced by the carbonate dissolution will eventually produce supersaturated fluids with respect to carbonate minerals at the outermost front of the CO 2 -rich plume. We would expect precipitation processes and then decreasing porosity and permeability.</p><p>Several experimental and theoretical studies have analysed the geochemical reactions between reservoir rocks and injected carbon dioxide. Most of these studies investigated the mass 4 transfers of calcite, dolomite and magnesite, in contact with acid solutions at low CO 2 partial pressures (i.e. P CO2 &lt; 0.1 MPa and room temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lund et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Plummer et al., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chou et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Compton and Unwin, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dreybrodt et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Arvidson et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Noiriel et al., 2005)</ref>. Others studies have focused on measuring calcite and dolomite dissolution rates at P CO2 &gt; 0.1 MPa and/or moderate temperature (≤ 80°C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alkattan et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gautelier et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pokrovsky et al., 1999b)</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Pokrovsky et al. (2005)</ref> measured the dissolution rates of calcite, dolomite and magnesite as a function of P CO2 (P CO2 ≤ 8 MPa), at moderate NaCl concentration (0.01 to 1.0 M) and pH ≤ 4. However, only few experimental studies have been published for P-T-P CO2 conditions corresponding to the anticipated in situ conditions during injection, i.e. T = 80-150 °C and P = 9 -20 MPa. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kaszuba et al. (2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kaszuba et al. ( , 2005) )</ref> carried out dissolution/precipitation experiments at high temperature T = 200 °C and high pressure (P = 20 MPa) in a closed reactor using powdered rocks. These results are fundamental for understanding reaction paths and quantifying mass transfers in response to high P CO2 fluids. Nevertheless, to quantify the long-lasting presence of huge volumes of CO 2 in reservoirs, we need to address the essential issue of feedback effects due to mass transfer, which can modify the pore structure and the hydrodynamic properties of the reservoir. Fluid-rock mass transfers depend on several parameters (P CO2 , cation concentrations, flow rate or pressure head at the boundaries, reactive surface areas, porosity, permeability, tortuosity, etc). The behaviour of these coupled processes is unpredictable without the help of numerical modelling. However, a key difficulty remains the large variability of the characteristic scales and times of the hydrodynamic and chemical processes. Specifically, fluid flow and hydrodynamic transport are controlled by large-scale characteristics of the porous media (e.g. long-range correlation of the permeability field and boundary conditions), whereas chemical reactions are controlled by local parameters at the fluid mineral interfaces. Consequently, physics-based laws relating microscopic volume changes to macroscopic changes in permeability are only available for very simple models of homogeneous porous media (i.e. stacked spheres). Otherwise, we need to make use of heuristic laws that simultaneously lump together and upscale all the processes relating mass transfer to hydrodynamic properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Wong et al., 1984)</ref>. At present, i.e. 70 years after the pioneering work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kozeny (1927)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Carman (1937)</ref>, most numerical models use power law permeability / porosity scaling for the reservoir to predict permeability changes triggered by fluid-rock mass transfers.</p><p>In carbonate-rich reservoirs, both the pore structure and the macro-scale distribution of the transport properties are complex as a result of many successive diagenetic events, whereas the chemical composition of the rock may be relatively simple. For highly reactive fluids such as high P CO2 fluids, coupled flow and dissolution processes may induce the formation of highly conductive and spatially correlated flow channels, often termed wormholes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fredd, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Wormholes grow because of the natural heterogeneity of the porous medium and the relatively fast dissolution of the carbonate phase under low pH conditions. Evidently, general laws relating permeability (k) to porosity (φ) cannot account for changes in the spatial correlation of properties such as observed in the presence of wormholes.</p><p>This study aims to provide experimental data that can be used to constrain the modelling of CO 2 injection and sequestration, and specifically the permeability / porosity scaling law. We present a set of reactive percolation experiments carried out at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) typical of in situ conditions. Experiments are designed to quantify reactions occurring near the CO 2 injection zone, where the aquifer fluid is saturated with CO 2 . In addition, experiments were carried out at increasing distances from the injection point, where the fluid is expected to contain progressively less CO 2 and more divalent cations resulting from rock dissolution along the fluid pathway. The underlying idea is to obtain experimental control-points in space and time corresponding to the transport of CO 2 in the reservoir during the injection phase, 6 whereas a complete and continuous reproduction of these processes is clearly not feasible at the laboratory scale. The experimental protocol allows us to study the feedback between changes in porosity, permeability and rock structure induced by the mass transfer of rockforming minerals due to reactive fluid percolation in the rock. The methodology combines chemical analysis of the fluid, continuous measurements of sample permeability and porescale characterization of the rock before and after each experiment using X-rays microtomography (XMT) 3D imaging.</p><p>Finally, the dataset are used to establish the dependence of the φ -k relationship on the CO 2 partial pressure and disequilibrium state of the fluid.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Experimental approach</head><p>The experiments consisted of injecting CO 2 -enriched fluid through a cylindrical sample core of 9 mm diameter (D) and 18 mm length (L). The four percolation experiments were carried out under in situ sequestration conditions (T = 100 °C and P = 12 MPa), using various partial pressures of CO 2 and different ion concentrations in rock-equilibrated fluids (brine) to simulate CO 2 -saturated brine transport during the injection phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">1</ref>). Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> presents the composition of the different fluids used in the four flow-through experiments. The geochemical code CHESS (van der Lee, 2002) was used to determine the pH of the injected CO 2 -enriched fluids for different fixed P CO2 conditions and values of saturation index. The CO 2 -enriched fluid was injected at constant flow rate, corresponding to Q = 1.9 × 10 -8 m 3 .s -1 for the three first experiments and Q = 1.0 × 10 -8 m 3 .s -1 for the fourth experiment. The first three experiments were performed at the same flow rate because we assumed these conditions represent processes in the vicinity of the injection well, whereas experiment 4 was performed at lower flow rate to mimic flow rate far away from the injection well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">The percolation apparatus</head><p>A new experimental device (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">2</ref>) was specifically engineered to reproduce in situ massive CO 2 injection in reservoir samples at the laboratory scale for temperatures ranging from 50 to 200 °C, reservoir static pressures of 7 to 20 MPa and a partial pressure of CO 2 increasing up to the static pressure. Resident fluids are generally moderate to high salinity brines, almost or completely equilibrated with the rock-forming minerals prio to the CO 2 injection. The experimental apparatus described below allows us to study systematically the processes for any combination of these parameters.</p><p>The five main specific components of the device are described below: 1) a motorized dualpiston pump system that produces the flow of reservoir brine, 2) a motorized piston pump containing liquid-phase CO 2 cooled at 5°C, 3) the CO 2 -brine mixing system, 4) the percolation cell holding the sample, and 5) the back-pressure controller / sampling system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">2</ref>).</p><p>The two motorized piston pumps are equipped with displacement encoders, which allow an accurate control of the flow rate. This motorized dual pump system is operated to obtain a continuous brine flow rate ranging from 2.10 -9 to 2.5.10 -8 m 3 .s -1 . The piston pump motion and the pneumatically-controlled valves are operated by a LabView-based software.</p><p>It is difficult to control the volume ratio of a two-phase fluid mixture (i.e. liquid brine and supercritical CO 2 ). To avoid this obstacle, the mixing of the brine with CO 2 is carried out at high pressure (6 to 20 MPa) but low temperature (i.e. 5 °C). Under these conditions, CO 2 is in the liquid state, which allows us to set the brine/CO 2 volume ratio corresponding to the desired CO 2 saturation of the fluid, while at the same time controlling the mixture flow rate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">3</ref>). To summarize, CO 2 and brine are first mixed in a cooled coil (e.g. maintained at 5 °C) and then heated up to the target temperature in an oven-coated coil.</p><p>In the percolation cell, both axial and radial confining pressures are applied to the sample. To mimic natural confinement conditions, it is essential to apply a controlled confining pressure and balance the fluid injection to avoid deviatoric stresses that may damage the sample irreversibly. The axial confining pressure is applied by the axial piston, whereas the radial confining pressure is obtained by pressurization of the silicon jacket covering the sample. In our experiments, axial and radial pressures are maintained equal, at 112 % of the inlet pressure whatever its value. Therefore, we can avoid damaging the rock throughout the duration of the experiment. This system is essential to minimize stresses on the sample during pressure and temperature loading and unloading at the beginning and the end of the experiment, respectively. To achieve this objective, we make use of a pressure multiplier with a free-moving piston of dissymmetric diameter.</p><p>The minimal pressure required to avoid degassing of the CO 2 in the circuit is controlled by a back-pressure system that imposes a constant pressure drop whatever the flow rate. This control may become critical at low flow rates. Under such conditions, manual control is required using a micrometric valve to reduce the fluctuations to less than about 3%. These fluctuations have no impact on the permeability measurements because flow rate is in a steady state, storage is low and the pressure drop is measured continuously by a high-resolution differential pressure transducer.</p><p>The available flow rate (2.10 -9 ≤ Q ≤ 2.5.10 -8 m 3 .s -1 ) enables the exploration of a wide range of hydrodynamic conditions. Specifically, this equipment allows us to explore the entire range of fluid-rock interactions (dissolution and/or precipitation) from fully kinetically-controlled to fully transport-controlled mass transfer processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sample characterization</head><p>The samples studied here are oolitic limestones from the Mondeville formation of Middle Jurassic age (Paris Basin). The rock is essentially composed of recrystallized ooliths with a mean diameter of less than a few hundred of µm, partially cemented with micritic calcite.</p><p>All the samples were analysed and compared by XMT, XRD (X-Ray Diffraction), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and cathodoluminescence techniques, to check that samples cored alongside each other are chemically and physically similar. Sample volumes contain thousands of pores and can be regarded as a representative elementary volume (REV) of rock <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(de Marsily, 1981)</ref>. While heterogeneities larger than the sample size are clearly not included in this REV, the experimental results can be easily upscaled to the reservoir scale in terms of matrix properties. Cathodoluminescence and SEM analyses of the four samples show no measurable differences of chemical or structural composition. Additional analyses on whole rocks give the similar composition of the four studied samples, which corresponds to a magnesium-calcite of formula Ca α Mg β CO 3 with α = 0.99 and β = 0.01. The initial porosity of samples calculated from post-processing the XMT images <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Noiriel et al., 2005)</ref> are similar in the case of 3 samples (φ = 7.5 ± 0.2) and slightly lower (φ = 6.8) in the case of 1 sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Monitoring changes in porosity and permeability</head><p>Sample-scale changes in permeability k(t) are measured by measuring the pressure drop ∆P between the inlet and the outlet of the sample. According to Darcy's law, the ratio of the volumetric flow rate Q [m 3 .s -1 ] to the pressure difference ∆P (Pa) scales linearly with the sample permeability k [m 2 ]:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">, P S Q L µ k ∆ - = (1)</formula><p>where L is the length of the sample in the flow direction [m], S is the cross-sectional area of the sample [m²] and µ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid [Pa.s].</p><p>The fluid is collected repeatedly from the outlet port, and then analysed for Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ concentrations using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES). The volume of dissolved calcite (V CaCO3 (t)) is as follows: φ is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">τ τ β τ α υ τ d C C Q t V t CaCO CaCO ) ( ) ( ) ( Mg 0 Ca 3 3 ∆ + ∆ = ∫ = ,<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">t t V V t t CaCO ∂ ∂ = ∂ ∂ ) ( 1 ) ( 3 φ , (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">V is the total sample volume (i.e. 4 / 2 LD V π =</formula><p>). To integrate equation (3), we need to know the porosity at a given time t using, for instance, the XMT images. The procedure is presented below in section 3.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">X-Ray Computed Micro-Tomography (XMT)</head><p>Before and after each experiment, rock samples were scanned by X-ray Computed Micro-Tomography (XMT) to characterize the pore-space geometry. The XMT technique is an unmatched tool for producing nondestructive three-dimensional images of rocks without any prior preparation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Flannery et al., 1987)</ref>. In the present study, data acquisition was performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (France) using the ID19 beam-line. The principle of XMT is based on the 3D computed reconstruction of an object partially absorbent to X-rays, using a set of 2D detector readings acquired at different angular positions. A total of 1 500 x-ray readings were recorded, using an exposure time of 2 s at each angle and a rotational interval of 0.12 degree along the core axis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">4</ref>).</p><p>For each X-ray reading, the monochromatic X-ray beam passes through the sample and then reaches the scintillator, which converts it into visible light recorded by a high-speed digital CCD camera (2048 × 2048 pixels). The pixel resolution is 5.06 µm, which is a function of the optical bench setup. Synchrotron radiation provides several advantages over conventional Xray sources, including the production of a homogeneous, parallel, monochromatic and highly coherent photon flux. This results in high-quality images having a resolution of about the size of the voxel dimension. For a given energy of incident X-ray beam (here 40 keV), the attenuation depends on the chemical composition of the rock, specifically, the atomic number of its components and their mass fraction per volume (i.e. the density). In mono-crystalline rocks such as the samples studied here, XMT images yield the distribution of densities in the rock, or in other words, 3D porosity maps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental results and discussion</head><p>Changes of permeability and porosity in porous media are attributed to dissolution and precipitation. These dynamic processes are constrained from concurrent measurements of evolving permeability, mineral mass flux and sample pore structure. Because of the non-destructive nature of XMT imaging, we can also observe the progression of the chemical reaction over the porous sample as well as related morphological changes.</p></div>

As described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Golfier et al. (2002)</ref>, the dissolution mechanism, at the pore-scale, can be separated into three steps: i) transport (by diffusion and advection) of the reactants to the reaction surface, ii) heterogeneous reaction at the surface (i.e. surface reaction), and iii) transport of reaction products away from the surface. The effective kinetics is controlled by the slowest of these three steps. It is generally accepted that transport of the solute to and from the reactive surface is associated with similar characteristic times. Thus, between the local increase of pore diameter and the renewal capacity of the fluid in these enlarged pores <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hoefner and Fogler, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Golfier et al., 2002)</ref>. In this case, we would expect the formation of highly conductive flow channels, known as wormholes. The distribution and shape of the wormholes are controlled by the (initial) heterogeneity of the pore structure and the correlation length of the (initial) permeability field. For the value of Pe encountered here, we expect the properties of the wormholes to be independent of Pe because the diffusive transport is negligible.</p><p>Using equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">5</ref>), the sample-averaged reaction rate γ is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">( ) * ∆ - = Ca r C V I S r φ γ ) 1 ( ,<label>(8) where ( ) *</label></formula><p>∆ Ca C is the asymptotical, i.e. for e t τ &gt;&gt; , calcium mass balance in the sample (i.e. </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">Q I S r C C r in out - + ≈ 1 Ca Ca .

Porosity measured by processing the XMT data <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Noiriel et al., 2005</ref>) is expected to be misevaluated because of the cutoff scale imposed by the voxel size dimension. Indeed, the surface roughness and microstructures of the micritic cement are not properly resolved because they are on a smaller scale than the XMT resolution (i.e. 5.06 µm).</p><p>Nevertheless, both the cements and oolith roughness microstructures display large reactive surface-areas and are dissolved in the early stage of the experiments (i.e. e t τ &lt; ). For each of the dissolution experiments, the porosity measured by XMT at the end of the experiment is the best evaluation of the true porosity.

We should point out that the samples used for the three dissolution experiments are similar, with an initial permeability of around 35 × 10 -15 m 2 , while the sample used in experiment P1 has a higher initial permeability (i.e. 180 × 10 -15 m 2 ), even all samples were taken side-by-side from the same core. are nevertheless associated with a single rate of decrease in porosity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">10</ref>). The origin of this behaviour is discussed in the next section. Permeability is an intrinsic macroscopic property of the rock that results from a combination of several parameters including the geometry of the pores and throats, as well as, more importantly, the sample-scale connectivity of the voids <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Mavko and Nur, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pape et al. 1999)</ref>. In spite of this complexity, the essential behaviour can often be evaluated successfully from the porosity φ using power-law relationships such as the Kozeny-Carman model <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kozeny, 1927;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Carman, 1937)</ref>:</p></div>

For example, the values of n and m for homogeneous sandstones (e.g. Fontainebleau sandstones) are close to 3 and 2, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bernabé et al., 2003)</ref>. Evidently, in the case of rocks displaying complex pore structures, such as lowporosity carbonate rocks, the specific surface-area is not measurable and is certainly not the main parameter controlling permeability.

These authors (op.cit.) show that this relation gives rise to an asymptotic trend under conditions of dominantly homogeneous dissolution.

We should bear in mind that the saturation index depends on Ca concentration alone, because all the other parameters are constant and the rock samples are identical. Up to this point in the discussion, our results show that dissolution can display distinctly different patterns along the path followed by CO 2 -enriched fluids in the reservoir.However, we cannot use this observation to model reservoir-scale processes until both the porosity changes and the related permeability changes are parameterized according to the fluid composition. Hence, our objective is to establish a relation between the measured sample-scale porosity-permeability relationship and the value of Da.</figDesc></figure>

This set of the most probable in situ conditions.As a general rule, we expect non-uniform dissolution to occur near the injection well in calcite-rich reservoirs because of the high reactivity of calcite at low pH conditions. The experiment performed with 2 CO P close to the total pressure P supports the formation of highly conductive long-distance correlated flow channels, indicating transport-controlled dissolution. These features strongly modify the permeability, while the macroscopic porosity is only moderately affected. For intermediate values of 2 CO P , the mass transfer changes from transport-controlled to kinetically-controlled dissolution. Uniform dissolution is obtained for 2 CO P = 2.5 MPa. These three dissolution experiments display distinctly different scaling laws relating the variations of porosity against permeability. Clearly, classical laws relating permeability (k) to porosity (φ) using rock-dependent parameterization alone cannot account for changes in permeability triggered by local fluid-rock disequilibrium. Hence, macroscale porosity-permeability relationships must be parameterized not only to reflect the rock-typedependent properties, as generally performed when modelling low-reactivity systems, but also to take account of the local dissolution regime. Finally, for the experiment with 2 CO P = 0.7, i.e. reproducing conditions far from the injection well, we observe a uniform decrease of the porosity associated with dolomitization of the reservoir. However, the rate of decrease in permeability rises sharply as the porosity approaches c φ , indicating a probable clogging of the medium if dolomitization conditions persist.Using this set of experiments, we extract step by step the macroscopic parameters required to formulate the dependence of the porosity-permeability scaling on local fluid-rock disequilibrium:1) The value of porosity at the percolation threshold is evaluated using the value of Da for each of the non-uniform dissolution experiments (i.e10 MPa) is calculated from the amount of calcium produced in the sample, 4) The exponent n of the porosity-permeability power law in the relation asymptotic dissolution regime for each of the experiments, 5) The relationship n versus Da is fitted to produce a macroscopic phenomenological law that can be upscaled easily to be implemented in classical reservoir numerical simulators.</figDesc></figure>
