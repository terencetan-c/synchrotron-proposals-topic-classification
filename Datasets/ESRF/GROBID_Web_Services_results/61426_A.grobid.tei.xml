Ramos (University of Kent) Dr. G. Cibin (Diamond Light Source) Dr. M. Hoesch (Diamond Light Source) Miss. S. Rowe (University of Kent) Report:</p><p>Background: Two samples were measured during the allocated beamtime, Rb 2 Mo 2 Se 6 and Tl 2 Mo 6 Se 6 . Both materials form a uniaxial hexagonal structure, with space group P63/m, where (Mo3Se3)∞ chains run along the c-axis. The guest ions in between the chains is Rb in one case and Tl in the other. It is known that these crystals are non-stoichiometric, with vacancies on the interstitial sites but the chains are highly crystalline. These two materials belong to a family of quasi-1D systems with interesting properties and that tend to be borderline beweeen superconducting and insulating transitions. Rb 2 Mo 6 Se 6 in particular is insulating at low temperatures and shows a resistivity upturn with a resistance minimum between 100 and 250 K, depending on the sample. Tl 2 Mo 6 Se 6 is a conducting material that tunrs superconducting at ~ 6 K but also shows anomalies on the transport measurements (upturn in thermopower, zerocrossing of the Hall coefficient at ~80 K). The formation of charge density waves (CDW) has been suggested for both materials as a possible explanation of their conducting properties. However, there has been no direct evidence of the formation of CDW in any diffraction or ARPES data collected so far. The results from these measurements exclude the formation of long-range-ordered distortions in these materials. The experiment we carried out at BM28 was designed to probe the presence of short-range lattice distortions in Rb 2 Mo 6 Se 6 at temperatures below the minimum in the resistance for this material (~100K). This scenario is compatible with theoretical calculations of the structure, which suggested that a twist-mode rotation of the Mo 3 triangles was energetically favourable in this material. Tl 2 Mo 6 Se 6 should not undergo that type of transition in that temperature range and can hence be used as a reference (although this second sample could potentially also show a structural transition at lower temperatures).</p><p>Experiment: we carried out the experiment on small, needle-like single crystals (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for an example) of approximately 3mm x 0.25mm. We used a He4 cryostat with a Be dome to control the temperature over the required range and a Vortex Si-drift diode as our detector. We concentrated most of our measurements on the Se K-edge (12,6578 keV) and measured up to 1,000 eV over the absorption edge to cover both the XANES and EXFAS regions. We also collected some test data at the Mo K-edge as a feasibility test. We found that data could be collected and the beam was stable but, as expected, the flux was significanlty suppressed. It would have taken us more than factor of 3 longer to collect data at the Mo K-edge if we wanted to obtain comparable statistics with respect to the Se K-edge.</p><p>We concluded that for this specific experiment that was not a good use of beamtime and did not pursue measurements in this energy range. The crystals available for the experiment were of good quality but small with respect to the beam size; hence the measurements were sensitive to beam/sample stability, not to the point that it would stop us from collecting good and reproducible data but it did mean that the useful range of data was more limited at the higher energy (or k) range than it could have been if larger crystals had been avaible. At the Se K-edge we collected data at the following temperatures and angles:</p><p>Rb 2 Mo 6 Se 6 .-temperatures: 4K, 75K, 100K, 150K (missing two highest angles), 295K. angles: 0 o , 10 o , 30 o , 50 o , 70 o , 90 o , 110 o . Tl 2 Mo 6 Se 6 .-temperatures: 4K, 8K, 75K, 100K, 150K, 295K. angles: 0 o , 10 o , 30 o , 50 o , 70 o , 90 o .</p><p>Results: overall, we can say the experiment was successful. Detailed analysis is ongoing but a preliminary screening of the data show a structural distortion in the Rb 2 Mo 6 Se 6 EXAFS data (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), hence confirming that there is a change in the local structure that might potentially be linked to the metal-insulator transition. We are in the process of modelling the data to identify which atomic positions are responsible for this change in the signal. There is no evidence of a similar transition in the Tl 2 Mo 6 Se 6 , which again supports the link between the distortion and the turn in the conductivity data for the Rb sample. The effect is most evident for the measurements with the polarisation in the ab-plane and parallel to c (only one showed due to space limitations).</p><p>We will be presenting these results at SCES17 (abstract accepted for a poster) and intend to publish the results in the near future. 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 0 2 4 4K polarization ||c 100K polarization ||c 150K polarization ||c R (Å) |χ(R)| Figure 2: EXAFS data as a function of R for Rb 2 Mo 6 Se 6 at three different temperatures. Note that at the lowest temperature the peak at ~ 3.5 Å is broader, with a more intense shoulder that can only be explained by a distortion in the structure.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>FigureFigure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 1: SEM image of the Rb2Mo6Se6 sample measured at Xmas.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,30.96,81.52,171.12,130.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>
