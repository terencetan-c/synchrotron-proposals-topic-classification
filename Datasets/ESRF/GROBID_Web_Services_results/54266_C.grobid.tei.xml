We have measured for all sets of samples XANES spectra during air annealing and full EXAFS spectra at specific annealing conditions. During air annealing the temperature was increased up to 490 Â°C. To test higher temperatures and oxygen rich atmosphere (larger air volume) we have also performed ex-situ annealing treatments in air. Some sets of samples during air annealing form urchins structures. The urchin formation was tested by scanning electron microscopy at ESRF. The experiment allowed to monitor the Co site during oxidation in general and urchin formation when it was the case. The experimental spectra from the samples were compared with those of Co-based compounds with defined oxidation state and site geometry. As an example, three XANES spectra from the PLD as-deposited samples (A, B, C) are shown below, indicating how the Co oxidation state depends on the deposition conditions.</p></div>

This fraction is maybe correlated with the urchin formation. Nevertheless, the XAS spectra measured the average Co site in the samples, i.e., including both Co in the particles/urchins AND Co in the flat part of the deposited layer. Part of data have been published in the ref. above. To fully understand the mechanism of urchin formation, a new XAS experiment is needed to focus selectively on the Co site in the particles/urchins.</figDesc></figure>
