<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The historical goal of this proposal is to obtain scientific proofs of the relationship between the different painters and schools during the transition from Gothic to Renaissance in the critical 15 th AD century in Catalonia, finding out the influences and connections with other European regions. The study includes the investigation of a selection of master artworks belonging to the MNAC (Museu Nacional d'Art Nacional de Catalunya) by means of the analysis of pigments, binders, preparation layers and reaction/aging compounds.</p><p>The scientific goal is threefold: First, to establish a methodology including specific sample preparation and the selection of adequate chemical and structural analytical techniques with ten micron resolution for the full identification of submillimetric mixtures of compounds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Secondly, to produce a database including all the information obtained from the pigments, reaction, alteration and aging compounds for use in future studies. The reproduction of the processes of synthesis following medieval treatises will be one of the keys of the study allowing a full and unambiguous characterization of the original materials. In order to study reaction (drying) and alteration and aging compounds, natural and artificial process will be induced to determine the physical and chemical mechanisms responsible.</p><p>Thirdly, a substantial upgrade of the beamline, due to the implementation of a focusing device (10 to 50 micron spot size) allowing for (quasi-) simultaneous micro-XRF, micro-HRPD and possibly Raman spectroscopy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report of Year 1 work.</head><p>During this first year the following tasks have been fully developed:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1-Selection and preparation of ancient paintings</head><p>Selection of the 15 th century AD painters, from each of them one altarpiece produced after year 1440 was selected, samples were extracted and specific preparations were made. Optical Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy where performed in our laboratory. SR-FT-IR was performed through a European funded project in SRS-Daresbury Laboratory (UK). SR-FTIR is especially important for the identification of organic compounds, that is, the binders, varnishes and glues used. The altarpieces and samples selected and analysed up to now are indicated in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. An example of the samples' preparations and some of the previous analysis is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Table 1. author Altarpiece an wood carvingd Year Samples Lluis Dalmau, ?-1460 La Mare de Déu dels Consellers 1443 D1 toD8 Jacomar (Jaume Baço), 1410-1461 L'aparició de la Mare de Deu a Sant Francesc a la Porciúncula c. 1440 J1 to J6 Bernat Martorell, 1390-1452 Sant Vicenç de Menargues 1438-1440 BM1 to BM7 Jaume Huguet, 1412-1492 Sant Vicenç de Sarrià c. 1440 JH1 to JH8 Anonymous Museu Diocesà de Lleida Last years 15 th century AD MDL1 to MDL8 Anonymous Saint John's sculpture carved on wood, plastered and painted.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">High resolution X-ray Powder Diffraction and X-ray Fluorescence of the ancient samples.</head><p>In the beamtime allocations we have performed High Resolution X-ray powder Diffraction of the samples. The high resolution of the detector has been fundamental in order to discriminate between the complex mixtures of compounds forming the paintings. The X-Ray Fluorescence detector has been also attached during the measurement and simultaneous Fluorescence analyses have also been obtained from the same samples.</p><p>As an example of the identification of compounds in the samples in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> we present the low angle region corresponding to the HR-PD from sample D3. This is a blue pigment formed by two successive layers of two different blue natural pigments: azurite, a copper basic carbonate -Cu 3 (CO 3 ) 2 (OH) 2 -, and lapis-lazuli, a blue rock formed by a mixture of minerals. In  0.1 mm 5 1 0 1 5 2θ Intensity (a.u) lazurite/sodalite nepheline/albite phlogopite/quartz azurite diopside lapislazuli</p><p>This mixture is characteristic of the lapis-lazuli natural deposits, for example from Afghanistan. Thanks to the high resolution of the detector it has been possible to unambiguously identify the mixture of compounds. The quality of the data is high enough to Rietvelt refine it in order to determine the crystallographic parameters of the phases present and also their relative amounts, this is important allow us to compare to the natural lapis lazulis studied from the different geographic regions and therefore to relate the pigment to a source region.</p><p>Apart from the pigments, compounds associated to the pigments and present in very small amounts could also be identified. This is very important, because it can help in determining original sources if the pigments are natural, or the processes followed in their synthesis if the pigments are synthetic. The other pigments corresponding to the samples studied until now have also been identified. This will be published in a series of papers for the Museum Bulletin concerning each of the altarpieces studied (1,2). There, the identification of the pigments and binders is shown. This series of papers are dedicated to the Art Historians and Conservators. The first paper will appear in the next number of the Bulletin of the Museum and corresponds to the "Mare de Deu dels Consellers" from Lluis Dalmau. (1) Moreover, the high resolution of the detector has been fundamental in determining not only the pigments but also reaction and aging compounds. The identification of reaction and also of aging compounds that appear in extremely small amounts is very complex, because the difficulties involved in their identification. There are no previous references on this subject in the literature, and we are writing a publication for a journal dedicated to Analytical Chemistry (3). Moreover, it is also very important for the Conservation of the art works. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows an example of the identification of the alteration compounds, it corresponds to the armour of one of the knights represented in the "Retaule de Sant Vicenç" from Jaume Huguet. The armours are plated with silver which appears completely altered. The presence of chlorargyrite (AgCl) as main alteration compound and other compounds has been possible thanks to the high resolution and sensibility of the detector. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3-Reference materials. Aged compounds. Synthetic and reactions compounds.</head><p>A second objective of this first year was to measure a complete collection of reference materials, aged materials and synthetic materials produced in the laboratory but following ancient recipes.

Some of the reference materials have been mixed with different binders (egg and oil) to study the reaction compounds formed during drying. We have already observed some significant differences in the reaction compounds formed using the different binders although the full drying process has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, new analyses will be performed during the next year in order to follow the drying process and the development the reaction compounds. Although some first results have already been obtained, this is a long term task; we expect to collect the three years data and obtain the reactivity of the pigments with the different binders and the resulting reaction compounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Technical aspects.</head><p>Up to now we have performed simultaneous high resolution powder diffraction and X-ray fluorescence measurements of submillimetric samples. We already performed some first tests to incorporate the Raman spectrometer to the beamline in order to perform simultaneous Raman Spectroscopy. Some modifications in the setup of the experiment have to be performed in order to incorporate the Raman spectrometer; we plan to do this next year. A second improvement will be the incorporation of a focusing device that will improve the sensitivity of the measurements because it will allow to measure small areas of the samples. This will also be implemented in the future.</p></div>
