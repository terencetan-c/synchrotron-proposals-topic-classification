<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Reactivity of Ti 3 SiC 2 and liquid metallic alloys: from brazing applications to graphene-like material synthesis </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report summary:</head><p>The objectives addressed by the present proposal were to highlight the evolution of Ti 3 SiC 2 in contact with a liquid metallic alloy (LMA) in terms of composition and structure. In-situ XRD experiments carried out on ID15A were chosen to follow Ti 3 SiC 2 evolution during the reactivity with the LMA whereas ex-situ high resolution XRD (ID31) was selected to determine the structural modifications of Ti 3 SiC 2 and identify the secondary phases formed.</p><p>No scientific result was obtained after this beamtime, mainly due to technical issues both from the beamline and the setup, even if 3 additional beamtime shifts were given (end of the beamtime on Tuesday 29 th instead of Monday 28 th ). First of all, we gratefully acknowledge ID15 staff for the additional beamtime given. Secondly, we are strongly motivated in solving the setup issues in order to authorize unique in-situ liquid/solid reactivity studies. Once the setup will be validated, we will resubmit new proposals. Our only request might be to have a beamtime starting on Wednesday after a MDT day.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Technical aspects:</head><p>Technical aspects of the allocated beamtime are splitted in two paragraphs.</p><p>1. Beamline issues Allocated beamtime was 9 shifts on ID15, starting on January, Friday 24 th . Beamline staff support was excellent on Friday with, in addition of the local contact who did the alignement of the slits, beamstop and detector, the help of T. Buslaps for the detector physical installation, M. DiMichiel for Perkin Elmer detector tests and advices of use, A. Mauro for connection of eurotherm controllers to SPEC and M. Scheel for beam tuning. In addition, problem of front end closing due to local beamline interlock malfunction was observed and solved by the beamline staff. The induction furnace was ready to be installed only on Friday end of the afternoon and we did the furnace installation and connection on Friday night. On Saturday, we did the furnace alignment and then we prepared the first experiment. However, we found out many beamline problems. First problem was beam instability observed on ID15B. Tests were realized by M. DiMichiel and S. Kimber to understand the origin of this instability and to know the influence of this instability on ID15A beam. Second problem was SPEC communications with motors and counters. We asked the intervention of BLISS support to solve this problem. Third problem was the remote control of eurotherm controllers by SPEC due to wrong configuration of the eurotherm as well as bad temperature regulation on the sample for the same reason. Finally, we were able to run the first experiment on Sunday afternoon, after using 7 shits for beamline tuning and solving issues. MA-1598 beamtime was extended by 3 additional shifts until Tuesday 29 th 8 a.m., and this additional beamtime was used to conduct 3 experiments. None of them was successful. Lack of scientific results is also due to setup issues as described in the following part.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Solid/liquid reactivity set-up</head><p>The furnace used for MA-1598 beamtime is available in the Sample Environment Pool at ESRF (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and allows working under vacuum (10 -5 mbar). However, the setup for liquid/solid reactivity studies was not existing before this beamtime. As soon as beamtime was allocated to this proposal, we got in contact with B. Gorges and H. Vitoux in order to develop the reactivity set-up (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In addition, we came at ESRF to help in the development and the preliminary tests of the set-up in September (1 day), October (2 days) and December (3 days). More in details, the sample solid powder is placed in a graphite crucible (A, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) heated independantly by a resistive heater (B, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The alloy (compacted powder) is placed in a graphite tube and melted by induction (C, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In this way, the sample powder can be heated first to be desoxidized and the beginning of the reaction is controlled by the melting of the alloy. We wish to mention that a lot of work was done by H. Vitoux in order to prepare the furnace for MA-1598 and we gratefully acknowledge H. Vitoux and B.Gorges. Despite the failure of MA-1598 beamtime, we are strongly motivated to develop a set-up allowing insitu liquid/solid reactivity studies at ESRF, as this kind of studies is the heart of our research activity. We have already submitted a request for budget at the University Lyon 1 in order to make different modifications on the actual setup. For example, we are planning to heat both the sample and the alloy by induction, designing a new induction coil, in order to avoid the temperature limitation from the resistive heater. Then, we will design and build an automated system allowing the control of the liquid alloy slide on the powder. In addition, the use of getter inside the furnace combined with vitreous carbon as a material for the crucible are two approaches amongst others we will explore to improve the vacuum quality.</p><p>Finally, the 6 shifts of beamtime on ID31 were mainly based on samples obtained during the in-situ reactivity study carried out on ID15. Following the absence of successful experiment on ID15, we ask to postpone ID31 beamtime. It is to note that we will synthetize the samples ex-situ and be able to do the ID31 part of the proposal in the coming months.</p><p>C A B</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): -Dr. Andrieux Jerome*, Lab. des Multimatériaux et Interfaces, Université Lyon 1 -Dr. Dezellus Olivier*, Lab. des Multimatériaux et Interfaces, Université Lyon 1 -Samer Nassim*, Lab. des Multimatériaux et Interfaces, Université Lyon 1</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. Induction furnace available at SEP, ESRF Figure 2. Liquid/solid reactivity set-up Following MA-1598 beamtime, three technical issues were identified: -Vacuum quality. Starting with a residual pressure of 10 -5 mbar at 900°C, no wetting of the powder by the liquid alloy was observed. Different attempts were made during the beamtime to improve the vacuum quality and to decrease the oxygen partial pressure in the chamber, but still we were not able to observe the wetting of the powder by the liquid alloy. This explains the lack of scientific results after the beamtime. -Temperature limitation on the sample to 900 °C. It is due to the heater capacity and the offset observed between the heater and the sample due to heat loss. -No precise control of the volume of liquid in contact with the powder.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,45.60,212.75,222.25,166.45" type="bitmap" /></figure>
