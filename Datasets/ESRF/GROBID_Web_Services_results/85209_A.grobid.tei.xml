<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The study of the self-assembly of two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic coordination networks (MOCNs) exhibiting magnetic coupling has increased in the past few years <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The usage of versatile molecular building blocks with magnetic metallic centers, such as porphyrin derivatives allow the formation of periodic 2D arrays displaying magnetic coupling given by the unpaired d-electrons of transition metals contained within the porhpyrin core. The magnetic properties of these networks can be investigated by means of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The aim of our XMCD measurements was to investigate the magnetic coupling of the two transition metals Nickel (embedded in the porphyrin core) and Cobalt (acting as coordinating metal center) embedded in a 2D MOCN adsorbed on a non-magnetic surface.</p><p>Before coming to the ID32 beamline, we investigated the self-assembly of periodic 2D networks formed by Co and Ni porphyrin derivatives supported on Au(111) and graphene/Ir(111) with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) at our home laboratory at the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials at University of Groningen. The molecules were deposited onto the substrates by thermal evaporation, while keeping the substrates at RT. All experiments were carried under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions. We employed 4 different types of porphyrin derivatives: Nickel For the cyanophenyl porphyrin derivatives (Ni-TCPP and Co-TCPP) we report the formation of a closepacked H-bonded network on either Au(111) or grahpene/Ir(111). Upon deposition of Co-atoms onto the networks supported on Au(111), a 4-fold Co-coordination takes place, where one Co-atom coordinates to 4 cyano substituents of neighboring cyanophenyl porphyrins. Similarly, both Ni-DPPyP and Ni-DHPyP compounds form a H-bonded network on Au(111). The deposition of cobalt atoms onto both of these closepacked networks and subsequent annealing at 150 ºC lead to the formation of a Co-coordinated hexagonal porous network. We aimed to reproduce our 2D molecular networks at the ID32 beamline. The Au(111) and Ir(111) crystals were cleanned by repeated cycles of sputtering with Ar + ions and annealing. Graphene was grown on Ir(111) at the electron beam heating stage by using ethylene as carbon precursor and mainting the substrate at 1,100 °C. The molecules were thermally evaporated from our evaporator and the deposition rate was monitored via a quartz crystal microbalance. The molecule evaporator and quartz microbalance were mounted to a 6-way cross adapted to the load lock chamber. Co-atoms were deposited from a rod using an ebeam metal evaporator provided by the beamline ID32. The 2D networks were analyzed at RT with an Omicron VT-STM to corroborate their structural arrangement with our previous findings. We were not able to reproduce the systems for Ni-DPPyP and Ni-DHPyP due to evaporation problems and therefore proceeded to only measure the cyanophenyl derivatives.</p><p>We performed XMCD measurements at the ID32 beamline under different conditions. Measurements of the Co and Ni L 2;3 edges for the 2D networks were done at normal and grazing incidence, the magnetic field (B) was varied between 9 T and -9 T for various measurements. The acquired spectra were analyzed with the PyMca software. This software provided a fast analysis to obtain the XMCD signal by obtaining the difference (µ --µ + ) between left and right circularly polarized spectra. Aditionally, the magnetization curves for samples of Co-TCPP on Au(111) and on graphene/Ir(111) were obtained.</p><p>The XMCD spectra shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> were obtained at normal incidence (θ= 0°) with a mangetic field of 9 T. The top row corresponds to the X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements of the Co L 2;3 absorption edge for (a) Co-TCPP on Au( <ref type="formula">111</ref>  The XMCD spectra in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> taken at normal incidence (θ= 0°) with a mangetic field of 9 T belong to 2D networks supported on graphene/Ir(111). The top row displays the X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements of the Co L 2;3 absorption edge for (a) Co-TCPP and the Ni L 2;3 absorption edge for (b) Ni-TCPP and (c) multilayer coverage of Ni-TCPP.
