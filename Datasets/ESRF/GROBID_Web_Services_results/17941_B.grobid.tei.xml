<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the first commissioning experiments with the cryostat in autumn 1999, sometimes the technical problem arose that it was impossible to get one continuous EXAFS scan over a wide k range. In spite of the fact that this situation was overcome, the idea of connecting two different parts of an EXAFS scan in a unique way was developed. So, the computer program SPLICE was written to merge two different EXAFS spectra of the same sample in an overlapping energy region. The word "splice" was chosen because of the analogy to the old sailing trade "splicing". The SPLICE program may be a useful tool to overcome difficulties due to insufficient time during an EXAFS experiment. Different situations may cause such time problems, e.g.:</p><p>-Any interruption or perturbation of the synchrotron beam, -The refill times are too frequent for the experiment, -Only the noisy part (in general the rear part of the spectrum) needs some repetitions for an amendment of the statistics of the EXAFS scan.</p><p>Two raw EXAFS scans of the same sample, F 1 and F 2 , are given. Both sets are recorded at different energy regions with an overlapping region of about 50 data points. The intention of the program is to find an optimal translation for F 2 (concerning x and y) and a re-FDOLEUDWLRQ IDFWRU IRU VSOLFLQJ ERWK VFDQV WRJHWKHU WR KDQGOH WKHP OLNH RQH FRQWLQXRXV VFDQ.</p><p>Experiments were performed to test the SPLICE program using real EXAFS spectra up to a k of 22 Å -1 at the U L III edge of a uranyl arsenate sample (H 2 [UO 2 AsO 4 ] 2 ⋅8H 2 O). To reduce thermal vibrations, the sample was cooled to 15 K using a closed-cycle He cryostat. Three different EXAFS spectra, their Fourier transforms and fit-results were compared. The first two spectra consist of two different scans connected by the program SPLICE, and the third spectrum consists of one uninterrupted continuous scan.</p><p>• Splice A: Two absorption spectra, both scanned with an equal step in k-space of ∆k = 0.05 Å -1 are spliced at k =15 Å -1 to give an EXAFS-spectrum with a length of k = 22 Å -1 . • Splice B: Two absorption spectra, the first scanned with an equal step in k-space of ∆k = 0.05 Å -1 and the second with an equal step of ∆k = 0.02 Å -1 are spliced at k = 15 Å -1 to give an EXAFS spectrum with a length of k = 22 Å -1 as demonstration of the ability of the SPLICE program to connect two scans recorded with different steps in k-space.</p><p>• Without splicing C: For comparison with the spliced spectra, one entire spectrum was recorded over the whole range of k = 22 Å -1 with an equal step of ∆k = 0.05 Å -1 .</p></div>

For comparison, table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the numerical values of the fitted data including the standard deviations. The differences between the fit results have the same order as the usual experimental uncertainties of EXAFS measurements. Therefore, the possibility to connect two different absorption spectra of the same sample with an overlapping energy region using the program SPLICE is demonstrated by examples.</p><p>@ @ ∆ ∆ A A % %ÃDrhy 8hypyhvÃ6rh Srtv Pryhvt 6ivÃpurhvp @rtÃbrWd )LJXUH 6FKHPDWLF LOOXVWUDWLRQ RI WKH WDVN RI WKH SURJUDP 63/,&amp;( The final range of the parameters found is usually: |∆x| &lt; 1 eV, |∆y| &lt; 0.005, |λ-1| &lt; 0.001 $ % &amp; $ % &amp; Coord. shell 1 5 &gt; c @ Oax 1.94(0.11) 2.05(0.10) 1.82(0.10) 1.789(0.003) 1.791(0.002) 1.790(0.002) Oeq 4.65(0.26) 4.31(0.22) 4.76(0.25) 2.296(0.003) 2.306(0.002) 2.302(0.003) As 3.99(0.17) 4.15(0.15) 3.90(0.15) 3.702(0.001) 3.700(0.001) 3.702(0.001) U1 5.88(0.67) 5.16(0.49) 5.32(0.57) 5.402(0.003) 5.400(0.002) 5.400(0.003) U2 4.61(1.16) 5.88(1.17) 5.92(1.32) 7.191(0.006) 7.181(0.004) 7.180(0.005)</p></div>		</body>
