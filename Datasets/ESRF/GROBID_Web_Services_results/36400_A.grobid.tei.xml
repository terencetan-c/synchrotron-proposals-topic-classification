<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Setup</head><p>The sample analysed was a Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 TiO 3 (BST) single crystal thin film of 400 nm thickness grown on a single crystal MgO substrate of dimensions 10×10×0.5 mm. The sample was mounted in a 17x17 mm polymer carrier and wire bonded to electrical contacts (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a)). The sample was loaded into a liquid nitrogen cooled cryostat constructed especially for this experiment by ESRF, containing high voltage lines for application of up to 1 kV to the sample (Figure <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref>).</p><p>Connections to the liquid nitrogen dewar, temperature controller, and power supply.</p><p>'Sample chamber' with mylar wall. The sample was mounted on the holder with connection to the power supply for dc-bias application.</p></div>

The sensitivity to electric field was desired in particular to elucidate the mechanism of the field-dependence of the dielectric properties, which is our main research focus. To this end the high energy X-ray beam (70 keV) at ID15 was focussed to a microbeam of dimensions approximately 15 x 8 μm and directed at grazing incidence onto the sample between the silver electrodes on the top surface (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2a</ref>). This positioning between the electrodes was achieved by monitoring the X-ray fluoresence from silver while scanning the sample beneath the beam, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2(b)</ref>.</p><p>(b) (a) mca silver (counts) 0 400 800 1200 silver film silver film silver Vdc substrate film Silver MAR Plate X-rays</p><p>Unfortunately, secondary scattering from the carrier required for connection of the electic bias lines in the cryostat to the sample was stronger than anticipated due to the need for grazing incidence geometry, so the sample had to be removed from the carrier. A new carrier without sidewalls has been designed in anticipation of a further beamtime allocation. We were, however, able to make a series of temperature scans in the absence of applied voltage.</p></div>

The onset of the transition was observed at 240 K, where the 'streaks' were observed on the (h01) peaks (Figure <ref type="figure">3(b)</ref>). The 'streaks' started to disappear at 280 K. This phase transition at temperature range of 240 K -280 K was consistent with that observed from our previous microwave measurements of the dielectric properties and from Raman spectroscopy.</p><p>The phase transition was also directly evident in the temperature dependence of the d-spacings of the ( <ref type="formula">100</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">101</ref>) planes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4(a)</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The temperature dependence of the lattice parameters of the BST film has been determined from this experiment. The transition temperature and breadth of the transition were comparable with those deduced indirectly from dieletric measurements and Raman spectroscopy. However, the accuracy of the lattice parameters obtained from this preliminary experiment was not as high as desired, due in part to errors originating from our inexperience (this was our first detailed study of a single crystal thin film using synchrotron radiation). The errors and the steps that will be taken to overcome them in a future beamtime were:</p><p>• there were many overexposed peaks which created difficulty in finding the center and intensity of the diffraction peaks. This will be avoided by the use of slits and/or shorter exposure times to reduce the overall beam intensity; • the tilt on the diffraction patterns, that caused difficulty in determining the width of the peaks directly from the FIT2D software. These tilts were temperature sensitive and so could not be corrected from the original calibration at room temperature. These could be removed by calibration from the substrate peaks if a wider range of incident and azimuthal angles are made available to probe more diffraction peaks; • the resolution of the image pixel size on the setting of the MAR plate detector was barely sufficient to follow the changes in lattice parameter so the pixel size will be reduced from 150 µm to 100 µm (150 was thought sufficient and chosen to minimise file storage space). Further gains could be achieved by changing the data collection geometry, e.g. via increasing the sample to detector distance and/or moving the detector sideways to sample further out in reciprocal space. With these changes, it should be possible to reliably track changes in the lattice parameters and strain under changing temperature and under electric field bias.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 (a) Grazing incidence of x-ray diffraction beam on the sample surface and diffracted onto the MAR plate, (b) Intensity of silver counts from x-ray fluoresecence across the sample surface say (mm) 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 2 . 0 2 . 2</figDesc><graphic coords="3,47.70,228.60,153.59,79.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
