<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the experiment HS4147 we have investigated the local structure of well ordered (In,Ga)P/GaAs(001) surface undulations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The surface undulations which are aligned along the <ref type="bibr">[-110</ref>] direction appear on a In 0.48 Ga 0.52 P layer grown lattice-matched on GaAs. They are observed when the molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth is performed at elevated temperature (470°C) while at lower temperature a smooth and isotropic surface morphology shows up. This phenomenon is of high scientific and technological relevance since the surface undulations can be used as a natural template for subsequent well defined MBE growth of InP quantum dots (QDs) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) [1]. The microscopic mechanisms leading to the (In,Ga)P surface undulations are not yet understood.. Lateral compositional modulation (LCM) and CuPt B like long range atomic ordering (LRO) are the most frequently discussed mechanisms causing the surface undulations as observed in Figure 1a and polarization dependent photoluminescence experiments (not shown here) indicate the presence of both mechanisms.</p><p>To examine the atomic arrangement by Ga and In K-edge fluorescent EXAFS, we prepared different types of samples (i) with and (ii) without surface undulations and (iii) with InP QDs. An EXAFS experiment has been already performed at BM26A (DUBBLE beamline) at ESRF (see report HS 4147). Here, the In K-edge was measured on different samples in the temperature range from 12K to 300K. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> displays the EXAFS signal in the vicinity of the In Kedge for one of our In 0.48 Ga 0.52 P/GaAs structures and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> shows the corresponding Fourier transformation. These investigations at BM26A have been very useful since they demonstrate that our structure has a significant dependency on temperature. This could be an indication of atomic SRO which is expected to depend on temperature. However, just a part of the suggested scientific programm could be covered in the experiment, since severe experimental restrictions were present during this beam time:</p><p>• At BM26A the signal was detected by measuring the x-ray fluorescence yield. For working at the In Kedge this -in principle -should work since Indium is expected to appear in the In 0.48 Ga 0.52 P layer only, and it does not appear in the GaAs substrate. However, we are interested in the local atomic structure in the very-near-surface region in the proximity of the surface undulations. However, owing to the large energy of In K-fluorescence the EXAFS signal is dominated from volume of the entire In 0.48 Ga 0.52 P layer (250 nm thickness) and not from the surface region which is about 3 nm thick. For that reason the interpretation of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref> is difficult.</p><p>• For similar reasons EXAFS close to the Ga K-edge could not be investigated since the signal from the In 0.48 Ga 0.52 P layer cannot be distinguished from the strong signal caused by the GaAs substrate. Again, a suppression of the signal from the GaAs substrate could have be achieved by using e.g. secondary electrons which exhibit a small information depth. For technical reasons, the detection of secondary electrons was, however, not possible at BM26A.</p><p>• The P K-edge was not accessible in this experiment.</p><p>• A limited number of just 9 shifts have been allocated. Unfortunately a further reduction of experimental time (about 2 shifts) appeared due to experimental problems (long beam loss, problems with interlock system). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: Surface morphology (AFM) of (a) 250 nm thick In 0.48 Ga 0.52 P grown on GaAs (001) by gas source MBE at T = 470°C and, (b) InP quantum dots grown on undulated In 0.48 Ga 0.52 P layer.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,404.76,584.16,154.68,154.68" type="bitmap" /></figure>
