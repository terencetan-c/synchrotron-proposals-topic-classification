<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report :</head><p>In this study our objective was to better understand how squalene-based nanoparticles, containing Cisplatin (CisPt), are distributed within various mouse organs, using X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) of platin atoms. Besides, we wanted to compare two types of nanoparticles to the commercial treatment without the drug incorporated into nanoparticles.</p><p>In this respect, we prepared different tissue sections (10 to 20 μm thick), from ten kinds of organs: brain, tumor, fat, kidney, muscle, stomach, spleen, hearth, lungs, intestine, collected after an in vivo experimentation and embedded into paraffin. The samples have been obtained under various conditions: number of terpenoid-chains bioconjugated to CisPt (1 or 2 chains are linked to the CisPt) administrated in mice, delay after an intravenous injection in mice (2, 8 or 24 hours), type of administration (oral administration or intravenously). The same samples from untreated mouse and the commercial drug (CisPt) were used as control samples. The different tissue sections were inserted between two 4 µm thick ultralene foils.</p><p>Data collection was carried out at beamline ID13 with an incident energy of 14 keV and a beam size 2*2 µm 2 . The location of platinum (Pt), the special marker of our treatments in the tissues was visualized by following the intensity of the Lα-edge emission lines of Pt, mainly that at 9.45 keV which is not completely superimposed to more intense signals arising from the tissue. This emssion lines is closed to the Kβ-edge emission lines of zinc element. Data analysis with PyMCA software is still under progress for mapping all tissues and quantify the platinum. Despite the rather low concentration of CisPt (a few ppm to tens of ppm), we manage to detect and map it in the tissues (Cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>. et 1b.). We are able to distinguish the contributions of platinum and zinc. The size of the mapped zones was about 300*300 µm 2 , which is compatible with the visualization of histological details. We were able to analyze 15 samples, with one or 2 maps per sample. We analyzed one part of tissues above-cited:</p><p>-tumor section after 2h and 24h and injection of the three treatments, plus the control sample -kidney section after 2h and injection of the of the three treatments, plus the control sample -liver section after 2h and injection of the the two new treatments plus the control sample -colon tumor after oral administration of one new treatment, the commercial treatement and the control tissue</p><p>The sulphur repartition brings information about protein repartition, so, mapping of the sulphur element indicates the tissue zones. We notice that platinum is distributed everywhere in the tissue, as showed by the correlation between sulphur and platinum. There are some parts more intense of platinum correlated with the iron, indicating the tumor vascularisation.</p><p>In conclusion, we consider that this part of experiment was successfull. We can already conclude to differences of platinum concentration in the same tissues treated differently by the two types of NPs or the commercial treatment non encapsulated. We also noticed differences between tissues: more platinum is observed in kidney, compared with tumor and liver and according to the elimination of the drug. There is less platinum in liver section but more than in tumor section. We need to analyzed the other conditions above-mentioned to understand the distribution mechanisms of our new drug delivery system. With the complete experiment, our objectif is to find the other organs where platinum is distributed and compare the different treatments. a. b.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>cedric.montero@esrf.fr) Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr. Jean Doucet* (Laboratoire de Physique des Solides, univ.
