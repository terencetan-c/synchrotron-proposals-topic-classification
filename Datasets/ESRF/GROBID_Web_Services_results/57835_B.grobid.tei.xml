<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the presented experiment was to investigate the wetting and curing mechanism for metal coated micron sized polymer beads. The polymer beads were made by the Ugelstad technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> which is a method for making spherical monodisperse polymer particles. The particles used in this experiment were made of poly(methyl methacrylate) and coated with a ~90 nm thick nickel layer, and a ~20 nm thick gold layer. In addition to the metallic layers, the particles had an outer coating of SiO 2 , of thickness in the range from 0 nm to ~100 nm, depending on the particle type. The particles used in this experiment are normally used in the micro-electronics industry for making electrical contact between electrical components <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The particles are dispersed in an adhesive and smeared over the contacts. The electronic chip is then placed in an oven so the adhesive can cure at 200° C for 30 minutes.</p><p>It has previously been seen particles swell when dispersed in a liquid <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and that after the curing process has finished the spheres have fractured. It has been theorized by the manufacturer that this can be caused by swelling of the polymer in the adhesive. The main goal of this experiment was to investigate the wetting and curing mechanism, to see if the swelling could be observed and correlated to some of the preexisting defects in the metal coating.</p><p>The experimental method chosen for this experiment was 3D X-ray coherent diffraction imaging. This method is suited because it is both sensitive to the metallic coating, and the polymer core. The 3D model retrieved can be used to give accurate information of the curing process. The experimental procedure was to electrostatically stick a series of spheres on a silicon nitrate (Si 3 N 4 ) membrane and choosing a suitable particle for X-ray imaging by a light microscope. A series of scattering images was recorded by a 2 dimensional photon counter detector with the particle rotated from ~ -80° to ~ 80° around a vertical axis. These scattering images were then used as input to an iterative algorithm inverting them to a real space 3D object. The X-ray photon energy was 7.0 keV.</p><p>Several particles were imaged before any mixing of the particles with the adhesive. This was done to get a reference of what the particles look like. One of the reconstructions can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, along with one of the scattering images, demonstrating how closely the imaged particle is to a perfect sphere. The fact that it was possible to reconstruct the data is an achievement in itself, as practical experience from the beamline tells that reconstructing particles close to a perfect sphere is challenging. The projection of the particle demonstrates that the inner polymer core and the metallic coating is clearly resolved, however the resolution is not adequate to separate the two different metallic coatings. A topic of interest is that the ratio of the density of the polymer core and metal coating is too high; this is likely caused by nanopores in the metallic coating, giving it an effective lower electron density.</p><p>Another result from this dataset is that it looks like the polymer core suffers from beam damage. Parts of the polymer core have a smaller density than the rest. By inspecting the 3D model it seems like these areas of smaller density develops around preexisting holes in the metal coating. The effect of radiation damage was also measured on a pure polystyrene sphere. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows how the sphere shrinks as function of exposure time. This gives valuable input to the design of future experiments, where similar sphere will be imaged, as it gives information on how much the spheres can be exposed to the direct beam before the size and shape of the particle changes too much for the reconstruction algorithm to work (which assumes no change of the imaged particle during the beam exposures).</p><p>When mixing the particles with the adhesive, the reconstruction algorithm failed to converge to a solution. This is likely caused by a too large sample volume. When mixing the particles in the adhesive, the final object size (particle surrounded by a glue layer) was approximately 8 -10 µm in diameter.</p><p>The final set of measurements performed was raster scanning a metal coated particle in the beam, and measure the displacement of the scattering pattern, which is an indication of the wave front slopes. This lead to the possibility of reconstruction the local wave front, which turned out to be close to perfectly spherical, with a radius of curvature at the sample position equal the distance from the last beam defining slit of the optics and the sample position. This work has recently been submitted for publication to a journal.</p><p>Further analysis will be done to acquire quantitative information of the coating porosity, as well as comparing the imaged particles with particles of the same type, but with larger polymer core and metal coating thickness, to see how the length scale affects the particles.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Experiment title :</head><label>title</label><figDesc>In situ coherent diffraction imaging studies of metal-coated polymer beads in a curing epoxy adhesive Dr. Yuriy Chushkin Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Eirik Torbjørn Skjønsfjell, Nilesh Patil, Elvia Chavez Panduro, Dag W.
