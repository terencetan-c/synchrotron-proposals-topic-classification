<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Summary</head><p>A bifunctional Ni-based catalyst, Ni/MgFeAlO4, was found to be highly carbon resistant in methane dry reforming <ref type="bibr">(DRM)</ref>. As next research step, Ca was introduced for sorption functionality to make a trifunctional material, Ni/CaMgFeAlO4 for chemical looping super dry reforming. In this campaign, H2-TPR, CO2-TPO, and RWGS have been performed by means of in-situ XAS to investigate the effect of incorporated CaO on the FeOx reduction-oxidation activity, the NiFe alloy formation and to study the influence of Ni on the CO2 capacity of CaO. As Ca could unfortunately not be measured due to experimental set-up restrictions, only Ni and Fe signals have been followed. The data analysis has been started by the joint Ph.D. between LCT, Ghent, and ID20, ESRF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>The sample was diluted with fumed silica (~ 95% dilution) to get a good signal and a pellet was made for the reactor cell. To admit reaction gases, a gas feed rig with mass flow controllers and switching valves was brought by the users and installed inside the hutch, next to the appropriate gas bottles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The two main samples for in-situ investigation were: 5wt.% Ni/CaFeMgAlO4 and CaFeMgAlO4, referred to as 5NCFMA and CFMA. A pellet was placed in the reactor cell and heated to reaction temperature (~830 °C) in H2, to induce Ni-Fe alloying. After H2-TPR, CO2 was introduced (~830 °C) to follow the effect upon Ni and Fe of 1/ CO2 oxidation, 2/ CO2 sorption by CaO (transforming to CaCO3) and 3/ of subsequent CO2 desorption/CaCO3 decomposition (under inert ~830 °C). after another reduction RWGS was run with gas flow ratio H2:CO2 = 1:1 at 650 °C, followed by a temperature rise to 750 °C in He to decompose CaCO3. In all steps, Ni and Fe were followed by means of in-situ XANES (continuous scans during treatment) or EXAFS (at RT after treatment).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed and results</head><p>Fresh, reduced and oxidized states of 5NCFMA and CFMA are shown in blue, green and red, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). For both samples, a clear change in intensity of pre-edge and post-edge is observed after subsequent reduction-oxidation. After reduction, the edge is shifted towards the left, close to the Fe metal, while re-oxidation shifts it back towards the right, though not entirely to the original position. These edge positions reflect the mean oxidation state of the sample after each treatment. In addition, the white-line (WL) position and intensity change after TPR-TPO for both samples. A slight difference appears between the WL of both samples in reduced state, likely due to the presence of Ni in 5NCFMA. A Fourier transform yields the pseudo-radial distribution around the absorber (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, <ref type="figure">D</ref>), which will provide information about bond distances and neighboring ions after modelling. Reduced 5NCFMA slightly differs from CFMA around 3-4 Å, whereas the oxidized state mostly differs at ~1-2 Å, pointing to the influence of Ni. After RWGS with H2:CO2=1:1 at 650 °C, the temperature was raised to 750°C in He to decompose the formed CaCO3. The released CO2 can oxidize Fe to FeOx, which is confirmed in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. In the case of 5NCFMA, more  Concluding, we have successfully performed in-situ XAS of trifunctional materials during treatment at 830°C. The two samples examined will allow for a rigorous comparison of their behavior under reduction, CO2 oxidation, and reverse water gas shift, to assess the effect of the CaO presence. These results will be used in a publication with working title 'In-situ XAS study of trifunctional Ni-Ca-Fe materials for super dry reforming.'

At the Ni K-edge, H2-TPR reduces NiO to Ni, but CO2 re-oxidation is unable to re-oxidize Ni and this is confirmed by the obtained spectra in Fig. 4A. In case of post-RWGS treatment at 750°C, Ni remains in a reduced state, which indicates that the released CO2 during decomposition of carbonate cannot oxidize Ni.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,74.18,396.40,447.00,148.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
