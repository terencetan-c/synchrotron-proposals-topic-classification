<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During our experiment at ESRF beam ID22, we measured XRD diffractions of Cu 2 O and ZnO powders modified with different biologically originated molecules. Specific biomulecules (amino acids) and peptides in various concentrations were added during the crystallization process in order the examine their effect on the micro and nano structure of the semiconducting crystals. Our goal was to determine lattice parameters changes via measuring the diffarction peak positions and ustilizing Rietveld analysis method. Furthermore, our goal was to prove that incorporation of different biomulecules within the crystal structure of a semiconductor can be used for a technological application such as band gap engineering.</p><p>Analysing the data we collected during out stay at the ID22 we found that biomulecules incorporated into Cu 2 O structure similar to ZnO, indeed, have a strong effect on the lattice parameters caused by intracrystalline strain. This result can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, presenting the most intense (111) peak ( contrast to the previously observed lattice expansion caused by intracrystalline such a negative lattice dsitortions upon incorporation we observed for the first time. Utilizing Rietveld method we extracted lattice parameters for all the investigated samples and calculated corresponding lattice distrotions for every sample.

The experiment was performed within the temperature range of 50°C-300°C. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents the (111) diffraction peak evolution of pure Cu 2 O crystals and Cu 2 O/Gln composite crystals after a heat treatment. Only a rather slight lattice expansion over the temperature and no considerable peak shift were detected after thermal annealing of the control sample (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). In contrast, the revealed relaxation behaviour observed for the Cu 2 O/Gln composite indicated that the lattice distortions were continuously-relaxing due to organics are burnt out during the stepwise increase of the applied temperature. In addition, the lattice relaxation already commenced at 75°C and its highest rate was found between 100°C and 150°C. A full relaxation of distortions was observed above 225°C which signifies a complete decomposition of the intracrystalline organic phase (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>: Evolution of (111) reflections for A) Cu 2 O control sample and B) Cu 2 O crystals after incorporation of Gln recorded during different stages of the in-situ heat treatment experiment carried out within temperature range from 50°C (dashed light blue) and up to 300°C (dashed brown) with a step rate of 25°C.

The temperature variation of the relaxation time parameter 𝜏 is given by an Arrhenius type relation: 𝜏 𝑇 = 𝜏 ! exp (𝛥𝐸 ! /𝑅𝑇), where 𝜏 ! represents the relaxation time at infinite temperature (preexponential factor), 𝛥𝐸 ! the activation energy of the relaxation process, 𝑅 = 8.314 J mol -1 K -1 is the universal gas constant. The activation energy for lattice relaxation calculated from the slope of a linear fit to these data is about 0.23eV. Considering that the activation energy of protein unfolding is known to be in the range of 0.1 -1 eV, the obtained reasonably low value we attribute to the thermal decomposition of intracrystalline organic matter occurring under mild heat treatments and leading to the lattice relaxation.</p><p>Moreover, previous study conducted on biogenic aragonitic shells reports the activation energy of 0.31eV for the temperature-induced lattice relaxation originating from the destruction of the occluded organic macromolecules. The latter reasoning strengthens the idea that the lattice relaxations along the a,b,c-axes of the Cu 2 O unit cell observed under mild heat treatments arises exclusively due to the disruption of organic inclusions.</p><p>2.435 2.440 2.445 2.450 2.455 2.460 2.465 2.470 2.475 2.480 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Intensity normalized d-spacings [Å] Gln-RT 50°C 75°C 100°C 125°C 150°C 175°C 200C 250°C 300°C Control</p><p>(111) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 -7.0x10 -3 -6.0x10 -3 -5.0x10 -3 -4.0x10 -3 -3.0x10 -3 -2.0x10 -3 -1.0x10 -3 0.0 Lattice distortions relaxation, % Temperature, °C Lattice distortions 0 20 40 60 80 100 a b</p><p>In conlusion, accurate measurements of the structural parameters in bio-inspired semiconductor crystals conducted at ID22 will allow us further to learn how the chemical structure and the length of the incorporated biomolecules affects the semiconductor's crystal structure and band gap. Utilizing the obtained results we do hope to decipher the mechanism of band gap change due to such incorporation. Moreover, for better understanding of the incorporation of biomolecules inside the crystal structure, an accurate concentration measurement of intracrystalline molecules needs to be further performed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1 that diffraction peaks returned to the original position (indicated by pure Cu 2 O sample) after a mild heat treatment at 250°C due to strain release caused by amino acid destruction.
