<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The NAC domain (residues 1-168) of ANAC, encoded by the abscisic acid responsive NAC gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, was recombinantly produced in E. coli and crystallized in hanging drops. Three morphologically different crystal forms were obtained within a relatively narrow range of conditions: 10-15% PEG4000, 0.1 M imidazole/malic acid buffer pH 7.0 in the reservoir, 3.2-7.7 mg ml -1 in the protein stocks, and 1:1 ratio of reservoir to protein solution in the hanging drop. One of the crystal forms, designated crystal form III, was found to be suitable for further X-ray analysis. Form III crystals belong to space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with unit cell parameters a = 62.0 Å, b = 75.2 Å and c = 80.8 Å at 100 K. The cell volume is consistent with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and a peak in the native Patterson map suggests the presence of a non-crystallographic two-fold axis parallel to a crystallographic axis. Size exclusion chromatography of the NAC domain showed that the dimeric state is also the preferred one in solution, and probably represents the biologically active form. Data sets from four potential heavy atom derivatives of the form III crystals were collected. The derivatized crystals are reasonably isomorphous with the non-derivatized crystals and the four data sets are being evaluated for use in structure determination by Multiple Isomorphous Replacement.</p></div>

Ernst* Eva Johansson* Report:</p><p>A report has already been submitted for the projects contained in the original application. However during the allocated shifts for MX93 some data was collected on one of the projects described in proposal MX170. At the time of application for MX170 we had not yet collected data for the present proposal MX93, hence we could not know that the time available at ID29 could cover both projects.</p><p>Heavy atom derivatives data was collected for crystals of the NAC binding domain of Arabidopsis ANAC. ANAC belongs to a large family of plant specific transcription factors. The data collected at ID29 has allowed structure determination and resulted in an article describing crystallization (Olsen et al in press) and a manuscript describing the structure <ref type="bibr">(Ernst et al., submitted)</ref>.
