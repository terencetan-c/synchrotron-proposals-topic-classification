Golinelli (1.5 shift) : Structure of the hemic domain of flavocytochrome b2 complexed with an Fab fragment</p><p>Flavocytochrome b 2 catalyses the oxydation of lactate to pyruvate. This enzyme is composed of two domains : the flavodeshydrogenase that contains the flavine mononucleotide and the heme domain. In order to understand the mechanism of electron transfer and to know if the mobility of the heme domain is necessary for catalysis (Miles et al., <ref type="bibr">Biochemistry, 1998, 37, 3340)</ref>, we crystallized the heme domain in complex with the Fab fragment of an antibody that hinders the intramolecular electron transfer between the flavin and the heme b 2 . A full data set (95.9 % complete) of the complex has been recorded at 3.2 Å resolution. The space group is P21 with a unit cell of a=73.0 Å, b=85.6 Å, c=91.5 Å, α=90 β=97.4 γ=90, R sym =16.3 % (42.4 % in the 3.31-3.2 Å resolution shell ). The molecular replacement search positions the constant domain and the variable domain for the two Fabs in the asymmetric unit. Refinement is in progress to locate the two copies of the heme domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T. Bizebard (0.5 shift) : Structural study of Ribonuclease E</head><p>Ribonuclease E (RNase E) is an essential E.coli endoribonuclease and is evolutionarily conserved in many other bacteria. In E.coli the protein fulfils at least two important functions: it is necessary for the maturation of stable RNAs (5S ribosomal RNA and tRNAs) and it has a key role in the degradation of most messenger RNAs -thus making a very important contribution to the overall regulation of genetic expression.</p><p>Although this enzyme has been extensively studied, nothing is known about its structure and enzymatic mechanism. In the past, structural studies of RNase E have been hampered by the lack of stability and solubility of this protein; to try to overcome these problems, we have decided to work with a fragment of the protein which retains the catalytic activity of the full-length enzyme and is much easier to manipulate. This fragment has been overexpressed, purified, submitted to crystallisation trials and small crystals have recently been obtained.</p><p>These crystals tested showed no diffraction spots were observed beyond 7 Å resolution; this crystalline form is thus unsuitable for structural studies; additional crystallisation trials are underway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Herman Van Tilbeurgh, Nicolas Leuliot (1 shift) : Structure determination of proteins from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome</head><p>During the last shift of the proposal number LS2072 on BM30 on 05/07/07 we started to collect data sets for the structural genomics project on yeast target proteins. The data collection was continued on 05-06/07/02 on BM30 with the french CRG beam time allocation (to see the BM30 experiment report corresponding to the proposal number 30-01-514). The systematic names of the genes are used. More details on every orf can be found on <ref type="url" target="http://genomics.eu.org/targets.html">http://genomics.eu.org/targets.html</ref>. We started during the LS2072 shift with orf YDR435c ( target 182). Spacegroup P6122 or P6522 a=112.7 c= 162.7 RESOLUTION = 2.0 A This orf codes for a N-terminal methyl transferase involved in the regulation of a phosphatase complex. There are no structural models for this protein, so the structure has to be solved by MAD or MIR. Se met data were collected on beamline ID14 one week before and we are in the stage of phasing the protein. During our time on BM30, complete data sets on the native protein with and without a potential cosubstrate were collected. The good quality of the native data at 2.0A resolution will allow to refine the structure accurately.</p></div>		</body>
