<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of beamtime MA-4791 (and the following in-house time) was to investigate multiple aspects of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) based CO 2 electrolysis (CO 2 E). The results obtained from this work will be used to understand the mechanisms behind changes in product selectivity over time. For this purpose, a special electrolysis cell was developed in a collaboration between ESRF ID31 staff and DTU Physics. The cell was thoroughly tested at DTU for electrochemical performance. The first step during the beam was to familiarize, align, and calibrate the cell along with the different components from an X-ray imaging and diffraction perspective. Hereafter, a series of in-operando experiments were performed in order to investigate the following:</p><p>1. Initial native copper oxide (CuO) reduction to Cu 2. Variation in water content of the cathode catalyst and gas diffusion layer during electrolysis operation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Transformation in catalyst morphology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell testing:</head><p>The cell is an MEA type electrolysis cell designed with a casing sufficiently X-ray transparent to execute inoperando investigations of the MEA itself. The MEA is an assembly of two gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) directly in contact with each side of an anion exchange membrane (AEM). In all experiments, the cathode GDE contained a 150 nm sputtered copper catalyst layer, and the anode was a commercial IrO 2 coated GDE. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a completely assembled CO 2 electrolyzer so that the cathode flow channel was parallel to the beam axis (i.e. in-plane axis), which allowed for the quantification of the transient catalyst morphology (and oxidation) cathode GDE water content. We used the first two shifts for initial alignments of the cell and took reference XRD patterns to identify the different parts of the cell in the absence of current. The cell performance was good and from the diffraction patterns, it was easy to differentiate the different components of the cell, including flow-fields, catalysts, membrane, etc. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CuO reduction:</head><p>The surface of the Cu catalyst will unavoidably oxidize during the manufacturing and handling in an air/oxygen environment, and it has been discussed 1 if this oxide layer was important to the performance of the catalyst. Therefore, the first thing investigated was the reduction of the initial native copper oxide (Cu 2 O) layer. As the crystal structure of Cu 2 O and Cu is different, the reduction process can be observed as a change in the diffracted pattern. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the integrated WAXS patterns and the time when the potential was turned on or when CO 2 E was started. Most notably, the Cu 2 O peak around 4.2 degrees visibly diminishes within the first 20-30 s. A similar fast reduction of the initial Cu 2 O was observed for multiple experiments. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Water management:</head><p>It is expected that water (electrolyte) flooding of the catalyst layer and the GDE impacts cell performance significantly, therefore, a series of in-operando experiments were performed at varying current densities. A total of 9 (3 h) experiments were successfully performed, and the preliminary data analysis indicates a correlation between cell potential and water content in the cathode gas diffusion layer. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows one example where the water content has been estimated by integrating the scattered X-rays in an appropriate section of q-values where only a few Bragg peaks (mainly Cu) are present. The y-axis is the position normal to the MEA plane, ranging from the membrane at 0 and far into the GDE at position 50. The high-intensity strip around saz2 position 10-20 is the Cu catalyst layer. It can be seen that at the top of GDE, the intensity of the signal increases with time, and towards the end of the experiment, the signal, i.e. water content, fluctuates. Furthermore, it was observed that these fluctuations correlate with potential changes. The gas analysis data from the gas chromatograph (GC) and mass spectrometrometer (MS) shows a similar fluctuation in selectivity, with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) being the primary reaction when the cell is flooded. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Catalyst morphology</head><p>The morphology of the catalysts layer was continuously investigated using SAXS, but our preliminary analysis of the data does not show any indication of changes. As the catalyst used was sputtered Cu, we did not expect to observe any significant change in morphology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Our experiments clarified the timeframe in which the initial Cu 2 O layer reduces during CO 2 E. Additionally, a large amount of experiments shows the correlation between water content in the cathode GDE and the cell potential of the CO 2 electrolyzer. An increase in water content at the cathode GDE also correlates with the increase in hydrogen evolution reaction. Additionally, the catalyst morphology was analyzed and did not show any significant change. In general, the results from the beamtime are highly satisfactory and the quality of our data is excellent. We expect to publish at least two scientific articles based on the obtained results and hope that the work can be continued in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
