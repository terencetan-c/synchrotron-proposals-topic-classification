<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the proposal, we indicated how we were planning to image mouse liver for future vasculature investigation. Several imaging acquisition parameters were given for good quality imaging based on a first attempt to image mouse liver using phase contrast imaging with Synchrotron radiation on ID19. Among those acquisition parameters, we had identified: energy (26 keV), propagation distance (3 m), high photon flux and voxel size (3,5 µm). Not indicated in the proposal, the beam dimensions is also a critical parameters as it can affect the duration of the scan. On a previous test, beam dimensions was approximately (16 x 16 x 10 mm). Several parameters on ID17 for LS2830 (29/10/2018-30/10/2018) have not been completely fulfilled in regard with the ones stated before. The combination of all those factors has lead to a total number of 6 samples scanned (on a total amount of 15 samples). For further improvements on the beamline, we can list it below:</p><p>• Energy: Ideal energy range to observe soft tissues such as hepatic tissues can be considered to be between 19 and 26 keV. On ID17, we could not be under 34 keV without decreasing significantly beam quality.</p><p>• Beam dimensions: As stated before, in our application, ideal beam dimensions are (16 x 16 x 10 mm). With ID17 conditions on 29th October, the best we could get was (16x16x3,4 mm). Those dimensions have increasing the number of scans for each sample (10 scans for each sample). When we stated 10 minutes for each sample in the proposal (3 scans of 3minutes), in those conditions, this scanning time has increased to 120 minutes for each sample (10 scans of 12 minutes).</p><p>• Interface loss: During the night (around midnight), we have lost control of the MEDTOMO interface. Impossible without appropriate knowledge to relaunch it, which has lead to an early abortion of the experiment (estimated beam loss: 8 hours).</p><p>As stated in the introduction of this form, we have been able to image 6 mouse livers in different pathological conditions <ref type="bibr">(healthy, fibrotic, cirrhotic)</ref>. Those data, even with a more complex post-processing, due to their poor quality (low SNR, motion blur, nearly no signal at the edge of the sample, etc.) did not allow us to extract any information about the hepatic vasculature. To illustrate those conditions, we have selected significant and representative snapshots from the data reconstruction we made. As no information nor any added value could have been extracted from those data, we hope, a further beamtime disposal could be offered to us in order to simply respect what we have declared as our goal in the original proposal. Samples are still stored in optimal conditions and there is no limitation to image it a second time for the 6 we have already imaged and a first time for the ones we could not have imaged back in october 2018.</p><p>Illustration 1: Three different slices from 3D phase contrast tomography of three different samples</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,34.00,190.36,232.90,231.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
