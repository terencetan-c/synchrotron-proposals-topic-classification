<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In acidic soils, sulphate can be retained by adsorption to pedogenic minerals such as Al and Fe oxyhydroxides and by precipitation of Al or Fe (oxy) hydroxy sulphate minerals, such as jurbanite, basaluminite, alunite, or jarosite (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Nordstrom, 1982)</ref>. However, the contribution of precipitation and adsorption processes to the physico-chemical retention of sulphate in acid soils with different chemical environment is still unclear and a matter of an ongoing scientific debate (e.g. <ref type="bibr">Wolt et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Delfosse et al., 2005)</ref>. Since both processes are different with respect to (i) their kinetics, (ii) the presence or absence of a SO 4 2-retention capacity limit, and (iii) the reversibility of the formation reaction, a correct assessment of the S retention capacity of a soil and a reliable prediction of soil S pool changes under changing environmental conditions requires knowledge about the form in which S is retained in a soil.</p><p>Sulphate adsorption occurs on the surfaces of various soil minerals, such as ferrihydrite (Fe 5 HO 8 * 4 H 2 O), goethite (α-FeOOH), hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ) and gibbsite (α-Al(OH) 3 ). In contrast to pure, well-crystallized Al and Fe hydroxy sulphate minerals which can be identified by XRD, particularly Al hydroxy sulphate minerals precipitated in soils are often amorphous, and closely associated to other minerals. Thus a direct proof of their existence in soils is almost impossible. In most studies, the presence of Al and Fe hydroxy sulphate minerals in soil environments was concluded on the basis of the ionic composition of the soil solution, using thermodynamic considerations <ref type="bibr">(Nordstrom, 1982)</ref>, or by comparing the amount of SO 4 2-that can be mobilized from the soil with different extractants which had been tested for their ability to dissolve Al hydroxy sulphate minerals <ref type="bibr">(Prietzel and Hirsch, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Delfosse et al., 2005)</ref>. Hesterberg et al. <ref type="bibr">(1999)</ref> showed that phosphate adsorbed to Al and Fe oxyhydroxides can be distinguished from phosphate minerals and precipitated phosphate by P K-edge XANES. Since sulfate and phosphate both are oxyanions and behave similarly in soil systems, it was hypothesized that also sulfate adsorbed to Al and Fe oxyhydroxides in soils could be distinguished from precipitated sulfate by S K-edge XANES.</p><p>The S K-edge XANES spectra of different sulfate salts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) all show one ore two distinct post-edge peaks in the 2490-2500 eV region in addition to the white-line at 2482 eV which is indicative for the S(VI) in sulfate. The white-line signal in these compounds generally is about 3 to 4 times stronger than the post-edge signal. The same is true for the Al hydroxy sulfates alunite and basaluminite, and the Fe hydroxy sulfates jarosite and schwertmannite (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). In contrast sulfate adsorbed to gibbsite, goethite, ferrihydrite, and hematite shows only very weak post-edge features, with the signal intensity being less than 10% of that of the white-line peak (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). An investigation of subsoil (B) horizons of various German forest soils with different parent materials and different levels of atmospheric S deposition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>) showed that the sulfate in most soils was adsorbed rather than precipitated sulfate. Precipiated CaSO 4 was detected in the Kyffhäuser soil, whose bedrock is pure gypsum, and in a grain in the soil Eichstätt. For the acid soils Selb, Alzenau, and Waldidylle, which all have been subject to high atmospheric S deposition in recent decades, the sulfate obviously is entirely adsorbed, and Al hydroxy sulfates are not present. Our results show that S K-edge XANES allows to identify adsorbed and precipitated sulfate in soils. -2 3 2450 2470 2490 2510 2530 Energy /eV Absorption /a.u. a) CaSO4 Al 2 (SO4 ) 3 Fe 2 (SO4 ) 3 Na 2 SO 4 MnSO 4 -2 3 8 13 2450 2470 2490 2510 2530 Energy /eV Absorption /a.u. b) Schwertmannite K alunite Basaluminite Jarosite Na alunite -1 4 9 14 19 24 2450 2470 2490 2510 2530 Energy /eV Absorption /a.u. d) Kyffhäuser Eichstätt grain Zwiesel Waldidylle Alzenau Stalldorf Eichstätt Selb -4.5 0.5 5.5 10.5 15.5 2450 2470 2490 2510 2530 Energy /eV Absorption /a.u. c) Ferrihydrite + SO4 Hematite + SO4 Gibbsite + SO4 Goethite + SO4</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: S K-edge spectra of (a) sulfate salts, (b) Al and Fe hydroxy sulfates, (c) sulfate adsorbed to Al and Fe oxyhydroxides, and (d) B and C horizons of soils with different parent material and S deposition.</figDesc></figure>
