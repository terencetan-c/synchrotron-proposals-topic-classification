<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report</head><p>The aim of the proposal was to image the skulls of exceptional three-dimensionally preserved early teleost fossils in order to better understand phylogenetic relationships and macroevolutionary patterns. We succesfully imaged 34 specimens during this experiment, using 3 different detector setups (generating data with 8, 12 and 20 Âµm voxel size respectively), for a total of 676 scans.</p><p>The experimental plan had to be adjusted during the experiment as the sample stage suffered a hardware failure. As a result, the translation motor which is used to move the stage laterally could not be used, making it impossible to perform so called half acquisition computed tomography, where an offset is applied on the centre of rotation to double the reconstructed field of view. This problem was circumvented for the most critical specimens, performing 2 acquisitions side by side that were concatenated later.</p><p>To prepare the data for computed tomography reconstruction, the position of the centre of rotation has to be indicated. Unexpectedly, this process that is normally automatised, had to be done manually for most of the datasets acquired afer the sample stage failure. This extra step delayed the reconstruction of the data by several weeks. Once this was finally done, we proceeded with the other steps, comprising the tomographic reconstruction and any data processing necessary to correct for potential artefact (e.g., ring correction). Further IT hardware issues on the part of the users caused further delays, and the transfer of all datasets was completed in Spring 2022.</p><p>During the data processing, datasets representing the same specimen had to be merged: as the specimens were much larger than the vertical field of view (i.e., vertical beam size of 4 mm), each specimen required between 4 and 65 scans to cover it completely.</p><p>As mentioned above, a lateral concatenation was necessary for 3 of the specimens: the right and left side of these specimen were scanned separately and had to be merged to create a single dataset that could be studied. Tools to perform this process were existing at the ESRF but required some hands-on processing to achieve the desired results.</p><p>Processing of the data was delayed due to ill health and subsequent leave of a project team members, so analysis and description of the data is still ongoing. As segmentation of fossil data is time consuming and will take several months to complete, the details of the confidential data are omitted. However, data form ESRF scans will form the bulk of at least two thesis chapters for Jake Atterby's PhD. These scans have produced significant results relating to the braincase and endocast, as well as unprecedented insight into tooth histology. The data will also contribute to at least five distinct manuscripts: two on anatomy and relationships of early teleost groups, one on exceptional soft tissue preservation, one on dental morphology, and one on early vertebrate relationships. Other datasets will support undergraduate research projects in the next academic year.</p><p>Scanning of four specimens of the late Permian taxon Acentrophorus was ultimately unsuccessful. This was largely due to a lack of contrast between the fossil and the matrix, and also the highly compressed nature of the specimens. As a result, these scans yield very little insight into the anatomy of Acentrophorus and are unlikely to be segmentable or publishable. Scans of some specimens also revealed that internal structures were not preserved and therefore the material is not suitable for further study</p></div>		</body>
