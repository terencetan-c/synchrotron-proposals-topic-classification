<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Airway closure and oxygen reabsorption as causes of atelectasis during general anesthesia Experiment number:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MD-658</head><p>Beamline:</p><p>ID 17 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The authors performed a functional study using K-edge subtraction (KES) method followed by a second stage using FReLoN detector at 47 microns resolution. The experiments were performed in 11 New Zealand rabbits divided in two groups: 7 rabbits were studied with KES and 4 rabbits using FReLoN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Low resolution and K-edge subtraction (KES) setting</head><p>All the animals were kept alive until the end of images acquisition, mechanically ventilated and exposed to both FiO 2 of 21% and 100%. First the rabbits were subjected to a procedure aimed at standardizing lung volume and diaphragm position in upright posture. After recruitment maneuvers, at each FiO 2 condition, two different PEEP values (12 and 0 cmH 2 O) were applied. For each condition, rabbits were exposed at a multislice image acquisition (for a thickness of 3 cm, from the middle to the caudal chest) was obtained. For each condition Xenon wash-in images were acquired to measure regional lung ventilation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Radiation microtomography (SR µCT) setting</head><p>In this phase the Fast Readout Low Noise detector with a spatial resolution of 46.6 microns was used.</p><p>Because the readout of the FReLoN detector can have motion artifacts in alive animals, generating blurred images, it was necessary to avoid chest wall motion and vascular pulsatility. For this purpose, we moved to a post-mortem experiment; we lowered the body temperature putting a cold gel pad around the abdomen in order to delay rigor mortis. The computer-controlled system synchronized imaging with the different phases of mechanical ventilation, to reduce motion artifacts. The animals underwent to different PEEP levels: 12, 8, 4, 0 cmH 2 O.</p><p>In our preliminary data analysis, we generated high-resolution maps (with a pixel size of 47 microns) of tissue density distribution using scripts for the Image Processing Toolbox for MatLab R2008a (MatLab, The MathWorks, Natick, MA).</p><p>By this method we obtained the voxel densities and their distribution within the lung parenchima. During the image-processing, the lung parenchyma of the CT slices was manually outlined. The mean density of the lung was assessed and compared between the different ventilator settings. (see attached figures)</p><p>The experiments were successful and proved the applicability of high-resolution SRCT to imaging of lung parenchyma. Work is still in progress to extract quantitative parameters of respiratory mechanics: they will allow to better understand the onset of airway closure phenomena and intrinsic heterogeneity of parenchyma, even in healthy lungs, when subjected to invasive mechanical ventilation. The data will be fully analyzed and published later</p></div>			</div>
