<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract: Human IgG4 antibody shows therapeutically-useful properties compared to the IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 subclasses. Thus IgG4 does not activate complement, and shows conformational variability. These properties are attributable to its hinge region, which is the shortest of the four IgG subclasses. Using high throughput scattering methods, we have studied the solution structure of wild-type IgG4(Ser222) and a hinge mutant IgG4(Pro222) in different buffers and temperatures, where the proline substitution suppresses the formation of half-antibody. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that both IgG4 forms were principally monomeric with sedimentation coefficients s 0 20,w of 6.6-6.8 S. A monomer-dimer equilibrium was observed in heavy water buffer at low temperature. Scattering showed that the X-ray radius of gyration R G was unchanged with concentration in 50-250 mM NaCl buffers, while the neutron R G values showed a concentration-dependent increase as the temperature decreased in heavy water buffers. The distance distribution curves P(r) revealed two peaks, M1 and M2 that shifted below 2 mg/ml to indicate concentrationdependent IgG4 structures, in addition to IgG4 dimer formation at high concentration in heavy water.</p><p>Constrained X-ray and neutron scattering modelling revealed asymmetric solution structures for IgG4(Ser222) with extended hinge structures. The IgG4(Pro222) structure was similar. Both IgG4 structures showed that their Fab regions were positioned close enough to the Fc region to restrict C1q binding. Our new molecular models for IgG4 explain its inability to activate complement, and clarifies aspects of its stability and function for therapeutic applications.</p><p>(2) Publication: Hui, G.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manuscript in preparation.</head><p>Abstract: Human IgG1 antibody shows distinct and therapeutically-useful properties compared to the IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 antibody subclasses. IgG1 is the most well studied and exploited subclass for the development of therapeutic antibodies due to numerous characteristics. It is the most abundant subclass, it has the longest plasma half-life and multifunctional as it can bind every type of human FcγR and can activate the complement cascade. Although it is the most-well understood antibody, only limited structural information is available for this due to the hinge flexibility between its Fab and Fc regions. Here, we have studied the solution structure of two different full-sized human IgG1 molecules IgG1 6a and IgG1 19a in different buffers and temperatures. By analytical ultracentrifugation, both IgG1 6a and IgG1 19a were principally monomeric with sedimentation coefficient s 0 20,w values of 6.4 S and 6.3 S respectively. IgG1 dimer formation is minor and does not dependent on the buffer conditions. By solution scattering, the X-ray radius of gyration R G values increased with salt concentration in different buffers, while the neutron R G values remained unchanged with increase in temperature. The X-ray and neutron distance distribution curves P(r) revealed two peaks, M1 and M2, that reflect the separation between the Fab and Fc regions. Since their positions remained unchanged, this indicated that the IgG1 structure is stable in different buffers. Constrained scattering modelling revealed predominantly asymmetric solution structures for both IgG1 6a and IgG1 19a with mostly extended hinge structures. Both IgG1 structures showed T-and Y-shaped conformations with the Fab regions suitably positioned to allow enough space for the Fc region to bind to its ligands such as C1q and FcγR without steric clashes. This outcoem is distinct from that for human IgG4. These IgG1 models validate the crystal structure of intact human IgG1. Our new molecular models for IgG1 explain its attributes to activate complement, and will facilitate further studies of its stability and function for therapeutic applications. This project is completed. We expect that this will be shortly submitted for publication..</p></div>			</div>
