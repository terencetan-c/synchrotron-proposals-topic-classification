<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>ASAXS study of the influence of the critical steps of the catalyst synthesis on oxide precursor phase and sulfide slabs multiscale Mo organization The aim of this study, which was an integral part of C. Cottrez's thesis, was to lead to a detailed description of the multi-scale structure of hydrotreatment catalysts, based on molybdenum sulfide supported on alumina, and synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation. First, these results should help to evaluate the role of synthesis steps as ageing, drying or either additivation, onto the arrangement of the sulfides slabs. These knowledges should then allow to elucidate the genesis of Mo aggregates and establish a relationship between the sulfide phase multi-scale repartition, its accessibility, and the intrinsic activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and preliminary conclusions of the study:</head><p>36 catalysts were analyzed, varying: the loading of molybdenum oxide (from 18 to 30% wt), the presence of organic additives (with/without), the presence of an ageing step (with/without), and the drying parameters. ASAXS experimentations were recorded slightly below the Mo K-edge, at 5 different energies <ref type="bibr">: 19700, 19860, 19940, 19975, 19990</ref> eV. As we wanted the largest q-domain as possible (typically between 10 -2 and 1 A -1 ), two detector/sample distances were used (3m and 35cm). As a first step, the curves of intensity measured for the 5 energies were subtracted two by two in order to obtain the intensity scattered by the sulfide slabs and to eliminate the contribution of the porous support <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Information obtained from the ASAXS data can be divided into two parts through the q-scale: (i) the large q that are related to the scale of the slabs: the intensity depends on the size of the slabs and on their stacking, (ii) the low q that are related to the cluster/aggregate of the slabs. The comparison of the ASAXS curves already give qualitative information but preliminary data exploitations have also been done for the last three months, but this work is underway and must continue. Few examples are presented below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>First results</head><p>-Effect of ageing step: Three different catalysts are compared to assess as a first sight the effect of the ageing step:</p><p>-A 26%Mo-catalyst subjected to an 8h-ageing, then dried -A 26%Mo-catalyst with no ageing step, followed by a necessary freeze-drying step -A 26%Mo-catalyst subjected to an 8h-ageing and then freeze-dried The ASAXS curves obtained on the three catalysts are reported on figure 1. Significant differences can be observed for both isolated slabs and clusters of sulfide slabs. At smaller scale, the ageing step leads to taller slabs (2.7 nm versus 1.8 nm). At larger scale, the ageing step might tend to obtain larger aggregates (9 nm versus 7.7 nm). To rule out the effect of the freeze-drying step, the aged catalysts dried and freeze-dried can also be compared. It appears that the shape of both curves is very similar and differences in terms of slabs length and aggregates size are much smaller. Therefore, we might affirm that the ageing effect is predominant on the Mo organization compared to the freeze-drying effect.</p><p>-Influence of %Mo aggregated onto the intrinsic activity: As a first approach, the intrinsic activity was faced to the amount of molybdenum involved into aggregates (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), since this relationship had been observed in a previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It seems that this relationship is indeed verified for many catalysts that have undergone post-additivation, freeze-drying (with or without an ageing step). However, these results remain preliminary and need to be consolidated. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pesrpectives</head><p>Exploitation of the data needs to be continued and finalized. ASAXS technique is totally suitable to characterize the sulfide active phase of this kind of catalyst as it gives crucial information on the size of the slabs and aggregates. It is crucial for C. Cottrez's thesis project as it allows studying the influence of each synthesis step on the catalyst active phase arrangement. Furthermore, it is now necessary to study the influence of the impregnation step through different impregnation modes (incipient wetness with successive impregnation steps or with different solution viscosity, impregnation by equilibrium adsorption, or impregnation by melt infiltration). This additional investigation will complete the study of the complete chain of the catalyst synthesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments about the use of beam time:</head><p>The 1 st session (2 shifts) was used to set up the beamline and the acquisition conditions at long detector/sample distance. The 2 nd session was used to record the data. The 3 rd session consisted in changing manually the distance (2 shifts). The fourth session has consisted in recording the data at this short distance. This global beamtime was necessary to success recording good data as the anomalous experiments with 5 different energies is not trivial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publication(s):</head><p>These valuable results will undoubtedly be the subject of a future publication.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>9</head><figDesc>Local contact(s): DE GEUSER FredericReceived at ESRF:Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
