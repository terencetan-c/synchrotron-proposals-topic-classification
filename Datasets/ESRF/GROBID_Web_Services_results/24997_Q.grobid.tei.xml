<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Small RNA phages, belonging to the family Leviviridae have been used extensively as models for studies of various problems in molecular biology, including protein-RNA interactions, repression of translation, virus assembly and virus evolution. The capsids of small RNA phages have T=3 symmetry and can be regarded as built up from 90 dimers. Dimers of the viral coat protein bind to a specific site on the viral RNA. This binding is thought to be the initiation of assembly, and the specificity in the binding leads to encapsidation of the correct RNA molecule. The binding is also used in regulation of the expression of the replicase gene. The coat protein acts as a repressor of the translation of this gene. The coat protein dimer binds to a stem-loop structure including the initiation codon of the gene. This binding is very specific and coat protein from one phages species normally do not recognize RNA from other similar phages. The three dimensional structure of bacteriophage MS2 has been determined earlier. The genomic RNA is invisible in the crystal structure of native MS2 since upon crystallization particles will have different orientations. Also, in native phage the specific coat protein -RNA interaction occurs only in one place per casid. However, the MS2 crystals of recombinant, "empty" capsids can be soaked in mother liquor, containing RNA stem-loop fragments. The RNA then diffuse inside the capsids and binds to all (or most) of 90 equivalent binding sites. The three dimensional structure of bacteriophage MS2 coat protein in complex with its native RNA binding fragment has been determined earlier using the method described above. Our collaborators have earlier isolated MS2 coat protein mutants, capable to bind RNA of anoter small RNA phage Qb with 1,000-fold stronger affinity than wild-type MS2 coat protein.</p><p>We collected a single 2.8Ã… dataset of MS2 mutant coat protein crystals, soaked with RNA fragment from another small RNA phage Qb. The solved structure confirmed the presence of Qb RNA and provided some explanations of why mutant coat protein has stronger affinity to Qb RNA. As already expected from basepairing predictions, there are three nucleotides in the loop, compared to four nucleotides in MS2 RNA. It also appears that RNA stem is able to form two distinct conformations with and without a buldge. One of the mutated residues N87A leaves more space for the purine base in Qb RNA, explaining increased affinity. Other mutation E89K eliminates negative charge repulsions between aspartate and RNA phosphate. At present, structure is refined and writing of the paper is in progress.</p></div>		</body>
