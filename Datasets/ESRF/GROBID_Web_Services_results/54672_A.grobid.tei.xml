<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results</head><p>Fourteen samples were measured during the experiment with different temperature cycles. The heating and cooling programs of the later samples were selected basing on the premilinary data analysis of the previous ones. For the high temperature experiments, the powders were contained in borosilicate glass capillaries with 1 mm in diameter prepared under helium atmosphere to avoid oxidation, the heating up process was provided by hot air blower.</p><p>High resolution X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from synchrotron radiations have precisely shown the peak positions of different HMS compounds, as well as small amounts of present impurities, usually hindered by the high background of conventional X-ray instruments due to the existence of manganese. An example was given in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, showing the major phase of HMS and a tiny peak of Si (estimated to be less than 1 at.-%). It is noticed that no significant chemical decompositions are observed over the whole temperature range. Le Bail refinements are performed by fitting the experimental patterns with the theoretical ones of the sublattices of manganese and silicon to obtain the cell parameters and the ratios c Mn /c Si of these sublattices. These ratios help to predict the compositions of different HMS compounds. The stoichiometry is identified to correspond to Mn 15 Si 26 at room temperature for all the investigated samples.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Typical diffraction pattern recorded from MnSi 1.75 stoichiometry with a tiny peak of silicon (estimated to be less than 1 at.-%)</p><p>The manganese and silicon subcells are expanded with increasing temperatures due to thermal agitations at atomic levels with different magnitudes, leading to changing the c Mn /c Si ratios. The modifications depend on the nominal compositions of the materials. Generally, this ratio increases with elevated temperatures up to a saturated value of approximately 1.736, then decrease with further heating for the samples containing only manganese and silicon, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for the sample with nominal compositions of MnSi 1.75 . The saturating temperatures are less than 700ºC for all the samples and decrease with increasing the amount of silicon. Unfortunately, the cooling cycle show poor reproducibility of these ratios; the reason is suggested to be the presence of impurities (manganese monosilicide MnSi or silicon).</p><p>The phase transitions are predicted to happened after the saturating points due to intolerant disturbance of the structures at high temperature. Due to limited time for experiments, the doped samples were either measured only at room temperature or heated up to less than 700ºC. Germanium, aluminum, and chromium are inserted into the structure of HMS, while molybdenum disilicide MoSi 2 is identified as impurity due to the large size of molybdenum. At room temperature, the predicted compound for Ge-doped HMS is Mn 11 Si 19 , and for the others still is Mn 15 Si 26 . The temperature dependence shows clear dependence on the doping types. With germanium (Figure 3 (a)) and chromium as dopants, the ratio increases with increasing temperature, but has not reached the saturated point yet in this temperature range. On the other hand, the Al-doped HMS (Figure 3 (b)) show a decreasing trend of this ratio with increasing temperature. 3. Conclusions (a) MnSi 1.73 Ge 0.02 (b) MnSi 1.73 Al 0.02</p><p>The experiments allowed us to predict the actual compositions of HMS, and the dependences on temperature and dopants. The achieved results help to optimize the synthesis and measurement conditions for future experiments to improve the thermoelectric performance of HMS-based materials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>The objectives of the ThermoMag Integrated Project within the EU 7th Framework Program is to develop and deliver new energy harvesting thermoelectric (TE) materials based on abundant and ecologically friendly elements, for example magnesium silicide Mg 2 Si and Higher Manganese Silicides (HMS) MnSi γ (γ = 1.71-1.75). The band gap and density of states near Fermi level, which are responsible for thermoelectric properties of HMS, depend on their actual compositions, which were rarely identified in previous reports due to lacking of clear evidences from lab-scale characterization methods. The experiments at ESRF will help us to indicate the compositional ratios of different HMS-based materials, and understand their structural evolutions with elevated temperatures and various dopants.</figDesc></figure>
