Koptyuga 3, RU -NOVOSIBIRSK Report:</p><p>While proteins can often be stabilized by maintaining them in the frozen state, waterto-ice transformation can also lead to their degradation. The primary objective of the proposed study was to investigate solute crystallization in frozen, aqueous solutions containing protein (AFP and pharmaceutical proteins), buffer, and cryoprotectants. using protocols established in the previously completed ESRF study for evaluation of solute-ice interaction, specifically AFPs and pharmaceutical proteins (LS-2228, LS-2601). The previous work was extended to investigate the effect of proteins (AFP and pharmaceutical) on ice as well as solute-ice crystallization. In the latter case, a study of the solute-ice crystallization involved the phase behavior of ionic solutes (example: buffers and salt) and non-ionic solutes (examples: sugars and sugar alcohols). The list of performed experiments is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Based on the title and previous experiments a new method to study protein/ice interaction is presented, which is based on measuring the characteristic features of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of hexagonal ice (Ih). The analysis demonstrates that two pharmaceutical proteins, recombinant human albumin (rHA) and monoclonal antibody (mAb), have a pronounced effect on the properties of ice crystals. In particular, the size of the crystalline domains is significantly smaller, and the microstrain is larger, in the solutions of the pharmaceutical proteins, when compared with a model protein (lysozyme), an antifreeze protein, and sucrose and histidine. Neither of the proteins studied exhibit preferred interaction with specific crystalline faces of Ih. The results are consistent with indirect interaction of the pharmaceutical proteins with ice, in which protein molecules are accumulated in the quasi-liquid layer next to growing ice crystallization front. Direct interaction would indicate a sorption of protein molecules on ice crystals, whereas "indirect interaction" terminology is used to describe any interference of proteins with ice crystals without sorption involved. Lysozyme molecules, on the other hand, do not exhibit any evidence of interaction (either direct or indirect) with ice crystals. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, of major difference in protein/ice interaction between different types of non-antifreeze proteins.</p><p>Selected results from the experiment were published in: <ref type="bibr">Bhatnagar, B., Zakharov, B., Fisyuk, A., Wen, X., Karim, F., Lee, K., Seryotkin, Y., Mogodi, M., Fitch, A., Boldyreva, E., Kostyuchenko, A.,</ref>  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>wilson.mogodi@uct.ac.za)</figDesc></figure>
