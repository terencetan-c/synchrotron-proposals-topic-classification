<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The main aim of the title experiment was to solve crystal structures of high-pressure polymorphs of β-alanine and to compare structures of β-alanine at high pressure depending on the way how this pressurre was reached. We have performed several measurements of different β-alanine single crystals at high hydrostatic pressures. To achieve maximum possible data completeness we have collected four datasets with different diamond anvil cell (DAC) orientations at each pressure point. This allowed us to solve crystal structure of βalanine at different pressures. In the first experiment we have solved crystal structures of βalanine at pressures till 6.2 GPa that took ~10 hours after beginning the experiment. After that we left the sample at 6.2 GPa and after next 10 hours we have visually detected a fragment of a new phase growing at the "parent" crystal. Diffraction data allowed us to confirm the fact that we have several phases in DAC, including remaining part of initial crystal and several single-crystalline blocks of a new phase. Using this data we have calculated cell parameters of new phase which were also measured during preliminary experiments at laboratory X-ray diffractometer. Intensity data were sufficient to solve crystal structure by global optimization in direct space and refine crystal structure in isotropic approximation. Crystal structure fragments of initial and high-pressure phases are shown on the figure.</p><p>Initial phase of orthorhombic β-alanine (a) crystallizes in space group Pcab while monoclinic high-pressure form (b) is monoclinic with space group P2 1 /a that was shown earlier in X-ray diffraction experiment with powder sample. Unfortunately influence of further increasing pressure on this sample was not studied due to continuous transition from initial phase to high-pressure phase at ~6 GPa. After 24 hours after beginning the experiment there were no initial phase in DAC and polycrystalline high-pressure phase was formed. In the next experiment we have increased pressure straight up to 8 GPa. In this case we did'nt see the phase transition, and only deformation of initial phase has been detected. Taking into account previous experiment we left the sample at 8 GPa for several days but no any changes could be visually detected during this time. Thus "prolonged" high-pressure phase transition was detected only for β-alanine at 6 GPa and there were no transitions at higher pressures. One can conclude that this transition is prolonged and strongly depends on the way how we reach high pressure but not only on pressure value. The effect of pressure on the γaminobutyric acid was also studied. Since the sample underwent strong fragmentation in the course of a phase transition, we had to switch to powder diffraction technique. The set of diffraction patterns was measured at pressures up to 10 GPa with a step of ~0.5 GPa. The data are being processed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,115.30,349.45,364.60,150.00" type="bitmap" /></figure>
