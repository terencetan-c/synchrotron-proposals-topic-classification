We used a membrane driven diamond pressure cell mounted in a continuous flow helium cryostat. The beam energy was about 30 keV. The used single crystals were of typically size of about 80 micron. At room temperature the nearly commensurate (NC) wavevector q NC was found to move slightly towards the incommensurate (IC) position q IC but at 18 kBar a first order like transition to an IC-Phase was observed. This high pressure IC Phase differs from the high temperature phase by a three fold splitting of the super lattice reflection, consistent with earlier observations. This successive process is illustrated by reciprocal space maps of the hk-plane in FIG. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. At 15 K the commensurate (C) Phase was found to be supercooled up to 42 kBar, where the C-to-NCtransition was observed. Similar to the room temperature measurement the NC wavevector moves to the IC position. Between 65 and 80 kBar a transition to the high pressure IC-Phase was found. On lowering thetemperature to 3.5 K to reach the potentially superconducting phase no apparent change in the diffraction pattern could be observed.</p><p>FIG. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Reproduced reciprocal space maps for different pressures at room temperature . These maps represent cuts through the reciprocal space parallel to the hk-plane, while they are integrated along the c -direction (from l = -1/3 to l = 1/3) to show all super structure * reflections .These images illustrate the effects of pressure on the NC-Phase. The green and red cross mark the first and third order NC-vector at ambient pressure, respectively.</p><p>High-Pressure IXS at ID28 and preliminary TDS at ID29: In addition we conducted high-pressure IXS at room temperature along with temperature dependent IXS at ambient pressure at ID28 and some preliminary TDS experiments at ID29. For the high-pressure experiments we used the same pressure cell as at ID09. Since these experiments took place very recently the analysis of the data is currently in process. However, the row data already clearly shows dramatic changes in the phonon dispersion as a function of external pressure, as exemplified in FIG. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. We also find a Kohn-anomaly in the high-temperature IC-phase. Our data show that this Kohn-anomaly related to the IC-phase is strongly suppressed with increasing pressure.</p><p>An equally dramatic change was observed in terms of TDS at ID29 as a function of temperature as shown in FIG. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>. Unfortunately, the temperature was more or less uncontrolled in this experiment. It is very important to perform systematic TDS studies as a function of temperature (from the low temperature C-phase at ~180K up to the high-temp IC-phase at ~400K).</p><p>FIG. <ref type="figure">2</ref>: IXS spectrum at the NC q-vector (1.689, 0.067, -1/3) for different pressures.
