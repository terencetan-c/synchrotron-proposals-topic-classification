<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Supercapacitors devices based on graphene sheets (as electrode) and ionic liquid (IL) (as electrolyte) appears as very promising for future energy storage devices. However, their properties are mainly driven by the interface between the two compounds. We use the Langmuir film procedure to elaborates and study such interface. We focus on the Graphene oxide (GO) -[C20mim] [NTf2] IL system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Our aim is to obtain first a GO / IL interface and then probe it by x-ray surface scattering (XRR, GIXD and XRF). We first studied the film formed by the pure compounds at the air-liquid interface. We have probe, according to the surface pressure, the layers thickness by XRR, the structure by surface diffraction and the amount of compounds adsorbed at the interface by fluorescence. Then, we study mixed film at the air-liquid interface for pressure after and before the plateau of the isotherm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Indeed, this plateau suggest a collapse of one (or both) specie(s). We studied the system for different concentrations. Pure Ionic liquid:</p><p>At low surface pressure (before the collapse of the monolayer) :</p><p>• XRR spectra can be adjusted by a single layer of thickness of 15 Å and a rather low density of 1.30 g.cm -3 , indicating a not very dense monolayer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pure graphene oxide:</head><p>At low surface pressure (before the collapse of the monolayer) :</p><p>• XRR spectra can be adjusted by two GO layer, the first one, in contact with water, of thickness of 10 Å and a density of 1.35 g.cm -3 , and the second one, above the first one, of thickness of 9 Å but with a density 40% lower than the one of the first layer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>   For mixed of graphene oxide and Ionic liquid film :</p><p>At low surface pressure (before the collapse) :</p><p>• XRR can be adjusted by a two layers model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> right red curve). The first layer, in contact with water, have a thickness of 12 Å and a density of 1.2 g.cm -3 indicating a pure IL composition.</p><p>The second layer, above the previous one and in contact with air, have a thickness of 8 Å and a density of 0.88 g.cm -3 indicating a GO composition.</p><p>At high surface pressure (at the end of the plateau) :</p><p>• XRR can be adjusted by a three layer model with the first one of thickness 16 Å and formed by ionic liquid molecules, the second one with a thickness of 9 Å in agreement with the thickness of GO sheets and the third one in contact with air with a thickness of 30 Å (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> right blue curve). The thickness of the first layer increases from 12 to 16 Å with a density of 1.1 g.cm -3 .</p><p>No diffraction signal is detected (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref> left curves) for both pressure. That could be due to a low signal/noise ratio n but a more detailled analysis (varying the qz integration) will be done A model of the film structure is presented on figure 5 Fluorescence spectra were simultaneously recorded for the differents surface pressure. As one can notice on the spectrum, one can detect a variation of the peaks intensities. This will allows in estimating the variation of concentration of the adsorbed species at the surface,. The sulfure intensity appears weaker after the collapse than before the collapse. This suggest that the [NTf2] do not collapse as much as the [C20mim] molecules.
