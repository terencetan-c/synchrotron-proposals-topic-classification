<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gilles RENAUD* (CEA-Grenoble)</head><p>Objective &amp; expected results :</p><p>The aim of the proposal was to provide :</p><p>1. Above all, the first in situ measurement in reciprocal space of the Si nanowire (NW) growth by UHV-CVD, from the very early stage of eutectic formation, to the end of the entire growth process.</p><p>2. We also planned to determine the NW size effect on various aspects (eutectic temperature, growth direction, etc.) with the use of E-beam patterned substrates.</p><p>3. And finally, the investigation of the influence of different growth parameters (flow rate, growth temperature, etc.)</p><p>We expected, with the combination of in situ GIXD (Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffaction) and GISAXS (Grazing Incidence X-ray Small Angle Scattering), to not only confirm what has been previously reported by TEM measurements, but also to find out what is missing, especially about what is happening in the early stage of growth, the duration of which is rather short thus making it impossible to be studied by any ex situ techniques.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusions of the study:</head><p>1. The main objective of the experiment has been achieved. As a matter of fact, not only were we able to follow the growth by applying alternatively the two techniques, we did manage to find something interesting in the early stage of growth (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>With GISAXS, we first observed a sudden change in the aspect ratio (contact angle) of the liquid catalyst as soon as the precursor gas was introduced into the growth chamber. This is probably due to the increase of Si percentage in the liquid alloy during the supersaturation process.</p><p>The supersaturation process might be partially or solely responsible for the so called incubation time which manifests itself as a characteristic delay between the beginning of the injection and the onset of the NW growth. In our case, the incubation time, which varies from tens of seconds to several minutes depending on the growth condition, was measured by conducting the same diffraction scan on a Si Bragg peak or by a time scan at the foot of a peak. Under appropriate growth condition, the size distribution of the NWs could be narrow enough to give rise to an observable NW size modulation during GIXD measurements. The result is a gradually decreasing value in direct space from 230nm to 150nm, which can be explained by the initial growth of the larger NW base and the subsequent growth of the smaller NW body. Meanwhile, GISAXS measurements reveal some strange faceting feature during the formation of the NW base, which has to our knowledge never been reported before. A detailed explanation requires further analyse of the current data and more precise measurements in the future (next proposal).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 : GIXD and GISAXS measurements of the VLS growth of Si NWs on Si(111) substrate by UHV-CVD</head><p>Once the NW growth begins, the NW length can be tracked by analysing the length modulation in GISAXS measurements. This is, however, possible only until about 200 nm as the resolution of the GISAXS is limited by divergence of the beam perpendicular to the sample. Finally, the well known sawtooth faceting was observed by both techniques, and has been reported by us in a previous experimental report already.</p><p>2. The use of E-beam patterned substates was, however, not successful as a result of various difficulties encountered during preparation of the sample (oxide free while not disturbing the pattern). We therefore switched back to the use of standard Si(111) substrate. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the result of a typical growth with different levels of magnification where we observe long straight and well faceted NWs grown on large surface area. Future improvement will focus on (i) A modified way of sample preparation to increase the yield after E-beam patterning.</p><p>(ii) Alternatively, we will try to apply the use of nano-colloidal gold as catalyst thanks to our new collaborators at the CEA laboratory (CEA/INAC/SiNaPs)</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> : SEM image of a typical Si NW growth at BM32</p><p>3. The third objective was also achieved.</p><p>Much as expected, changing the flow rate seems to affect only the growth speed while changing the growth temperature also affects the mean NW size as a result of increasing level of catalyst agglomeration at higher temperatures. One final thing worth mentioning is the use of inert gas (Ar in our case) to suppress catalyst agglomeration. While it appears that lower pressure (1e-5 mbar) has no effect at all (catalyst diameter ~ 150nm after 10min annealing at 550°C), more elevated Ar pressure (&gt;1e-4 mbar) seems to be capable of limiting the catalyst diameter to less than 50nm. The use of elevated pressure to suppress surface diffusion is already known, but the resulted GIXD measurements is rather interesting (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). We clearly distinguish two cases, the one with twin-tower shoulders and the one with just moderate modulation.</p><p>In the former case, the maxima of the interference function is situated far away from the Bragg position as a result of small inter-NW distance. The steep interference function thus dominates when calculating the structure factor. In the latter case, the distance between NW sites are relatively large, the maxima of the interference function is therefore close to the Bragg position, leaving an almost constant tail aside thus rendering the entire size modulation in the form factor to be visible.</p><p>It is worth noting that when part of the small NWs ceased to grow later during the injection (confirmed by SEM images), which explains the disappearance of the twin-tower shoulders in the later stage of growth (black curve, case #1).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> : GIXD measurements on samples with and without the presense of Ar (&gt;1e-4 mbar)</p><p>Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.):</p><p>IF-INS (BM32 ESRF) possesses, to our knowledge, the only system worldwide capable of delivering both CVD (group IV precursors) and MBE growth under UHV condition while performing in situ GIXD and GISAXS measurement at the same time.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,34.06,36.96,526.35,352.80" type="bitmap" /></figure>
