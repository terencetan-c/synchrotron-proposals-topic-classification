<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was to look at powder diffraction of a variety of plastic crystal mateiralsionic supramolecular materialsin situ with both variable temperature and variable pressure.</p><p>The experimental equipment enabled both isothermal-variable pressure and isobaric variable temperature measurements.</p><p>The variable temperature utilized the cryostream to control temperautre between 200K and 500Kthis set up had been proven to work exceptionally well for these mateirals in the past and was a continuing success.</p><p>The variable pressure was applied utilizing two difference pressure cells. First a gas based pressure cell, which was very effective but had manual control of gas inside the hutch so the experiemnt was labour intensive.</p><p>The second pressure cell was a custom built sellmade by Charles Mcmonaglewhich utilized hydralic fluid to apply the pressure to a quartz capillary. This was also highly successful, however, there were a few key challenges. 1. the gratest challenge encountered was that the sample would gradually move along the capillary and out of the beam during sweeps of increasing and decreasing pressure. This meant that several sampels had to be prepared. 2. The preparation time for getting the materials in and out of the specialized quartz capillary was relatively long -1 hour. 3. The temperature sweeps were limited due to the thermal mass of the capillary holder and high thermal conductivity of the capillary, which also meant that significant time was needed to stabilize the temperature between each thermal step. In all this experiemtn was highly successful and the new presure cell enabled us to map out the pressure and temperature phase diagrams fro a number of new promising barocaloric plastic crystal materials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Julian Walker -Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway Mari-Ann Einarsrud -Norwegian University of Science and Technology Charles Mcmonagle -ESRF Jorge Salgado Beceiro -University a Coruna, Spain Manuel Sanchez -University a Coruna, Spain</figDesc></figure>
