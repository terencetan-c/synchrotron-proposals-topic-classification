<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Perovskite oxide systems (ABO 3 , with B=metal) are attracting considerable interest due to their activity in the catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons (A-site substitution controls the mobility of lattice oxygen atoms, while B-site substitution seeks to enhance the catalytic properties). They offer the structural flexibility that these catalysts require for H 2 generation. In teh case of powder cobalt catalysts, the metallic elements aggregate forming particles as in the case of cobaltites. However, linking the evolution of the structure at atomic level with the variations in its catalytic activity by monitoring the production of the resulting gases at high temperatures and pressure is a difficult task due to the intrinsic polycrystalline nature of the sample that difficult the identification of the basic surface mechanisms responsible of its catalytic activity. For this reason, it is necessary to follow the catalytic activity on close model systems to the real one to understand the surface mechanisms that govern these processes. For this reason we selected to study the methane oxidation process on single Co(0001) crystals at low and high temperatures.</p><p>During the experiment we first used this cobalt catalyst to study the CO-oxidation reaction process at temperatures below the hcp to fcc phase transition that takes place around 500º C. In a second part of the experiment we followed the methane oxidation reaction process between 550º C and 850ºC using in all cases 5% diluted reagent gases in Ar, i.e. CO, CH4 and O2.</p><p>Previous to the methane oxidation experiment, the cobalt crystal was pre-treated in the reaction chamber by oxidation (0.2 mbar O2 at 520 K) and annealing at 575 K cycles until removing the residual carbon and oxygen from the surface. The same cleaning procedure was already applied in a previous LEED and STM experiment in our home UHV lab. The methane oxidation reaction experiment was divided in three parts: i) A series of ramp temperatures were measured at different constant CH4:O2 partial pressure ratios to determine the lower activation temperature of the reaction as shown in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, where the CH4:O2 ratio was of two.</p><p>ii)</p><p>Measurements performed at constant temperature (600 to 850ºC) and CH4 partial pressure while increasing/decreasing O2 partial pressure in constant steps and vice versa. iii)</p><p>Measurements performed at constant temperature (600 to 850ºC) while increasing/decreasing the CH4 and O2 partial pressures at constant CH4:O2 ratio. These measurements were performed to get the activation energy of the partial oxidation reaction of methane and to explore the selectivity of the methane oxidation since it depends on different parameters as temperature, partial pressures of reactive gases and total flux rate of the gas mixture. The ratios between the gas partial pressures from the reaction, H2:CO2 or H2:CO, will help to discriminate the type of reaction process takes place. Moreover, it could also happen than the oxygen concentration in the cobalt sample (surface oxide and bulk oxide formation) could modify the selectivity of the methane oxidation.</p><p>For this reason, apart to follow the evolution of the surface oxide and bulk oxide single crystal peaks, we also followed the evolution of identical phases but in polycrystalline form that were formed on the crystal. For this reason a series of two-theta scans at fixed grazing incidence angle were also measured. From the partial analysis of these scans three different phases were identified from the diffraction pattern (cobalt fcc, cobalt oxide: CoO and bulk oxide: Co3O4). These patterns show an evolution that depends on both the temperature and partial pressure of the reagent gases and the history of the applied condition measurement. The analysis of the data still is not completely finished due to the extra measurements we are doing in our lab on polycrystalline cobalt samples to reproduce the same behavior than that observed in the present experiment. However, this procedure we are doing in our lab is not completely identical to that followed in ID03 since our reacting chamber is not coupled to any diffractometer, so, the diffraction measurements can only be done exsitu.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Evolution of the partial pressures of the reagent CH4 and O2 gases and products of the reaction. The peaks are due to the fact that measurements were done in batch mode (gas flow interrupted). Intensity measuremets were done in flow mode measuring some directional scans to follow the evolution of metallic cobalt, surface oxide (CoO) and bulk oxide (Co3O4) with temperature. It is clearly observed that methane oxidation increases with temperature being even observable in flow mode as a modulation of the background curve. At this particular (CH4:O2) partial pressure ratio, the CO as well as the H2O formation is still small.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="3,33.96,348.36,420.60,324.96" type="bitmap" /></figure>
