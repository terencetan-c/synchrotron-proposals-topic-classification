<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the framework of experiment MA-4527 granted by ESRF for 3 shifts on beam line ID22 (started on 21 September 2020 at 08:00 and ended on 22 September at 08:00) twenty high-resolution powder patterns of 18 compounds were measured. The X-ray wavelengths used were 0. <ref type="table">354345(3)</ref> and <ref type="table">0.354317(3)</ref> Å. The patterns were measured in the 2 ranges 0.5 -38 o . The Figures of all 20 patterns are shown below. Samples MOF46, MOF39a &amp; b, MOF57 and MOF137 are representatives of MOFs based on porphyrinylphosphonates. Sample MOF46 has been measured at T = 25, 75 &amp; 150 o C, three patterns are successfully indexed. Pattern for MOF137 is also indexed. The rest patterns are under consideration. Samples KEP35 &amp; KEP290 are MOFs based on tetrakis(imidazolyl)borate and tetrakis(2methylimidazolyl)borate with Co. The crystal structure of KEP35 is already solved. Pattern for KEP290 is indexed.. Samples HZSM5, AHZSM1 &amp; 2, TS1P and TS1P75 are Zeolites (structure type MFI) containing (Al, Ti) and activated with anatase. The Rietveld refinements are in progress to establish the sites of (Si, Al) and (Si, Ti) replacements and content of the pores. Samples CNA1 &amp; 2, CCA432 and LCA342 are ternary intermetallics with rare earth elements, La and Ce. Each sample contains several phases, including the new one, which has to be established. Samples GAVR48 &amp; GAVR49 are chiral organic diamidophosphites. Both patterns are indexed, the structure determination is in progress.</p><p>Finally, we estimate the obtained synchrotron patterns as very informative and thank the ID22 staff for their high-quality work in this remote mail-in experiment.</p></div>
