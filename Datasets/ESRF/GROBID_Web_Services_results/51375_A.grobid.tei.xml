<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>3 Risks associated with the use of chemicals and gases  For each phase you must specify:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Risks and associated preventive measures</head><p>-which of the above-mentioned equipment will be used, -the conditions in which the equipment, products will be used, -the particular risks of the stage, -feedback on previous use (incidents which already occurred involving this type of equipment or installation), The associated preventive measures will appear in the table below (sections 2 and 3.2).</p><p>The oven will be mounted and a leaking test (using helium) for the gases will be done. We will keep the sample in the cell and another leaking test will be done (every time that we need to change the sample a leaking test will be done). The sample will be reduced in 5%H2/He (maximum flux of 100mL/min), 5 0C/min until 500 0C. The sample will be kept in this temperature per 1 hour. Then, the temperature will be decreased and a misture of 5%CO/He with H2O (carried by He) will be used as the reactantes for the reaction. The highest temperature that will be used for the reaction will be 400 0C. Experiments using just one of the reactants per time will also be done. In case of gas leaking the cylinder should be closed until the problem be solved. In case of problems with the oven the power should be turn off.</p></div>
