<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>oscillation experiment under 1OOK and 0.996 A wavelength . These data sets were :</p><p>No. 1. Total of 90 oscillation shots were obtained . The camera length was 450 mm , the exposure time was 30 sec , the oscillation angle was 1.0 degree and the number of oscillations was 1 way . We tried to process these data by program DENZO in our laboratory , but the resolution was lower than 6 A and these spots are so poor that we can't index .</p><p>No.2 . Ninety-two frames were taken . The camera length was 400 mm , the exposure time was 30 sec exposure , the oscillation angle was 0.5 degree at first , and from 46th frame , we changed the exposure time to 60 sec and both of these data were collected by 1 way oscillation . The crystal was small and quickly deteriorated by X-ray . However first 20 frames (10 degree) contains reflections up to 2.5A resolution . We processed was 49 frames . After scaling data , we got 3.5 A resolution data at 44.8%A completeness . However , it is far from our goal.</p><p>No.3 . We took approximately 60 oscillation shots The camera length was 450 mm , the exposure time was 20 sec , oscillation angle was 0.75 degree and the number of oscillations was 1 way . 38 frames were useful as data due to noise because of detector trouble. The resolution of the initial frames in this data set was to about 2.7 A . And then the resolution was getting worse . However the crystal was better than that of No. Although our crystals are quickly deteriorated by X-ray , the crystals diffract Xray up to 2.5 A resolution at initial 20 shots of 0.5 degree oscillation photograph . Thus nine crystals are needed to collect full data set at high resolution . we would like to use the beam line again to obtain complete data set at 2.5 A resolution .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>2 in respect of X-ray damage . The No.2 and No.3 data sets were processed by program DENZO and were merged by SCALEPACK. In the No.2 data set , total of 43,022 independent reflections with 44.8% completeness and 9.4% Rmerge at 3.5 A resolution were obtained from 309,861 observed reflections . No.3 data set produced 32,976 independent reflections with 34.4% completeness and 8.0% Rmerge at 3.5 A resolution . Total 550,055 of observed reflections of No.2 and No.3 data sets were merged together into 58,488 independent reflections with 61.0 % completeness and 10.1 % Rmerge .</figDesc></figure>
