<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The following measurements have been performed during the beamtime: Dependence of diffraction/diffuse scattering from current and temperature was recorded for GdTe 3 as for having transition temperature well above room temperature T C1 ~ 377 K. The principal problem is current heating, potentially masking the effects of CDW sliding. In order to discriminate the effects, following datasets were collected: A) Ambient temperature, zero current B) No external heating, 250 mA C) External heating to 328 K, low current D) External heating to 338 K, low current Temperature of heat blower gas in case (C) was adjusted to fit the resistance of case (B). The effect on Bragg intensities is more robust than for the diffuse scattering. Effect on second-order satellites is illustrated by Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The intensity drop in the sliding mode is superiour to the case C, supposed to be measured for the same temperature as B. It is also superiour to the case D, where measurement was performed at still higher temperature. It can be proposed thus that the effect of CDW sliding manifests in diffraction/diffuse scattering in the same way as sample heating. In the particular case of GdTe 3 above the sliding threshold its effect is seen as virtual heating by at least 10-15 K Figs. 3 illustrate IXS data taken in this experiment on TbTe 3 as a function of the applied current and at room temperature. The spectra taken at Q=(3 -6 0.3) shows an effect that very likely due to sample moving (or heating) than related to an intrinsic effect. Spectra at 0 and 50 mA are basically the same, that at -50 mA is slightly more intense. The spectra at Q=(3 -5 0.3), close to the CDW modulation peak, remains unchanged.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">•</formula><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>.
