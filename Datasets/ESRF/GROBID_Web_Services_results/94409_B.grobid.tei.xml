<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Summarize of the exp:</p><p>Is described here the essential information needed to use the data. You may find the complete experimental report below which is a little messy since we met several pbm during our work.</p><p>We performed simultaneous SAXS-WAXS measurements for every sample from Group1, 2, 3 and 4.The temperature range asked has been done for all of them except the Group1 for which the maximum reachable temperature was around 147°C due to the broken resistor on one side of the sample holder. Our problem of heating had two consequences : firstly to not be able to reach 160°C and secondly that the temperature values are not exactly the ones asked and mentioned in the header of the files and summarized in the file Temperature_Lyu (measured temperature). In order to estimate the real temperatures (Treal), we have measured temperature in the first sample position S1 and last one S11 and compare them with set temperature. Temperature of the samples starting from 6th position up to 11th need to be corrected. The table below contains real temperature of the sample at the position 11 at the known set temperature. All others positions can be interpolated between set temperature and the T11.</p><p>Measured temp. Real Temp. 30.0 28.5 40.0 38.5 50.0 47.6 60.0 56.4 70.0 66.2 80.0 75.6 90.0 84.5 100.0 93.4 110.0 102.9 120.0 112.3 130.0 122.3</p><p>Data reduction has been done right now without subtraction of the empty cell. The names of the files are like for the first part of the experiment, for example : Group1/21Feb25D5_3500_S1.dat. D5 corresponds to SAXS and WOS corresponds to WAXS. Files are classified in several folders named Group1, 2 and 3. For this example, 3500 corresponds to the run number. S1 corresponds to the first sample of your priority list being in the group 1. I wrote in red in the exp. report (below), the names of the samples, the associated names (S1, S2…) and the position in the sample holder for each group.</p><p>We also had some transmission measurement problems. You will see some curves, the first temperatures of the group 1 are shifted compared to the others. It is possible to correct that by applying a multiplicative factor. I could do that if you can not but in a first attempt, I prefer to deliver the data like this in order for you to know. This transmission pbm also creates difficulties to substrat the empty cell. the empty cell having a large pick around 0.19ang-1, it is possible to estimate the multiplicative factor to apply to the empty cell intensity to eliminate this peak. One more time, I prefer to not do it in a first attempt. The empty cell run numbers are written in green in the exp. report.</p></div>

It was missing in the program. I stopped the macro around 8am since it could not reach the last temperature 25C. it had started around 10pm last on thursday. it has been too quick.</p><p>Temperature ramping rate was 50K/min which far to fast and could cause the problem with regulation.</p><p>Moreover, positions of the sampleholder were not correct and not all samples has been measured. SrCl2 2M 90s just to see for a flat but bump of water on the wosna one of the resistance of nanodac has been broken which did not let us go to the 160C. The thermocouple was between positions 5 and 6. So, positions 7-11 might not have the right temperature. probably there is a gradient of temperatures.</p></div>
