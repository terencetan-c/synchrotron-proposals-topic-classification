<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Polymer surfaces and interfaces play a vital role in applications such as adhesion, barrier coatings, polymer electronic devices and yet there is a severe shortage of experimental information and techniques on chain structure at interfaces. Grazing incidence x -ray diffraction (GIXRD) studies is one of the few suitable techniques: we have developed GIXRD studies of the polymer surface which we can now perform during insitu processing. To date, we have focussed on the important commodity polymer poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), in which we have demonstrated that the surface crystallises at a lower temperature than the bulk of the film <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In this experiment, we extended these measurements to isotactic-polystyrene, i-PS, in order to investigate whether some or all of the effects observed in PET occur at other semi-crystalline polymer surfaces. This is the first experiment on ID1 studying polymer surfaces with GIXRD, in which we explored the use of a linear detector for rapid data acquisition to enable good time -resolution during in-situ annealing.</p><p>i-PS films of thickness about 1000 Å were deposited by spin-coating onto Si(001) substrates. Angles of incidence α of 0.18° and 0.60° were used to probe the surface and the bulk of the film respectively, the critical angle being 0.22°. Scans were performed in two geometries with photons of energy 8.0 keV in order to probe correlations in the plane of the surface and normal to the surface (fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). It was found that the surface scattering was swamped by the background scattering from the beryllium dome when using a 120° linear detector. It is clear that polymer surface scattering with an area detector will require an evacuated beam path with no windows visible to the detector -a mode which will be useable in future on ID1 by virtue of the evacuated diffractometer chamber. In this experiment, due to time pressures, we needed to resort to the Braun short linear detector oriented normal to the surface with collimation slits scanned mechanically using the diffractometer.</p><p>A i-PS film pre-annealed at 150°C, prior to the experiment, was investigated in both the GISPS and GIABS geometries for surface and bulk-sensitive scans. The scans show a pronounced anisotropy (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>): the scattering in the plane of the surface (fig <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) is very different from that normal to the surface (fig <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</p><p>The in-plane scattering is dominated by three sharp peaks, which can be indexed according to the hexagonal unit cell, which is conventionally used to describe the rhombohedral primitive unit cell, as the (1,1,0), (3,0,0) and (2,2,0) Bragg peaks. These are the l=0 Bragg peaks in this Q-range and hence it establishes that there is a dominant ordering in which the α-helices of the i-PS crystalline structure, lying parallel to the c-axis, are oriented normal to the surface (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The narrow peak widths correspond to a domain size of 180 Å. These crystalline peaks appear similarly in both the surface scattering and the bulk scattering, possibly indicating that the orientation of the α-helices is primarily caused by the buried interface with the Si substrate. However, the more diffuse scattering displays significant structural differences between the surface and bulk: 1. the peak in the amorphous scattering at the surface occurs at about 0.8 Å in the GISPS geometry whereas the corresponding peak for the bulk of the film lies around 1.3 Å (fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). 2. the peak positions in the GIABS geometry differ significantly between bulk and surface scattering (fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). The cause of these two differences between the surface and bulk structure is currently unclear and under investigation. A series of in-situ GIXRD scans during annealing at 85°C showed little difference between the kinetics of surface and bulk ordering in stark contrast to PET. It appears that the ordering in i-PS is dominated by the buried interface whereas the ordering in PET is driven from the surface. However, in i-PS, the amorphous structure at the surface is significantly different from the bulk of the film, requiring further investigation. 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 1E-3 0.01 0.1 1 10 (2,2,0) (3,0,0) (1,1,0) Intensity (normalised) Q / Å -1 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 1E-3 0.01 0.1 1 10 Intensity (normalised) Q / Å -1 Fig. 2 GIXRD scans from i-PS film in the (a) GISPS (b) GIABS geometry, sensitive to in-plane and out-of plane correlations respectively. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): P Jukes, R A L Jones, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sheffield A Das, D Trolley, J E Macdonald Department of Physics and Astronomy, Cardiff University</figDesc></figure>
