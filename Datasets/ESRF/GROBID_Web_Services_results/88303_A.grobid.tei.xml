<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Colloids and nanoparticles are important nutrient-bearing materials known to facilitate eutrophication of natural waters through phosphorus (P) leaching. However, the chemical nature of colloidal and nanoparticulate P in leachates that drains through agricultural soils is not fully understood. Such knowledge is crucial to the mitigation of nutrient loss and prevention of groundwater contamination. We were awarded 9 shifts on ID21 -X-ray microscopy beamline to reveal the chemical nature of colloids and nanoparticles in leachates that drain through Swedish agricultural soils situated in the drainage basins of the North and Baltic Seas. Our experiment led to the successful acquisition of multi-elemental XRF images and micro-focused sulphur (S) &amp; P K-edge XANES spectroscopic data in colloids and nanoparticles collected from four agricultural sites.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental and Results</head><p>Leachates from experimental fields were collected from drain pipes and fractionated into two different size ranges using membrane filtration and ultrafiltration with nominal cut-offs of 0.45 µm and 10 kDa, respectively. The fractions are henceforth referred to as 'colloids' (~2,000-450 nm) and 'nanoparticles' (450-1 nm). The fractions were deposited on Ultralene® thin film allowed to dry at 25  C and subjected to high-resolution XRF mapping from 1 to 8 keV in vacuum. The result (example from the Krusenberg site, 'KRUS') shows that both fractions contained multiple elements, including macronutrients such as P and S and potential metal contaminants such as chromium (Cr) (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). However, the intensity of aluminium (Al) &amp; silicon (Si) appeared to be higher in the colloidal fraction. The latter is expected for a fraction likely to be dominated by aluminosilicate clay minerals. The intensity of P appeared to be similar regardless of particle size. The co-localisation of P with other elements, especially Al, S, calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe), which are known to influence P speciation, was investigated by principal component analysis (PCA). The result suggests co-localisation of P with S in both size fractions (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>The XRF map of the P and S distribution confirms almost identical features in their spatial distribution (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). This significant colocalisation of S with P made further examination of the chemical speciation of S necessary in order to establish the extent to which the S co-localized with P was inorganic.</p><p>We therefore acquired S K-edge XANES data from up to six S hot spots in our samples.</p><p>The result shows distinctive peaks at 2473.8 eV in all size fractions showing the presence of reduced organic S (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, P K-edge XANES spectra were acquired from up to 10 spots in our samples in order to establish the spatial variability of chemical P in the samples. P speciation in KRUS showed only little spatial variation. The XANES data were treated in Athena, in which the 8-10 P-XANES scans collected from each spot were merged into a single spectrum and compared to selected reference compounds using linear combination fitting.</p><p>The results show that P existed predominantly (70 (±7) %) as organic P regardless of the particle size (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The only difference in P speciation with regard to particle sizes was in the 30(±7) % inorganic P fraction, which appeared to be dominated by Al-bound P in the colloids and by Ca-bound P in the nanoparticles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The results of elemental co-localisation and S &amp; P K-edge XANES spectroscopy revealed organic P as the dominant leached particulate P phase in our experimental sites. This calls for further research into the mechanism of the translocation of organic particles through the soil profile. Unlike the high-level uncertainties associated with P speciation studies using bulk P-XANES, our results in which the spatial co-localisation of elements was revealed by XRF mapping in combination with size-specific molecular speciation analysis of P-XANES is to our knowledge the most accurate characterisation of particulate P in natural leachates to this date.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="2,20.50,594.44,556.00,180.65" type="bitmap" /></figure>
