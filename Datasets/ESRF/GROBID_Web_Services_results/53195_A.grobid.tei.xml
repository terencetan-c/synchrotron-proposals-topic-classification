<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The main aim of this proposal was the structural characterization of SRP-signal sequence complexes. The Signal Recognition Particle (SRP) is a universally conserved protein-RNA complex which enables the cotranslational membrane targeting of proteins. We have collected over ten data sets of an SRP-signal sequence complex which diffracted to 3.0 Ä (space group <ref type="bibr">P21212, cell: 112, 122, 91, 90, 90, 90)</ref>. We have now solved this structure using molecular replacement (current R-factor is 24 %, and R-free 27 %). Our aim is now to improve these crystals to diffract to higher resolution. We are doing this, using post-crystallization methods.</p><p>A better resolution in this case is important to place crucial amino acid sequences undoubtedly in the electron density.</p><p>Other aims of this proposal were the structural characterization of: Transthyretin (TTR)-drug complexes. Mutations in the TTR gene cause transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), which is caused by the misfolding of protein monomers derived from the tetrameric protein. We have collected more than five data sets of TTR bound to different drugs. All of these drugs show high antitoxic activity in cell toxicity assays. These TTRdrug co-crystals diffracted to 1.5 Ä with one TTR-drug co-crystal even better than 1.1 Ä. All TTR-drug structures have now been solved and a manuscript is currently in preparation.</p><p>Two datasets were collected from the signalling domain of the transcriptional regulatory protein CpxR from E.coli. CpxR is a member of the two-component regulatory system CpxA/CpxR. This system combats a variety of extracytoplasmic protein-mediated toxicities. These crystals diffracted to 3,2 -3,5 Ä resolution. We are currently trying to improve these crystals by modifying crystallization conditions.</p><p>Small crystals of the promoter region for the RNA dependent RNA polymerase in the Dengue RNA genome diffracted poorly and no data sets were collected. Dengue virus is a leading cause of serious illness and death among children in Asian and Latin American countries. The Dengue virus belongs to the (+) RNA Flavivirus family which includes other viruses causing life threatening diseases such as West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus and yellow fever virus. We are currently trying to improve these crystals by modifying crystallization conditions and modifying the RNA constructs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Studies of Signal Sequence Binding to SRP</figDesc></figure>
