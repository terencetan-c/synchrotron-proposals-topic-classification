<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Lead white, a mixture of hydrocerussite <ref type="bibr">[2 PbCO3</ref> . Pb(OH)2] and cerussite (PbCO3) is a pigment that has been observed to blacken over time in mural paintings. This blackening can often be attributed to the formation of plattnerite (β-PbO2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> This phenomenon has been observed in a series of Cimabue's 13 th century mural paintings of San Francesco Basilica in Assisi, Italy. After an earthquake in 1997 fragments of these mural paintings were collected which show that originally white brushstrokes have blackened (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> The aim of this research is to better understand the mechanism behind the oxidation of lead white and which factors influence it. For this part of the experiment a series of model samples have been analyzed which were made by exposing lead white to different conditions such as pH and oxidizing agents. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPERIMENTAL</head><p>Submicroscopic SR-based XRPD measurements were performed at beamline ID16b of the European Synchrotron Radiation facility, which uses a hard Xray beamline intended for 2D or 3D analysis of micro-and nano-scaled materials. Measurements were performed on mock-up paint samples, prepared as 20 and 50 µm thick cross sections. The clearest diffraction patterns were obtained from the thicker mock-up samples (50 µm). These were acquired in transmission geometry by means of an X-ray beam with a spot size of 60 × 85 nm 2 , at the energy of 29.6 keV. Oil-based paint was prepared from two different kinds of lead white by mixing them with boiled linseed oil and for the pigment A (rich in hydrocerussite) also the fresco technique was used (with slaked lime as binding medium, in a 2:1 lime/lead white ratio). The resulting paints were applied on polycarbonate slides before the start of the oxidation treatment. The reaction between the sodium hypochlorite solution (~13% free chlorine, i.e., all chlorine present in the water as Cl2(g), HOCl(aq) and OCl -(aq), pH ~13) and the powdered mixtures A and B (i.e. without the presence of any binding medium) was studied first. The treatment was performed by submerging the powdered pigments into NaOCl solution in a dark and sealed environment for one week. After drying, the model paint samples (mock-ups) were exposed to the same sodium hypochlorite solution as mentioned above by dipping them into the solution. The mock-ups were dipped in the solution for one, three and six days. In some cases, treated samples were given a post-treatment by exposing them to a solution of diluted hydrochloric acid (~3%) to facilitate the XRPD analysis. After the exposure, the mock-ups were prepared for the analysis: some mock-ups were embedded in acrylic resin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">RESULTS</head><p>In general, the presence of PbO2 could not always be detected after one day NaOCl exposure. NaOCl-induced degradation of pigment B (rich in cerussite) never gave rise to any positive identification of plattnerite. This is likely caused by the overlap between the diffraction lines of cerussite and plattnerite. However, scrutinyte was detected to be abundantly present. This is highly suggestive of a secondary maturation reaction in which α-PbO2 is gradually converted to β-PbO2. To better understand the formation process of plattnerite and scrutinyte, different parameters such as the composition of the starting material or the pH and dissolved inorganic carbon in the exposition solution should be considered and carefully monitored during the reaction process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 (a) Assisi Cathedral (b, c) details of mural paintings damaged during the earthquake (d) fragment showing a strong amount of blackening (e) fragment showing a slight amount of blackening.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,33.96,604.68,533.04,91.92" type="bitmap" /></figure>
