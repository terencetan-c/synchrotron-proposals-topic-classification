<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>The photon source is the APPLE-II type helical undulator HU-38 at the fundamental harmonic of its emission. The annealed samples were measured in the 2 nd experimental hutch (EH3) under vacuum and at T = 298K in a top-up 7/8+1 multibunch filling mode for better beam stability and nearly constant beam current of 130 mA. The intensity detector used was a silicon photodiode and the total fluorescence yield (TFY) was collected in backscattered geometry (detector plane at 90° respect the beam vector). Particularly, the Ni K-edge and Ti Kedge were measured in grazing incidence configuration.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The operando measurements were performed in the 3 rd experimental hutch (EH4) (with the chopper stopped) at atmospheric pressure in open air and at T = 298K. Two silicon drift detectors<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> (SDD) were used to collect the partial fluorescence yield (PFY) in backscattering configuration. A 20 μm thick Co foil was inserted in front of the SDD to reduce elastic scattering for Ni K-edge. Beam spot size of ~5 um was achieved using 2 Be parabolic lenses with a radius of curvature of 50 μm (focal image distance ~1.6 m) and it was used for precise XANES mapping. Spot size of 200 μm was set with the secondary slits and it was used for low-photon density XANES over large areas. Polyscans were done in the 6521.9 -6622.9 eV energy range. In order to improve sensitivity and for time-resolved operando measurements (scale of seconds), spectra were also acquired at fixed energy close to the Ni K-edge and Ti K-edge inflection points. A Keithley 2410 sourcemeter was used to apply bias to the device (voltage applied on Pt contact and TiN contact grounded).</p></div>

It is worth noting that the black XANES spectrum was measured prior to any applied DC sweeps in operando measurements. In the inset, it is clearly seen that the shift of the Ni-K edge towards lower energy, suggesting Ni is spontaneously reduced when putting contact L2NO4 with TiN. Thus, a TiNOx interlayer might be formed spontaneously after evaporating TiN on top of L2NO4. This could be due to the uptake of oxygen from L2NO4 layer into TiN. </p></div>

XANES measurements of L2NO4 films with different oxygen stoichiometry were carried out. L2NO4 thin films were annealed ex ante in different oxygen partial pressure conditions, corresponding to different charging levels and the shift of the Ni-K edge was measured, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4a</ref>. The inflection point, obtained via the first/second derivative method, shifts by about 0.7eV (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4b</ref>) continuously from the hydrogen to the oxygen annealed sample. This correlates to a change in the oxygen off-stoichiometry of about 0.15, which makes this material an interesting candidate for the use in oxygen ion batteries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Ti/L2NO4/Pt devices with different thermal annealings</head><p>Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) is an additional process to further oxidize TiOx interlayer at the Ti/L2NO4 interface. RTA step is required to trigger the RS in Ti/L2NO4/Pt devices. Three Ti/L2NO4/Pt samples were submitted to three RTAs with different durations. The XANES measurements focused at Ni-K edge and Ti-K edge were performed on these three samples, as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>, respectively. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>, the first/second derivative of full XANES spectra was added at the bottom to determine the Ni-K edge energy for each sample. The Ni-K edge of the sample annealed for 3 minutes is shifted towards lower energy, suggesting Ni is more reduced. The sample annealed for 10 minutes of RTA shows the lowest Ni-K edge energy, suggesting the most reduced Ni in L2NO4 film. This observation can be attributed to the loss of oxygen, which was diffused to Ti electrode and further oxidized TiOx interlayer can be formed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref> is XANES measurements at Ti-K edge of those three samples with TiO2 power (Ti 4+ ) and Ti foil (Ti 0+ ) added for comparison. The first/second derivative was also used to determine the Ti-K edge (not shown, similar to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>).

The pristine sample and 3-minute sample show the intermediate valence of Ti 3+ , while the 10-minute sample shows the valence of Ti 4+ (edge position is close to TiO2 powder (Ti 4+ )). This observation is consistent with the Ni-K edge XANES in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>, suggesting that 3 minutes are not long enough to further oxidize TiOx interlayer, while 10 minutes lead to too much oxidized TiOx (mostly TiO2). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The XANES experiments carried out in beamline ID12 have allowed for observing the variation of the Ni-K edge position (valence state change) in operando mode and mapping mode. These results suggest that oxygen movement could play a key role in RS behaviour. First, oxygen could be spontaneously uptaken when TiN is evaporated on top of L2NO4. Next, the reversible change of Ni oxidation states (due to the oxygen ion drift) during the RS process could be related to the switching mechanism. However, this observation was not able to obtain for Ti-K edge position where the individual cycles did not close.</p><p>For ex situ XANES measurements of L2NO4 films with different oxygen stoichiometry, thanks to the large shift and the absence of major diffraction peaks, the device architecture and materials choice can be used for further XANES measurements. Additionally, the obtained large shift is promising for planned in situ measurements under different temperatures, atmospheres and polarization in the upcoming beamtime to be able to investigate the cation valence state with spatial resolution.</p><p>Ex situ XANES measurements of Ti/L2NO4/Pt devices with different RTA duration confirm the role of the RTA process in the formation of TiOx interlayer. The displacements of Ni-K edge and Ti-K edge were observed between different RTA samples, suggesting Ni decreased towards lower valence state and Ti increased towards higher valence after being exposed to RTA, being in agreement with the further oxidation of TiOx (oxygen migrated from L2NO4).</p><p>4960 4970 4980 4990 5000 5010 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 Norm Energy (eV) Pristine 10-min annealing 03-min annealing TiO2 powder Ti foil Ti(0) 4977.7 4979.3 4978.6 4979.7 -0.10 -0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 1st Deriv 8340 8360 -0.15 -0.10 -0.05 0.00 0.05 0.10 2nd Deriv Ene 8 3 4 8 . 0 2 3 8 3 4 8 . 1 9 7 8 3 4 8 . 3 3 1 8300 8320 8340 8360 8380 8400 8420 8440 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 Norm Energy (eV) 10' anneal 3' anneal Pristine (a) (b)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (Left) XANES spectra of L2NO4 film with electrode (red line) and without electrode (black line).
