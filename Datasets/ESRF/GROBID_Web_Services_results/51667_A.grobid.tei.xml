<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of project ES45 was to identify the mineral phases responsible for burial of phosphorus (P) in lowoxygen marine sediments, using a combination of micro XRF mapping, P K-edge micro XANES. In particular, we are interested to determine the presence of Fe (II) and Mn (II) phosphates in these sediments. Sediment samples from three low-oxygen systems (the Baltic Sea, the Bothnian Sea and the saline Grevelingen Lake, Netherlands) were prepared by anoxic epoxy-resin embedding. In order to quickly navigate at ID21 to P-rich zones on the samples, pre-mapping at 30 µm resolution was performed on a desktop Orbis micro XRF at Utrecht. One sample from each of the three locations was analysed in turn at ID21. From each sample, a small number of pre-identified P-rich zones was targeted. Initially, micro XRF maps were made of the regions of interest using a focused beam (0.35 x 0.7 µm) at 2.4 keV. XANES spectra across the P K-edge (2.13-2.22 keV) were then collected in fluorescence mode from regions of high P counts in the micro XRF maps. A series of phosphate mineral standards, included freshly synthesized vivianite (stored permanently in an argon-filled jar), were prepared in pellets. XANES spectra were collected in fluorescence mode using an unfocused beam.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Regions of high P concentrations were easily located in the epoxy-embedded sediment samples. In the sample from the central Baltic Sea, P was enriched in biogenic structures of 100-200 µm diameter, and in smaller globular structures elsewhere in the sediment matrix (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The XANES grabs from these samples varied regarding the white line intensity but were similar in view of the lack of pre-and post-edge features. This indicates that P is likely bound in Fe (II) and/or Mn (II) phases in these sediments. Similar XANES spectra were observed in P enrichments in the sample from the Bothnian Sea.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In contrast, all the prominent P enrichments in the sample from the Grevelingen Lake showed XANES spectra indicative of Ca-phosphates. These spectra are characterized by a P K-edge white line shifted slightly to lower energies with respect to the variscite standard, and by a pronounced post-edge shoulder as observed in the Ca-phosphate standards. The larger P enrichments in this sample also appear to be associated with biogenic structures.</p><p>In order to deconvolve potential Fe (II) and Mn (II) phosphate enrichments in the samples from the Baltic and Bothnian Seas, we extracted the distributions of multiple elements from the high resolution XRF maps. In the case of the sample from the Baltic Sea, these results show that the mineral phase present at Point 1 is likely a Mn (II) phosphate in the rim of the biogenic particle, where both P and Mn are enriched while Fe is depleted (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This level of spatial detail is unprecedented in these studies and will greatly assist our efforts to understand the processes by which P is sequestered in low-oxygen sediments. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
