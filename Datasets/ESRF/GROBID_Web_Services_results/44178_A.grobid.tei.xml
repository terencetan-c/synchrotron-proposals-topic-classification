<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ID16, ESRF</head><p>Report:</p><p>The aim of the experiment was to study the crystal field excitation spectra of NiO using high-resolution RIXS at the Ni K edge, as a function of transferred crystal momentum. The idea was to confirm k-dependence of the RIXS cross section and its use as a novel tool as a unoccupied-band mapping.</p><p>The experiment was done at the beamline ID16. The incident beam from three consecutive undulators was monochromatised by a combination of a cryogenically cooled double-crystal Si(111) premonochromator and a Si(444) channel-cut postmonochromator; the resulting incident bandwidth was 80 meV. The beam was focused into a spot size of 35×100 µm (V×H) on the sample, which was a cuboid-shaped single crystal of NiO. The spectrometer was based on a vertical Rowland circle with a spherically shaped but diced Si(551), curvature radius R = 1 m. The photon energy was 8.3 keV, corresponding to the Ni K edge.</p><p>The experimental technique was resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS), in which the energy-loss (energy transfer value denoted as E) spectra of valence-electron excitations are measured as a function of incident-photon energy E 1 . Thus the spectra depend on both E 1 and E, represented in two-dimensional RIXS plane.</p><p>The purpose of this experiment was to study the reduced-wave-vector (k) dependence of the RIXS plane in NiO. The possibility for this Bloch wave vector dependent RIXS <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> in NiO is offered by the very localized and well-separated nature of different excitation channels that probe different final states, which in turn depend on the band structure. The measurements were done by tuning the incident-photon energy E 1 around the nearly-quadrupolar pre-edge (around 8.332 eV) of the Ni K absorption edge, shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. We used the G = [3 0 0] reciprocal space vector as the zone center. This allowed us to work close to 90 • scattering angle, minimizing nonresonant quasielastic scattering. The RIXS maps of NiO in the d-d excitation region have typically three discernible peaks, which we label A,B, and C, at E = 1 eV, 1.6 eV, and 3 eV, respectively. In NiO in the D4h symmetry the possible intermediate states with 3d 9 configuration are of a 1 and b 1 symmetries. We have noted [2] that it is more probable for the peak A to be originated from the a 1 state, and for peak B from the b 1 state. By observing the E 1 -dependence of the peaks A and B, it becomes possible to infer the relative splitting of the unoccupied a 1 and b 1 states as a function of k (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> right panel). Further analysis and theoretical calculations are currently being done, and a manuscript is under preparation. [1] H. <ref type="bibr">Enkisch et al., Phys. Rev. B 60, 8624 (1999)</ref> [2] S.
