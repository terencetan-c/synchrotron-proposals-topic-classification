The crystals obtained so far are quite small and difficult to reproduce. In order to facilitate the crystallization process, we have envisaged to cocrystallize the PBP3 with a Fab fragment of a monoclonal anti-PBP3 antibody. The antibodies 103-12F were chosen on the basis of their dissociation constant ( Kd~5.10 8 M -1 ). IgG were produced by cell culture and purified on protein G Sepharose. The Fab fragments were prepared by papain digestion and protein A Sepharose purification. The anti-PBP3-)DE fragments crystallize as long needles or prisms of 200x200x400 µm 3 .</p><p>Crystals of the 3%3)DE FRPSOH[ grow as large and very thin plates within 24 hours.</p><p>During the 3 shifts allocated at ID14-EH3 in June 99, we have tested two types of PBP3 crystals, the PBP3-Fab complex crystals, and we were able to collect a 2.2 Å data set on the Fab crystals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3%3</head><p>We have tested needles of 10x10x300 µm 3 and bipyramidal prisms of 100x100x400 µm 3 , obtained under roughly the same conditions. Several cryprotectants have been tried.</p><p>Only two prismatic crystals diffracted to 6-7 Å resolution, with a very weak signal/noise ratio. Partial data sets were collected in order to estimate the space group and the unit cell parameters. They were first analysed with the MOSFLM package, but no unit cell emerged clearly. We have then used the XDS package. We can choose either the best score 'quality of fit' with an orthorhombic space group (oP) and an We may think that the conditions of data collection are correct and that the poor resolution can be attributed to the size and quality of the crystals, correlated with the size of the unit cell. We will try to enhance the size and quality of the prismatic crystals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>$QWL3%3 )DE</head><p>It has already been demonstrated that the crystallization process may be "facilitated" by the help of cocrystallization with antibody fragments. We have applied this method in order to have more control on the crystallization process of PBP3. Fab fragments of antibodies 103-12F against PBP3 have been crystallized</p><p>easily. The determination of this Fab structure will be the first step in case of the resolution of the PBP3+Fab complex structure by molecular replacement.</p><p>The collected data diffracted to about 2.2 Å resolution. Using the XDS package, we have found the space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 with the unit cell parameters : a = 70.94 Å, b = 105.82 Å, c = 127.74 Å. The total number of reflexions is 21,690 with a completness of 44% at 2.2 Å resolution with an R factor of 6.2%, and 89% of completness at 3.0 Å resolution with an R factor of 5.4%. Assuming about 50% of solvant, the Fab fragment crystallized as a dimere. We are applying molecular replacement in order to solve the structure of the Fab fragment.</p></div>

The maximum resolution that we have observed for those crystals was of the order of 8 Å. No data were collected.</p><p>Since this is very preliminary results, we are very confident that the quality of those crystals could be improved by controlling the crystal growth speed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>approximative unit cell of a = 133.2 Å, b = 137.5 Å, c = 515.0 Å, or the highest symmetry with a tetragonal space group (tP) and an approximative unit cell of a = 135 Å, b = 135 Å, c = 515 Å. With a unit cell volume of about 9 432,225 Å 3 and with a molecular weight of ~56,000 daltons, the number of molecules per asymmetric unit (N au ) can be estimated between 8 to 12.</figDesc></figure>
