Assouline* Casali Institute of Applied Chemistry, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel Prof. J.-F. Gérard, Laboratoire des Materiaux Macromoleculaires, INSA Lyon, France Report: We investigated the morphology of transcrystalline layer in isotactic polypropylene based composites, using a 8 µm wide beam. The results on monoclinic α transcrystallinity are reported in: Lamellar Twisting in α Isotactic Polypropylene Transcrystallinity Investigated by Synchrotron Microbeam X-Ray Diffraction, E. Assouline, E. Wachtel, S. Grigull, A. Lustiger, H.D. Wagner and G. Marom, POLYMER 2001, 42 (14): 6239-6245 Abstract:</p><p>We report for the first time details of the morphology of α isotactic polypropylene transcrystallinity induced by aramid fibers as determined by high spatial resolution X-ray diffraction. We suggest that the parent lamellae nucleate at the fiber surface with the crystallite c-axes parallel to the fiber axis, twist one quarter turn about the parent a*-axis within an approximate distance of 25 µm and then continue to grow without further twisting. The result is unexpected since lamellar twisting has never been observed in pure α spherulitic polypropylene.</p><p>Morphological changes under tensile stress were studied for α transcrystallinity for low strains. The sample was held in an Instron 25 kN servohydraulic testing machine available at ESRF. At any low strain, up tp 2%, the X-ray patterns remain unchanged at a given distance from the fiber and were consistent with the above-reported results. It appears that the strain is generated predominantly within the amorphous phase whereas the crystal structure and the orientation of the lamellae remain unchanged. These results are interpreted in terms of anchoring of the transcrystalline layer to the fiber surface.</p><p>(The relevant article has been submitted) γ orthorhombic polypropylene transcrystallinity was studied following the same procedure as for α transcrystallinity. It was found that the growth axis of the lamellae (the c-axis) is radial and that the ab face is randomly oriented on the fiber surface. This finding was supported by the absence of epitaxial relationship between the lattice of Kevlar aramid fiber and the lattice of γ iPP crystals.</p><p>(The relevant paper is in preparation)</p></div>		</body>
