<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The long term aim of this experiment is to determine the crystallographic structure of the membrane protein cytochrome b 6 f complex (cyt b 6 f) which catalyzes the transfer of electrons between the photosystem II and photosystem I in oxygenic photosynthesis, and couples this transfer with the translocation of proton through the thylacoÔd membrane. It is a membrane protein that contains 2x8 polypeptide chains with a molecular weight of ca 200000 Da. It is one of the last large complex protein of photosynthesis whose structure is still not known, although the soluble portions of the Rieske protein <ref type="bibr">(Carrell et al., 1999)</ref> and the cytochrome f <ref type="bibr">(Martinez et al. 1997</ref>) have already been determined. Some functional and structural homologies exist with the cytochrome bc 1 of the respiratory chain of mitochondria, whose structure is known(for a review see <ref type="bibr">Berry et al, 2000)</ref>.</p><p>The goal of these first series of experiment was to test cristallisation conditions in order to find a stable and diffracting crystal. Several stabilisation and cryo soaking conditions have been tested starting from non diffracting crystals and ending up to crystal diffracting to 3.5 Å. The space group is either I222 or I2 1 2 1 2 1 with cell dimensions of 100.9 x 170.6 x 352.3 . The crystal diffract weakly but a decent data set could be collected with Rsymm 0.06 (0.21 at 3.5 ) and 99.8 % completeness. The crystals have a size of about 0.2 x 0.1 x 0.4 mm, and are quite difficult to handle as it is often the case for membrane protein (Matthews coefficient Vm 3.8 3 /Da without taking into account the detergent), smaller crystals yield often better diffraction pattern.</p><p>This results are very encouraging to pursue these experiments (improvement of resolution, search of heavy atoms and functional derivatives).</p></div>		</body>
