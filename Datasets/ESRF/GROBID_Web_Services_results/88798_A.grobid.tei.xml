<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>4. Are the obtained results at this stage in line with the expected results as mentioned in the project proposal?</p><p>YES. All the experimental date collected at BM26-B are used to demonstrate that premature failure of laser sintered PA12 is due to a faster voids formation kinetics than compression moulded PA12. The outcome of the experiments is briefly described below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Constant strain rate experiments were performed at 10°C, 24°C (below Tg=42°C) and 120°C at 5•10 -4 s -1 strain rate by means of a Linkam TST350 tensile stage equipped with a 200 N load cell and a temperature control. The tensile stage was placed in front of the x-ray beam horizontally oriented with respect to xray detector (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> ). Two sets of experiments were performed:</p><p>1. simultaneous Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and 1-D Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (1-D WAXD) patterns were recorded with a Pilatus 1M detector and a Pilatus 3K respectively, with a pixel size of 172x172 𝜇𝑚. The sample to detector distance was 2410 mm for SAXS measurements and 275 mm for the 1-D WAXD measurements. 2. 2-D WAXD patters were collected with a FReLon 2000 with a pixel size of 46.3 𝜇𝑚 and placed at 147 mm from the sample.</p><p>For both the two sets of experiments the acquisition time was of 2 seconds and the x-ray wavelength was 0.9799 Å. To correct the diffracted intensity for the actual sample thickness during stretching, the incident beam Iinc is measured by means of an ionization chamber and the transmitted intensity, Ip, is recorded with a photo diode.</p><p>incident x-ray beam Iinc stretching direction intensity at the photo diode Ip 12 mm 5 mm 6 mm x y z</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Based on our previous work, the mechanical response under constant strain rate of moulded and sintered PA12 is comparable at high temperatures, i.e. temperatures above the glass transition temperature, where inter-lamellar deformation processes are known to be predominant, and becomes larger at temperatures below the glass transition, where intra-lamellar processes contribute more to the stress. For these reason, the tensile test where performed below room temperature, 10, °C at room temperature, 24°C and far above the glass transition, 120°C. As expected, the yield stress as well as the strain at break of moulded PA12 is higher than sintered samples. This behaviour reverses at 120°C where the strain at break is comparable and the yield stress of sintered PA12 is higher than moulded. These results can be explained considering that the higher degree of crystallinity and the thicker lamellae of sintered samples can support higher stress at high temperature but they lead to low stress and brittle failure at low temperatures. Indeed, the SAXS results indicate that cavitation is higher in sintered than moulded PA12 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). This difference in the void fraction reduces when PA12 is tested at high temperature where sintered behaves better than moulded PA12. The SAXS results reveal that moulded and sintered PA12 show two different cavitation processes: in sintered samples, voids originate with their normal parallel to the stretch direction and subsequently elongate and orient with their normal perpendicular to stretching direction. In moulded PA12, voids are formed already oriented with their normal perpendicular to stretch. strain [-] 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 φ void [%] 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 stress [MPa] 0 20 40 60 80 100 T=10°C moulded sintered strain [-] 0 0.1 0.2 φ void [%] 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 strain [-] 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 φ void [%] 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 stress [MPa] 0 20 40 60 80 100 T=24°C moulded sintered 0 0.1 0.2 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 strain [-] 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 φ void [%] 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 stress [MPa] 0 20 40 60 80 100 T=120°C moulded sintered strain [-] 0 0.1 0.2 φ void [%] 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2</p></div>
