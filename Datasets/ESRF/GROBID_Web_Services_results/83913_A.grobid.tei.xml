<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: Goals</head><p>The goal of the proposal was to investigate the structure of hydrogels as function of applied strain, temperature and composition. We used a strain-controlled rheometer coupled to a couvette geometry to analyse simultaneously the mechanical and structural properties of the hydrogels. The effect of temperature in the structure of hybrid hydrogels and hydrogels composed of polymers with different side groups were performed in a temperature-controlled capillary setup.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Motivation</head><p>Cells interact with their surrondings both chemically and mechanically. Over the last years increasing evidence indicates that the mechanical communication takes place in the nonlinear regime. Nearly all biological materials are designed such that they access this nonlinear regime at relatively low strains. When higher strains are applied to such systems, they stiffen up, protecting the cells inside. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1</ref> Recently, we published a new synthetic polymer that shows exactly the same strainstiffening behaviour as many biopolymers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> ; The cytoskeleton as well as the extracellular matrix are, however, not composed of single component hydrogels only. They are made of a mixture of polymers and networks and show a complex mechanical properties. Mixture of different polymers or the addition of a functional crosslinker with our synthetic polymer increases the variables of the system and can be able to mimic the complexity of cells. Further, the addition of a second network, forming a hybrid hydrogel, can present unique mechanical properties. Our group recently published a combined rheoSAXS study <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3</ref> , where we proved how the structure of the hydrogel changes at the thermally induced gelation point. In the performed experiments, we aimed to understand the molecular strucuture of our synthetic hydrogel when combined with 1) functional crosslinkers, 2) polyisocyanice-tetraethylene glycol and 3) poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Setup</head><p>A standard SAXS set-up with a sample-to-detector distance of 3.5 meter was used. The 2D Pilatus1M detector collected low contrast images and detected fibril alignment as a function of strain. A DHR2 rheometer (TA Instruments ) was used to deform the hydrogels in the (non)linear regime. The gel was formed in a polycarbonate (PC) Couette cell with a peltier temperature controller. In the second part, a capillary setup with temperature controller was used to analyse 1) the effect of the side group in the material composition and 2) hybrid hydrogels and the structural changes with temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>RheoSAXS experiments:</p><p>1) Functional crosslinkers: In the RheoSAXS setup, we analysed the hydrogel composed of polyisocyanide (0.4 wt%) chemically crosslinked with CCMV capsid (cowpea chlorotic mottle virus). Previous study in our group had demostrated that the capsid crosslinkers rupture after certain stresses are applied and therefore a conventional rheometer could follow the global mechanical changes with the rupture. With the scattering profile of the capside, we could prove that indeed is the rupture what causes the observed changes in the mechanical properties. Unfortunately, due to the differences in the geometries -we previosly used parallel plates for our tests, and the RheoSAXS setup has a Couette -the capsides did not fracture with the applied stress. Further research has to be done to determine the conditions in which the capsides can be fractured with the Couette geometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capillary setup: 2) Composition</head><p>Hydrogels composed of polyisocyanide-triethylene glycol (PIC-3EG) and polyisocyanidetetraethylene glycol (PIC-4EG) were analysed at the temperatures T=5 °C, 35 °C and 50 °C. Such small difference in the side chains, either composed of 3 or 4 ethylene glycol groups, causes the hydrogels to gelate at 18 °C and 40 °C, respectively. We investigated the scattering pattern for a mixture of the polymers and concluded that PIC-4EG bundles beyond its gelation temperature and a hybrid is formed. The results were published and can be found in: P.H.J. Kouwer et al. / Chinese Chemical Letters 29 (2018) 281-284.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Hybrid hydrogels</head><p>Double-network hydrogels composed with PIC and PNIPAM were analysed in the temperature range from 30 °C to 40 °C. The network of PNIPAM collapses with temperature above 32 °C and strains the PIC network. The goal of the experiments was to determine the structural change in the PIC network with the PNIPAM collapse. We measured two compositions of PIC/PNIPAM, with concentrations of 4/6 and 4/17 mg mL -1 in order to assess the impact of concentration into the network. As a control, samples of the single-networks of PNIPAM and PIC were analysed. The scattered data were fitted with a combination of Kholodenko worm-like chain term and correlation length model to describe the polydisperse PIC network: I network (q) ∝ I 0 [1 + (qξ) p ] -1 , where I(q) is the experimental scattering intensity. The result (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) showed that as the PNIPAM collapses, the pore size of PIC network halves and the network becomes denser. The results brought essential insights to the understanding of the interaction between both components at molecular level. The SAXS results are included to a manuscript recently submitted: Cytoskeletal Stiffening in Synthetic Hydrogels, submitted, P. de Almeida, M. Jaspers, S. Vaessen, O, Tagit, G. Portale, A. E. Rowan, P. H. J. Kouwer.</p><p>0.1 1 10 -8 10 -7 10 -6 10 -5 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 1 4 / 0 4 / 6 PIC / PNIPAM (mg mL -1 ) T = 30 C, 40 C Intensity (cm -1</p><p>) q (nm -1 ) 4 / 17 Figure 1. SAXS scattering profiles of the PIC/PNIPAM (4/17) double-network at temperatures 30 (blue fit) and 40 °C (red fit). The PNIPAM contribution was subtracted. The high angle concave curvature (in all samples) originates from the scattering contribution of the fraction of dissolved PIC chains not incorporated in the gel that is well described by a Kholodenko worm-like chain term with contour length L = 72 nm, persistence length l p = 8 nm and radius R = 1.0 nm. The fits (solid lines) follow the correlation length model, with the exception of 4/6 at 40 °C, which also contains a Kholodenko bundle term with L B &gt; 200 nm, l p,B &gt; 200 nm (both outside the experimental window) and bundle radius R B = 6.7 nm. The inset tabulates the key fitting parameters, correlation length ξ (in nm) and Porod exponent p. Data is vertically offset for better visualisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>SAXS is a reliable technique to study the structural changes of our polymeric system. With that, we could understand the stiffening effect of our PNIPAM/PIC system and to evaluate the bundle process of a mixture of PIC with different gelation temperatures. For the rheo-SAXS system, more investigation is required with the couvette apparatus.</p></div>		</body>
