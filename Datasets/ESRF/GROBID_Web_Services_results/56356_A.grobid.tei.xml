<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The anti-tuberculosis drug pyrazinamide (C 5 H 5 N 3 O) is a wellstudied model system in the field of molecular crystals displaying polymorphism -a phenomenon that greatly troubles the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years a lot of effort has been put into improving density functional theory based computational methods that estimate the free energy of different polymorphic phases, which requires an accurate description of the lattice dynamics in the full Brillouin zone. Especially, the estimation of the low-frequency phonon modes is difficult to obtain for molecular crystals with many atoms in the unit cell. To advance, the lattice-dynamical models require experimental data that can directly compare the computed and observed phonon dispersion relations at any momentum transfer, and not exclusively indirect experiments that estimate integral properties. This is possible through inelastic X-ray and neutron scattering on single crystals, however, this is unexploited for molecular crystals.</p><p>In the recent experiment (April 2015) at beamline ID28 at ESRF we aspired to attempt to measure the low-frequency phonon dispersions in different polymorphs of pyrazinamide for the first time. The aim was to demonstrate that the scattering power of millimeter-sized pyrazinamide crystals is sufficient enough to obtain a useful inelastic that can be directly compared with lattice-dynamical calculations based on density functional theory. We were capable of producing single crystals of all four polymorphs of pyrazinamide of millimeter-size that are kinetically stable at room temperature. It was possible to record nice inelastic spectra from all four polymorphic phases without any problems. All measurements were performed as energy scans with an energy resolution of 3 meV with the sample at room temperature. We focused on energy transfers that are suitable for acoustic and the low-energy optical phonons i.e. below an energy transfer of 25 meV. The momentum transfer was chosen along high-symmetry paths between two Bragg reflections, trying to obtain information about the dispersion of both transverse and longitudinal phonon modes, and along directions significant to the stacking of molecular planes.</p><p>As an example of the data quality, we show four representative datasets in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> α, β, γ and δ of measurements on the α, β, γ and δ polymorphs of pyrazinamide, respectively, along the path between two Bragg reflections in reciprocal space. The points of reciprocal space, which we have measured at, are given in the legend in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. In general, it is clearly possible to observe signatures of both transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonon modes in the data. However, the data needs to be complimented by calculations of the acoustic phonon dispersions to reveal the number of modes responsible for a given peak etc. We are currently in the process of obtaining these calculations.</p><p>In summary, we have studied an interesting molecular system with inelastic X-ray scattering on single crystals to obtain information about the dispersion of the acoustic phonons, in particular, of different polymorphic phases. The experiments were highly successful and we managed to measure along several paths in reciprocal space for all four polymorphs of pyrazinamide. This resulted in benchmark data that is crucial for the validation and development of lattice-dynamical models for molecular crystals. All in all, these pilot inelastic scattering experiments on molecular single crystals of pyrazinamide are considered highly successful.</p><p>[1] N. Wahlberg, P. Ciochon, V. Petricek, A. Ø.
