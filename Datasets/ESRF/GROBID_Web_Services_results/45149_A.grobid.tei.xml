<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sabrina Sartori</head><p>Storage of hydrogen in a safe and efficient medium is a major challenge for the introduction of hydrogen as an energy carrier for mobile applications. One of the most promising directions is the use of hydrogen as energy vector for vehicular applications in the form of solid storage material based on nanoscaffold hydrides. When dealing with nanoporous materials small-angle scattering gives invaluable information that can help to develop the most suitable solid material. Recently, we used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) performed at ESRF to characterize nanosized hydrides confined in carbon scaffolds. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> We found that the integration into the scaffold of sodium alanate stabilizes the size of the particles upon heating, while the bulk powders undergoes changes.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> Nanoscale particles of Mg( 11 BD 4 ) 2 infiltrated in a activated carbon scaffold (AC1) were also studied by SAXS and their behavior compared with the bulk powders. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We observed that upon heating up to 400 o C the nano-confined particles maintain their size distribution and the decomposition affects only the particles surface. On the contrary, the bulk powders showed a significant modification of particle size and surface under the same conditions.</p><p>We consider these data useful in the interpretation of the relation between the structural changes during the confinement and the improved hydrogenation properties of the nanocomposite hydrides compared to the bulk powder alone.</p><p>During the experiment MA-1175 we investigated new hydrides and/or new scaffolds. Hydrides as bulks and infiltrated in cmk-3 carbon scaffolds were studied. They were bulk Mg(BH 4 ) 2 in liquid NH 3 and the respectively two infiltrated samples with 70% and 40% hydride loading, respectively. Bulk Ca(BH 4 ) 2 in liquid NH 3 and the respectively two infiltrated samples with 70% and 40% loading were also measured.</p><p>In situ SAXS patterns were collected at the beam line (BM26B) at the ESRF in Grenoble, France. The wavelength was 0.954 Å, and the sample was contained in a 0.8 mm boron-silica glass capillary and heated under dynamic vacuum from room temperature (RT) up to 500 o C or 600 o C at a constant heating rate of 3 or 5 o C min -1 . Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) was recorded during the SAXS acquisition. The data obtained were integrated and put on a linear scale by means of the Fit2D program.</p><p>The hydrides were dissolved in liquid NH 3 and successively infiltrated in carbon scaffolds. Once infiltrated, the release of hydrogen in case of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 infiltrated in cmk-3 reached a maximum at 50 o C lower temperature compared with the behaviour of the bulk alone. In the case of Ca(BH 4 ) 2 in cmk-3 the behaviour seemed to be the opposite. When dissolved in NH 3 , Mg(BH 4 ) 2 tends to form the complex Mg(BH 4 ) 2 * 6 NH 3 , with different characteristics then Mg(BH 4 ) 2 alone. SAXS performed on the bulk powders displayed values of the slope parameter (α) between 3 and 4 in all q-ranges as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. This is consistent with a system with very big particles with rough surfaces. Once loaded inside the scaffold this hydride shows different decomposition temperatures and a fractal-like behaviour with values of α lower then 3, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The loading degree seems to play a role in the fractal behaviour and this aspect has to be deeply investigated, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>   Ca(BH 4 ) 2 powders follow a complicate desorption behaviour. Preliminary investigations via SAXS indicates very small particles when infiltrated in cmk-3 scaffolds, being the values of α lower then 3 even at high q, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> in the case of cmk-3 / Ca(BH 4 ) 2 40% loading.</p><p>100 200 300 400 500 600 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 T, degC α High q cmk-3 / Ca(BH 4 ) 2 loading 40% Demokritos A detailed analysis of the collected SAXS and WAXS data will be necessary to understand the decomposition behaviour of the samples and will suggest the suitability of them as materials for hydrogen storage.</p><p>50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 2.45 2.5 2.55 2.6 2.65 2.7 T, degC α Low q cmk-3 / Mg(BH 4 ) 2 loading 70% Demokritos 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 2.7 2.75 2.8 2.85 2.9 2.95 3 T, degC α Low q cmk-3 / Mg(BH 4 ) 2 loading 40% Demokritos a b</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: α parameters from SAXS of bulk Mg(BH 4 ) 2 in NH 3 .</figDesc></figure>
