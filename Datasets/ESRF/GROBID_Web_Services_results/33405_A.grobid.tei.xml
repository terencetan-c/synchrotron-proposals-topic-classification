<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Report:</head><p>Much work is devoted nowadays to provide a detailed knowledge of the structural, chemical, spin and magnetic behaviour of magnetic exchange coupled ferromagnetic (FM) / antiferromagnetic (AF) interfaces in order to better understand and to optimize the exchange bias, both on the FM and on the AF side. AFM oxides like hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3 ) belong to the most promising candidates to play the role of the AFM pinning layer in spin-valves and tunnel-junction devices. It has a high Néel temperature (T N =955 K) and good corrosion resistance. Its growth conditions using atomic oxygen assisted molecular beam epitaxy growth are now well established. Cobalt has a high Curie temperature (T C =1388 K) and the resulting Co/α-Fe 2 O 3 interface is expected to have high magnetic stability. In the present experiment we have investigated the crystalline structure of Co layers during their in-situ growth in order to complete previous magnetic and Xray absorption spectroscopy data (recorded at SLS-SIM, BESSY-UE46 and ESRF-ID08).</p><p>An epitaxial 20 nm thick α-Fe 2 O 3 /Pt(111) layer was prepared in a dedicated setup at the CEA-Saclay laboratory and was mounted in a portable UHV chamber on the ID01 diffractometer, using horizontal surface scattering geometry. The surface was successfully cleaned by annealing under a partial pressure of oxygen prior Co deposition. The α-Fe 2 O 3 layer was found of good crystalline quality (surface mosaic spread about 0.5°) and the interface between α-Fe 2 O 3 and Pt(111) revealed a very well ordrered dislocation network (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). These features were quantitatively addressed through extensive in-plane rocking scan measurements at the location of the dislocation satellites and through the quantitative measurement (rocking scans) of the [10L] and [11L] crystal truncation rods of α-Fe 2 O 3 .</p><p>We have investigated the stucture of Co layers of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4, 12.8 and 25.6 nm thickness using an incident photon energy of 18 keV. Reflectivity scans were used to cross check the deposited thicknesses.</p><p>For all layers, in-surface-plane scans (at critical and sub-critical incidence conditions) along the high symmetry directions ([h00] and [hh0]) were recorded, as well as rocking scans on the location of each peak originating from hcp-Co and α-Fe 2 O 3 (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). Out-of-the-surface-plane scans were performed along the Co diffraction rods and along the α-Fe 2 O 3 crystal truncation rods (qualitatively and quantitatively). Grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) scans were also performed (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>) and confirmed the 3D growth of Co clusters (below 3 nm) as well as anisotropic features present in the α-Fe 2 O 3 film. Structural relaxation occurs for very large Co thicknesses (i.e. above 6.4 nm). The dislocation network propagates through the Co film after coalescence.</p><p>The epitaxial relationship could be determined as  In summary the proposed experiment has been fully carried out and the expected structural data could be recorded in good experimental conditions. The quantitative interpretation of the data is in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): (*) Dr. MOCUTA Cristian / ESRF (*) Dr. BARBIER Antoine / CEA/Saclay, DRECAM/SPCSI, 91191 Gif-Sur-Yvette (*) BEZENCENET Odile / CEA/Saclay, DRECAM/SPCSI, 91191 Gif-Sur-Yvette</figDesc></figure>
