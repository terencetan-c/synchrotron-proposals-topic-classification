<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context of the experiment</head><p>Non-negligible quantities of radionuclides (RNs) have been released in the environment in the past decades (nuclear tests, accidents etc). Although the inventory of radionuclides and in particular actinide elements has been widely studied in the hydro-and geosphere, speciation and transfer mechanisms are more difficult to assess, mostly because those elements are present at the ultra-trace scale. This proposal focuses on the description of actinide species in seawater for future understanding of possible transfer mechanisms from the hydrosphere to the marine biotope. (far below the ppb level, generally speaking). Those inventories have been generally achieved with alpha and gamma nuclear radiometry or analytical techniques. Among the environmental compartment, seawater is the most abundant and one of the most complex systems. For actinides in seawater, an approach based on complexation constants and predictive speciation diagrams has been reported. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> This approach is a useful guide to better describe the molecular speciation but lacks experimental data. We have started to explore the speciation of Eu(III), U(VI) and Np(V) in seawater on the MARS beam line of SOLEIL. 2 Eu(III) is used here as a non radioactive surrogate of Am(III) and Cm(III) that are both representative of the heavy actinide sub-family with essentially +III oxidation state and low hydrolysis tendency (therefore very mobile).</p><p>In seawater, bioaccumulation of inorganic contaminant has already been described to occur with algae, mussels, fishes and sponges that can serve as biomonitors of a metallic pollution. Among these organisms, sponges as sessile active filter feeders and have been identified as hyper accumulators of several heavy metals. Sponges are ubiquitous in the Mediterranean sea and some species have been selected as bio accumulator to better understand the accumulation mechanisms of actinides in marine organisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Experiments carried out in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Monaco demonstrated the hyper-accumulation of 152 Eu/ 153 Eu ( 152 Eu is a gamma emitter used here to follow the uptake rate) by Aplysina cavernicola. This data clearly indicates that after 15 days, limits in terms of concentration factors have not been achieved. The accumulation mechanisms are of course unknown but we have observed the presence of 200 nm scale particles localized preferentially far from the osculum (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, data obtained at the STXM beam line 11-0-2 of ALS, Berkeley).  We prepared a sponge doped with 200 ppm of 153 Eu (stable). First tests to record the XAS spectrum of Eu in the doped sponge revealed a very high contend of Fe in the sponge. This obliged us to work at the Eu L II edge but the signal is highly affected by Fe fluorescence and data with a very low signal to noise ratio (noise in k = 16 E -3 ) has been obtained. The only possibility to obtain better EXAFS data was therefore to work at the Eu K edge. Unfortunately, due to monochromator problems during the run, only one sample (the entire dehydrated sponge, grounded, pellet) could be recorded and not the fractional centrifugation samples. Because of the low doping concentration, the spectral noise at the K edge is important, but an order of magnitude less than at the L II edge : noise in k = 1.2 E -3 . Consequently, the spectral ranges had to be reduced to k = 8 (K edge) and 7 (L II edge) Å -<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> . In order to gain independent data points, we have performed a combined fit using both edges at the same time (number of independent point = 19). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the FTs of the EXAFS spectra at both K and L II edges and the corresponding fit (performed in kχ(k)). This preliminary result has been obtained with an Eu atom surrounded by 2 bidentate carbonates and complementary (4) water molecules. Coordination numbers have not been fitted (total fixed to 8) because this would have been meaningless with this noise level. The presence of at least one bidentate carbonate is deduced from the necessity to include multiple scattering paths that correspond to the distal carbonate oxygen. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the fit performed with 2 bidentate carbonate and 4 water molecules. However other ratio with fixed total coordination numbers are also possible. In parallel, TRFLS data has been recorded on the same sample. Although fluorescence data is more difficult to obtained on such solids than on liquids, the energy position (wavelength) and lifetime of the emission peak is also in agreement with an Eu carbonate complex. Quantum chemical models of Eu carbonate complexes are being performed. Those models, combined with the XAS data, will help to further define the form of the Eu particles that have been observed in the X ray image.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 : Contrast X ray image (Eu M IV,V edges) of a transversal cut of the sponge.
