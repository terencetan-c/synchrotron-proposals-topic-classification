<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the class of europium doped alkaline earth sulfides (CaS:Eu, SrS:Eu and Ca (1-x) Sr (x) S:Eu) and thiosilicates (Ca (2-x) Sr (x) SiS 4 :Eu for different values of x as well as different dopant concentrations). In these compounds Eu is normally in a divalent valence state. Measurements were also performed on Ca 2 Si 5 N 8 doped with europium and thulium, these are so-called persistent phosphors. These phosphors can glow for up to several hours after optical excitation. Since the emission is very sensitive to the coordination of the Eu, we conducted optical emission measurements simultaneously with the XAS measurements. The XAS measurements were performed at the L III edge of Eu, resp. Tm to study the valence state and the local environment. The experiment also consisted of measuring the PL-intensity and spectrum (1) by excitation with an LED before the synchrotron radiation hit the sample, (2) during the XAS measurements since the beam excited the sample and (3) by excitation with an LED after the synchrotron radiation hit the sample.</p><p>To carry out the experiments we used a fiber-coupled CCD spectrometer and a LED. On the LED an optical fibre was attached, so the light could be transmitted towards the sample. The position of the light beam on the sample was controlled by a xyz-stage. In this way we were able to measure the PL-intensities at the same spot on the sample as the position of the incoming x-rays. The CCD spectrometer was installed in the hutch and controlled by a PC from outside the hutch; the experimental setup is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Determination of the edge position, background subtraction and normalization of the raw data was done with Athena [1]. Moreover, peak fitting has been applied for the region around the edge (-20 eV to 20 eV) to quantify the ratio of RE 2+ /RE 3+ , since in some of the samples both valence state were observed in some spectra.</p><p>The PL spectrum before and after irradiation with the x-ray beam is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, no evidence for Eu 3+ is found. The intensity is the same, this indicates that the phosphor indeed does not lose its luminescent properties due to irradiation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> depicts the influence of the beam on the samples: the ratio of the beam intensity to the XLintensity ( = luminescence due to x-rays) of the samples. Since this value is constant, no special features are found. These are promising results in view of future measurement campaigns, as there was some fear the synchrotron beam would influence the state of the sample.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> the XANES data on the rare-earth doped alkaline earth sulfides can be found. The samples prepared solvothermally clearly contain Eu 3+ , which is not seen in the PL and XL measurements on the samples. This can be caused by surface defects or by Eu ions which are not incorporated in the samples.</p><p>The Fourier transforms of some EXAFS spectra are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. Those transforms suggest different positions for the Eu-atoms depending on the preparation method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Measurements on the thiosilicates:</head><p>The PL and XL measurements did not reveal any significant influence of the x-rays on the thiosilicates: no changes in the Eu-state were observed.</p><p>Although the PL-measurements only indicate the presence of Eu 2+ , the XANES spectra of the samples with low dopant concentrations (2% and 10%) clearly show the presence of Eu 3+ (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Measurements on the persistent luminescent materials:</head><p>The mechanism of persistent luminescence in Ca 2 Si 5 N 8 : Eu, Tm is not clear yet. One possible mechanism suggests the creation of Eu + and Tm 4+ ions. We used XANES spectroscopy to determine the valence state of the rare earth ions.</p><p>The spectra at the L III -edge of Eu exhibit a double-peaked white line structure, indicating a mixedvalence state of the compounds (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). We observe the presence of Eu 2+ and Eu 3+ (probably caused by Eu 3+ ions that did not fully reduce to the Eu 2+ state during sample preparation) in the spectra but no Eu + . At the L III -edge of Tm no tetravalent Tm characteristic peak was observed (not shown).
