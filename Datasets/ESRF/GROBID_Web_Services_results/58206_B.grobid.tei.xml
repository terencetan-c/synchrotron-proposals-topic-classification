<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Characterisation of iron precipitates and minerals by Fe Kedge EXAFS spectroscopy and total X-ray scattering </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report</head><p>For proposal 01-01-1009, we received 6 days of beamtime in 16-bunch mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Total X-ray scattering</head><p>The first part of the beamtime was used to collect total X-ray scattering data on amorphous Fe(III)-precipitates, namely subnanometric Fe(III)-hyroxyphosphate and Fe(III)hydroxyarsenates, formed under conditions relevant with respect to Fe, P, and As dynamics in natural groundwater resources and surface waters as well as with respect to water treatment for P or As removal. The analysis of the respective samples was complemented by analyses on reference materials (amorphous and crystalline Fe(III)-phosphate and Fe(III)-arsenate and lepidocrocite).</p><p>The scattering data were collected with the MAR detector at 55 keV incident photon energy.</p><p>Using this setup, we were able to collect interpretable data over a Q-range up to ~22 Ã… -1 for the amorphous materials. Due to the 16-bunch mode and the selected incident photon energy, 2-3 h were required for the collection of the scattering patterns of amorphous materials.</p><p>Considering the data recorded on the amorphous materials, a lower incident photon energy (with higher flux) could have been used to increase the photon flux without substantial loss in resolution.</p><p>The total X-ray scattering data collected on our samples were in line with expectations based on the previous characterization of the same materials by Fe K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy. A manuscript on the structure of amorphous Fe(III)-hydroxyphosphate and Fe(III)hydroxyarsenate based on the Fe K-edge EXAFS and PDF results is currently in preparation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fe K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy</head><p>The second part of the beamtime was used for the collection of Fe K-edge EXAFS spectra at room temperature in transmission mode, making use of the sample changer wheel for effective data collection. In total, about 60 EXAFS spectra were recorded on samples from different experiments addressing the redox properties of Fe(III)-oxides and Fe-bearing clay minerals.</p><p>A first set of spectra was collected on ferrhydrites, goethites and hematites with varying levels of Al-for-Fe(III)-substitution that will be used in electrochemical reduction experiments. A second set of spectra was collected on samples collected over the course of abiotic (electrochemical) or biotic (microbal) reductive transformation of ferrihydrite into mainly magnetite. A third set of spectra was collected on different Fe-bearing clay minerals collected after microbial Fe(III) reduction. Finally, a fourth set of spectra was collected on lepidocrocites used in experiments on Fe(II)-catalyzed ligand-promoted Fe(III)-oxide dissolution. These EXAFS results contribute to two ongoing PhD studies and one postdoctoral project.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Andreas Voegelin*; Ralf Kaegi; Stephan Hug; Thomas Hofstetter; Michael Sander Ashley Brown*; Jagannath Biswakarma*; Silvan Wick*</figDesc></figure>
