<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In order to study the structural relaxation of the two-dimensional microemulsion of stearic acid-FEP mixtures, we used Grazing Incidence X ray Diffraction. The angle of incidence of the X-ray beam was fixed to 0.85 α c , where α c is the critical angle for total internal reflection. The wavelength was fixed to λ = 1.552 Å .</p><p>The Langmuir trough, mounted on a vibration isolation system and used at room temperature (20°C), was equipped with a single barrier for the monolayer compression and with a Wilhelmy balance for the surface pressure control. The volume of the trough was 0.4 l. The diffracted intensity was recorded by a vertical gasfilled position sensitive detector (PSD). The measurement of the intensity as a function of the in-plane component Q xy of the scattering vector, integrated over the vertical component, Q z , yields Bragg peaks. The Q xy resolution provided by a Soller collimator in front of the PSD was 0.007 Å -1 . From the Q xy position of the peaks, the parameters of the unit cell can be deduced. By extracting the Q z dependence of the intensity across each Bragg peak (Bragg rod profiles), the tilt direction and the tilt angle can be determined.</p><p>Different parameters have been varied : surface pressure, length of the fatty acid (behenic acid), Cd ++ ions in the subphase (pH 6.5). Erratic results have been obtained. Nevertheless, surstructures have been observed at room temperature at zero pressure with microemulsions containing behenic acid with Cd ++ ions in the subphase at concentration of 10 -5 mol/l. So, we decided to perform systematic experiments on behenic acid (BA) monolayers with cadmium chloride in the subphase at zero pressure.</p><p>Over a cadmium concentration range 2.5.10 -6 to 10 -4 mol/l, a superlattice structure corresponding to an organized layer of cadmium ions or cadmium hydroxide complex is evidenced (see fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Contrary to arachidic acid and heneicosanoic acid monolayers spread over concentrated cadmium subphases, that display surstructures only at low temperature, a superlattice structure is evidenced at ambient temperature in BA monolayers. Compared to results obtained on arachidic acid and heneicosanoic acid monolayers, the superlattice parameters and the fatty acid parameters remain the same. The fatty acid chain length does not seem to play a role in the superlattice formation. Moreover, we have observed a degradation of the films as a function of time, which was all the more fast as the CdCl 2 concentration increases.</p><p>At a cadmium chloride concentration of 1.9 10 -6 mol/l, the superlattice structure is no longer detected. For this concentration, the sequence of phases is the same as that obtained over pure water (see fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The transition L 2 -L' 2 is found at the pressure of 14 mN/m instead of 20 mN/m on pure water and the transition L' 2 -S occurs at 26 mN/m instead of 32 mN/m on pure water. The phase transitions occur at lower surface pressure and the tilt angle of the molecular chains is lower, indicating the condensing effect of the divalent cations.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> : X-ray diffraction data in the horizontal plane, integrated over Q z (a) and contours of equal intensity vs the inplane and out-of-plane scattering vector components Q xy and Q z (b) for a behenic acid Langmuir monolayer on a cadmium chloride (1.9 10 -6 mol/l) at room temperature and at pressure 20 mN/m. The peak index correspond to the unit cell with two molecules. The diffraction pattern corresponds to a L' 2 phase. In the rectangular unit cell, the lattice parameters are a = 4.96 Å, b = 7.87 Å. The tilt angle is 10°.</p><p>The existence of a threshold of cadmium concentration is demonstrated for the superlattice formation. In order to have a better understanding of the phenomena, we use for the cadmium chloride concentration a better unit, which is the number of cadmium ion per BA molecule. Indeed, for CdCl 2 concentrations corresponding to more than 2.5 cadmium ions per BA molecule and higher, one obtains a superlattice structure similar to that previously reported in arachidic acid and heneicosanic acid monolayers. In other words, at least two layers of ions are necessary to form a superlattice. Below the threshold, these results indicate that the addition of a very low quantity of cadmium ions (around 10 -6 mol/l) in the subphase of fatty acid monolayers is sufficient to obtain more condensed phases, which can be of interest for LB transfer.</p><p>Study of the observed superlattice by grazing-incidence surface scattering can allow a better understanding of this effect.</p><p>These results are presented in a manuscript submitted to Eur. Phys. J.
