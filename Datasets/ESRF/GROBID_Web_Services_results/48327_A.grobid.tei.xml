<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The purpose of the experiment was to get structural information on crystalline biogenic hemozoin and its synthetic counterpart β-hematin. Our recent X-ray Powder Diffraction study indicated that β-hematin crystallized in two phases, whereas hemozoin consists of only a single phase. We concluded that the two compounds were not identical and proposed that they consisted of different polymorphs. Due to the rather large, triclinic unit cell the peaks in the powder patterns highly overlap revealing only three reflections from the second phase of β-hematin. By probing micrometer sized single crystals with a nano beam we would gain much more information on the different crystal structures.</p><p>At ID13 we obtained data of very high quality from both hemozoin and β-hematin. With a beam size of only 130 x 180 nm we could produce a map of the sub-micron sized crystals by Fe fluorescence and subsequent obtain diffraction data from different positions inside a single grain.</p><p>We found that the mosaicity of the crystals was surprisingly high as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> (left panel).</p><p>An important question was if it the identification of a possible second phase of β-hematin, which indeed was present. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows a maxiprojection of a series of diffraction images, where a cluster of crystals is being probed. The {100} reflections of the two phases are of particular interest as they are by far the most intense reflections and their d-spacings should give separated peaks on the detector. It is clear from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> that pure major-phase crystals exist, as the {100} reflection of the minor phase only is present at a small fraction of the time the {100} reflection of the major phase is present. Further analysis is required to confirm the unit cell of the minor phase and if pure minor-phase crystals exist as well. The purification process of biogenic hemozoin may have caused some cluster formation. Furthermore the amount of crystals was very sparse and the crystals died in the beam. But we managed to obtain several data sets of hemozoin. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> is seen a maxiprojection of hemozoin. We only see the most intense {100} reflection in this case. More crystals are a requisite in a future experiment. It seems as the crystals are aligned with a certain angle between them, as they are expected to do in the malaria parasite. It could however also be a result of the purification process and should be looked further into. The analysis is not yet finished, but we can conclude that we get good data with nano beam set-up at ID13, despite the fact that the crystals are considered to be weakly scattering. This experimental set-up is splendid for structure determination of small crystals and opens up for new possibilities. Next step will be to treat the malaria parasites with commonly used anti-malarial drugs. By combining the changes in crystal structure with fluorescence spectroscopy measurements of labeled drugs, it may be possible to reveal the mode of action of the drugs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Tine Straasø, Jana Baltzer &amp; Robert Feidenhans'l all affiliated with Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 5, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark</figDesc></figure>
