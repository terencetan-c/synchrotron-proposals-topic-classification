<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract: The complement system is a fundamental component of innate immunity that orchestrates complex immunological and inflammatory processes. Complement comprises over 30 proteins that eliminate invading microorganisms while maintaining host cell integrity. Protein-carbohydrate interactions play critical roles in both the activation and regulation of complement. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) activates the lectin pathway of complement via the recognition of sugar arrays on pathogenic surfaces. In order to determine the solution structure of MBL, synchrotron X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that the carbohydrate-recognition domains in the MBL dimer, trimer and tetramer are positioned close to each other in near-planar fan-like structures. These data were subjected to constrained modelling fits.</p><p>A bent structure for the MBL monomer was identified starting from two crystal structures for its carbohydrate-recognition domain and its triple helical region. The MBL monomer structure was used to identify 10-12 near-planar solution structures for each of the MBL dimer, trimer and tetramer starting from 900-6,859 randomised structures for each. These near-planar fan-like solution structures joined at an Nterminal hub clarified how the carbohydrate-recognition domain of MBL binds to pathogenic surfaces. They also provided insight on how MBL presents a structural template for the binding and auto-activation of the MBL-associated serine proteases to initiate the lectin pathway of complement activation.</p><p>Publication: Li, K., Gor, J., Holers, V. M., Storek, M. J. &amp; Perkins, S. J. <ref type="bibr">(2012)</ref>. Solution structure of TT30, a novel therapeutic agent for complement-mediated diseases, provides insight on its joint binding to complement C3b and C3d. J. Mol. Biol. In press.</p><p>Abstract: A novel therapeutic reagent TT30 was designed to be effective in diseases of the alternative pathway of complement such as paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) and other diseases. TT30 is constructed from the first four short complement regulator (SCR) domains of complement receptor type 2 (CR2) that bind to complement C3d, followed by the first five SCR domains of complement factor H (CFH) that bind to complement C3b. In order to assess how TT30 binds to C3d and C3b, we determined the TT30 solution structure by a combination of analytical ultracentrifugation, X-ray scattering and constrained modelling. The sedimentation coefficients and radius of gyration of TT30 were unaffected by citrate or phosphate buffer saline buffers, and indicate an elongated monomeric structure with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.1 S and a radius of gyration R G of 6.9 nm. Molecular modelling starting from 3,000 randomised TT30 conformations showed that high quality X-ray curve fits were obtained with extended SCR arrangements, showing that TT30 has a limited degree of inter-SCR flexibility in its solution structure. The best-fit TT30 structural models are readily merged with the crystal structure of C3b to show that the four CR2 domains extend freely into solution when the five CFH domains are bound within C3b. We re-evaluated the solution structure of the CR2-C3d complex that confirmed its recent crystal structure. This recent CR2-C3d crystal structure showed that TT30 is able to interact readily with C3d ligands in many orientations when TT30 is bound to C3b.</p></div>		</body>
