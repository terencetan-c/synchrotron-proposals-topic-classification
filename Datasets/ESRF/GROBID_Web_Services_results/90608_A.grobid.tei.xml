<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Safety of aircraft flights depends greatly on the reliability of aircraft engines. Critical components of such engines are the high-pressure turbine blades in the hot section. To improve the strength of such blades they are solidified as single-crystals of nickel-base superalloys. However this technology cannot exclude microporosity, a dangerous microstructural defect, which forms during solidification and reduces the fatigue life of single crystal superalloys in a dramatic way. The reason is, that under cyclic loading typical for service conditions of turbine blades, rupture is initiated by crack nucleation at such micropores. Microporosity in single-crystal superalloys can be removed by Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) but the HIP-parameters like temperatur T, pressure p, and duration t have to be optimised to reach a full pore healing and minimize process costs. Opposite to this process is pore growth by interdiffusion via Kirkendall mechanism between the turbine blade and bond coat. In a first step the pore evolution during HIP was predicted by modelling. In a second step experiments were carried out to verify the modelling results and clarify the physical processes standing behind. The evolution of shape, size and distribution of pores in Ni-base superalloys CMSX-4 and CMSX-10, as well as in the diffusion couple CMSX-10/ Ni were investigated. These materials were investigated in different conditions -like as cast, heat treated, HIPed. Small samples with a diameter of d =1mm and a length l ≈10mm were cut by spark erosion for synchrotron tomography.</p><p>1. The porosity evolution in superalloy CMSX-4 during HIP.</p><p>2. The kinetics of H(omogenisation)-porosity growth in superalloy CMSX-10 during homogenization heat treatment.</p><p>3. The growth and evolution of Kirkendall pores in diffusion couple CMSX-10/Ni during high temperature annealing. 4. The porosity growth in superalloy CMSX-4 during high temperature creep.</p><p>Overall around 210 measurements were carried out with a monochromatic beam at an energy of 70keV and a flux of 200mA (7/8 multibunch mode). A tomography sCMOS-camera PCO EDGE 4.2 featuring a high resolution of 2048 x 2048 pixel was used. During the rotation of the sample station about 360° overall 5000 radiographs were taken with an exposure time of 50ms each resulting in a total measuring time of appr. 5 min for one tomogram. The 360°rotation of the sample leads finally to a total field of view of 3700 x 3700 x 2048 pixel imaging a frame of 1265 x 700 µm². From this it results that the resolution is appr. 0,34µm/ voxel. The samples were measured in absorption contrast and phase contrast tomography.</p><p>To clarify the first question samples in as-cast, heat treated, and HIPed conditions were analysed. Here HIP-temperature was constant, 1288°C, but other HIP-parameters, namely pressure p and time t, were varied. Also the effect of the initial condition (as-cast or heat treatment) -state before HIPing-was of particular interest. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the porosity and dendritic structure of the as-cast sample in a phase contrast image. As an example a selected void (yellow arrow) visible in the dendritic structure is shown in different views (x-y-, y-z-, x-z-planes, and 3D-volume). In the heat treated state (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, phase contrast image) the dendritic structure is already invisible because in this condition material is chemically much more homogenious. However, the chemical homogenisation results in additional porosity, called H(omogenisation)-porosity. Finally it could be shown that the porosity caused by casting and heat treatment is reduced continuously by HIP until no more porosity could be detected.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> CMSX-4, initial as-cast state, different views of a selected void in the dendritic structure Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> CMSX-4 after heat treatment, the porosity increases, the dendritic structure is not visible 2 nd question: For analysing the growth of H-porosity in CMSX-10 as-cast samples were homogenized at a temperature of 1350°C for different times between 2h and 128h at maximum. After a period of 4 hours the samples exhibit a weak dendritic structure and porosity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3</ref>). With increasing time the dendritic structure becomes invisible due to chemical homogenisation but the porosity grows. This porosity is localized in the interdendritic regions and therefore arranged in form of rows between the dendritic arms (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The time depending correlation between homogenisation and porosity growth has to be analysed in further investigations. a b Fig. 4 CMSX-10, as-cast and homogenized at 1350°C for 128h, voids arranged in rows (a+b: different views)</p><p>To answer the third question diffusion couples of CMSX-10 and Ni were investigated. The samples were annealed for 48h hours at three different temperatures: 1150°C, 1200°C, and 1250°C. It can be seen that in the diffusion zone (interface area) of the sample annealed at 1250°C for 48 hours the Kirkendall porosity (marked with a yellow brackett) exhibits a clear gradient (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). This is caused to fast Al diffusion. Detailed analysis have to clarify the influence of temperature T and time t on the diffusion processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 5 Porosity gradient in a diffusion couple CMSX-10/ Ni</head><p>To investigate the evolution of porosity during creep (4 th question), interrupted creep tests were carried out at different temperatures T and loads σ.

The tomograms document that porosity is increasing with increasing time. The detailed analysis of the correlation between the porosity growth and the creep kinetics is under way and will help to understand the deformation mechanisms.
