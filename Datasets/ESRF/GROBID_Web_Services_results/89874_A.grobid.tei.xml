<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>System 1: Samples from the proposal number MX-2058 were measured on 23rd and 24 th of June 2018. There were no technical problems with the beamline during the measurements. Protein tyrosine phosphatase is a 70-kDa enzyme composed of two regulatory SH2 domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2) connected to the catalytic PTP domain. There is evidence that SHP-2 exists in a closed, inactive conformation due to an interaction between N-SH2 and PTP; binding of phosphopeptides to the SH2 domain releases the inhibition by favoring an open conformation of the enzyme. Two constructs of SHP-2 were measured: the first was the wild-type, catalytically competent enzyme, the second was an inactive form of SHP-2 in which the active-site C459 was mutated into a serine. In addition, each construct was measured in complex with the allosteric inhibitor SHP099, which is thought to prevent the opening of SHP-2 even in the presence of activating phosphopeptides. Five concentrations of SHP-2 were measured to allow proper treatment of interparticle effects: 3mg/ml, 1.5mg/ml, 0.75mg/ml, 0.37mg/ml, 0.18mg/ml, in 50mM HEPES, 150mM NaCl, 5mM, pH 7.6. The SAXS curves of the catalytically competent SHP-2 reveal that the phosphatase does indeed adopt a compact fold in solution: the radius of gyration calculated from the extrapolated curves at infinite dilution (2.61 ± 0.01 nm) is consistent with the one determined from the crystal structure (2.6nm, pdb 2SHP). Furthermore, the distance distribution analysis revealed a compact fold, with a maximal end-to-end distance (Dmax) of 8.49 nm. Addition of SHP099 does not significantly affect the conformation of SHP-2 when it is not bound to activating phosphopeptides (Rg 2.61 ± 0.01nm, Dmax 8.39 nm). Therefore, it is likely that SHP099 acts by stabilizing the closed conformation of SHP-2 even in the presence of activators and preventing its opening. On the other hand, the catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 (C459S) displayed a significantly different behavior, with a greater preference towards open states even without activators. This was demonstrated by a larger Rg value (2.86 ± 0.01nm) and a more skewed distance distribution curve. In this case, addition of SHP099 caused a dramatic shift towards the compact state (Rg 2.6 ± 0.01 nm). We therefore speculate that the presence of the Serine residue in the catalytic site disrupts the physiological interaction between N-SH2 and PTP. Thus, a new inactive mutant of SHP-2 must be designed for structural studies. System 2: Samples from proposal number MX-2058 were measured on 23 rd June 2018. No technical errors were encountered during the experiments. The proposal was related to the met-T-box riboswitch from Staphylococcus aureus, which is involved in regulation of amino acid metabolism in most gram-positive bacteria. T-box RNA sense and respond to aminoacylated state of tRNA as a measure of amino acid availability and then regulate the expression of downstream genes for biosynthesis of amino acids.</p><p>The predicted secondary structure of T-box-RNA suggests the existence of several folded domains (primarily stem-1, linker and terminator) which possibly interact during the tRNA recognition. Three constructs i.e. full length T-box RNA, and linker were measured at different concentration (0.6 to 4.4 mg/ml) so as the understand the overall fold.</p><p>The data for full length T-box RNA shows interparticle interaction at higher concentration. The curves were analysed to obtain Rg values of 5.15 nm. Similar experiment with stem-1 shows higher Rg values, which is in agreement with its predicted elongated shape as compared to the full length. The data from linker indicated towards comparatively compact fold. The data obatined in these experiments will be combined with other studies to understand the overall structure of the met-T-box RNA.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Shown here are the scattering curves of the two constructs of SHP-2 (extrapolated at infinite dilution and fitted against the theoretical curve generated from pdb 2SHP), in the absence and presence of allosteric inhibitor SHP099.
