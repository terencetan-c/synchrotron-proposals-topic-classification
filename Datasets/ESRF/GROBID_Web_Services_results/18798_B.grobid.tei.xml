<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We recently solved the structure of the cytochrome bc 1 -complex from S. cerevisiae bound to an antibody Fv fragment at 2.3 Å resolution <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. This mitochondrial oligomeric membrane protein is one of the fundamental components of the respiratory chain. It catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, while the process is coupled to electrogenic translocation of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Still, the molecular basis of fundamental processes of the enzyme mechanism is not known, e.g. the oxidation of quinol, the identity of primary proton donors during quinone reduction or the importance buried water molecules shown in the yeast structure for proton transfer pathways.</p><p>The structure of the yeast cytochrome bc 1 -complex contains five tightly bound phospholipid molecules. It is known from biochemical studies that phospholipid molecules are essential for the function of this enzyme. We are investigating the role of these phospholipid molecules. Are they merely required to ensure structural integrity or are some of them -especially cardiolipin -of functional importance. We obtained crystals of a modified protein preparation, which retains a higher amount of phospholipid during purification. A data set of these crystals was collected: 2.65 Å resolution, 92 % completeness, 6.7 % R-merge. In addition, protein of standard preparations [1] was crystallized and the crystals were treated with phospholipid containing buffer. Soaking did not effect the diffraction quality of the crystals and data were collected to 2.6 Å resolution, 91 % completeness, 5.1 % R-merge. Refinement of these data is in progress.</p><p>The exact molecular interaction of the cytochrome bc 1 -complex with its substrate cytochrome c is not known. We obtained several type of small crystals of a ternary complex consisting of cytochrome bc 1 -complex, Fv fragment and cytochrome c (Type I-III). Similar to the original crystals no cryo-conditions are available. We modified crystallization conditions favouring stronger interaction of cytochrome c with the cytochrome bc 1 -complex. Although crystals can be grown very reproducibly, crystals larger than 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 mm are extremely rare. We collected a data set for one crystal at 3.0 Å resolution, 93 % completeness, 11 % R-merge at 4</p><p>°C. The crystal belong to the space group P21 with unit cell parameters a=147Å, b=166Å, c=196Å, β=104°. Molecular replacement confirmed the solution, which was obtained with the previous data set at 3.6 Å resolution. A dimer of the cytochrome bc 1 -complex is present in the assymetric unit. It cannot be concluded yet, if cytochrome c is bound in an ordered manner.</p><p>The only known structure of a co-complex from an enzyme and cytochome c is that of cytochrome c peroxidase and cytochrome c. No structures are available yet of co-complexes between components of the respiratory chain and cytochrome c.</p><p>Data collection was hampered by very low intensity of the beam (technical problem of ID14eh3). Due to a major power cut at the ESRF the data collection had to be stopped after 4 1/2 shifts.</p><p>[1] C. Hunte, T., J. Koepke, C. Lange, T. Rossmanith and H.
