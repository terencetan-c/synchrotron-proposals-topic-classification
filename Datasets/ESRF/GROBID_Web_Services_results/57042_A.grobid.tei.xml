<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Diffraction tomography <ref type="bibr">(Bleuet et al., 2008)</ref> with a resolution of 10 µm voxel size has been acquired, at ID 11, on three different porous media. The first one was a sea sand with barite and celestite that have precipitated inside its porosity (as described in <ref type="bibr">Chagneau (2015)</ref>). Initially, the experiment aimed at determining in situ and time-resolved barite and celestite precipitation. However, it appeared that the precipitation kinetics were to slwo, and this could not be measured. To circument kinetics problems, we measured samples which were previously prepared in the lab. Several aquisions were made to ensure a statistically robust analysis. In addition, a few additionnal samples where measured, in other to ensure that data aquired on the beamline could lead to a publication. These two additonnal samples consisted in a cement paste and a manganese nodule, sampled in the central pacific <ref type="bibr">Ocean (Wegorzewski et al., 2015)</ref>, that contains different nickel and copper content. On this latter sample aquision time was optimized to allow the use of Pair Distribution Function computed tomography which enables (1) to account for the 3D spatial distribution of poorly crystalline phases with micrometre resolution and (2) to determine the nature of the poorly crystalline phase <ref type="bibr">(Jacques et al., 2013)</ref> has been used (figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>The results obtained on the different porous media are now being analyzed and prepared for publications. A special attention will be paid to tomographic reconstruction in the case of cement. Indeed has already outlined by <ref type="bibr">Voltolini et al. (2013)</ref>, the problem with cement materials whenever applying routine filtering procedure is linked to the huge difference in crystallite size of the different phases and to the subsequent presence of preferential orientation, which needed to be accounted for in the raw data before tomographic images could be reconstructed. This data processing procedure is currently being performed, following a method previously published by <ref type="bibr">Voltolini et al. (2013)</ref>. Finally, we expect that on our recent work <ref type="bibr">(Grangeon et al., 2013a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Grangeon et al., 2013b)</ref> on deciphering the structure of C-S-H (the main phases forming during cement hydration) will allow us to refine filtering procedure and to be able to spatialize C-S-H structure, in particular refine and spatialize C-S-H Ca/Si ratio distribution. </p></div>			</div>
