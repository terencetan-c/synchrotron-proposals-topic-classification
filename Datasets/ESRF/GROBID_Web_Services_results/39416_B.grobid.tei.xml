<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instructions for preparing your Report</head><p>• fill in a separate form for each project or series of measurements.</p><p>• type your report in English.</p><p>• include the reference number of the proposal / experiment to which the report refers.</p><p>• make sure that the text, tables and figures fit into the space available.</p><p>• if your work is published or is in press, you may prefer to paste in the abstract, and add full reference details. If the abstract is in a language other than English, please include an English translation. • bear in mind that the double-page report will be reduced to 71% of its original size, A4 format. A type-face such as "Times" or "Arial" , 14 points, with a 1.5 line spacing between lines for the text produces a report which can be read easily.</p><p>Note that requests for further beam time must always be accompanied by a report on previous measurements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We characterized novel high transmission planar waveguides making use of the third generation synchrotron radiation. The bending magnet BM20 beamline offers high flexebility by the wide and easily accessible energy range on the one hand, giving us the opportunity of testing waveguide samples of different lengths at two characteristic energies. On the other hand, the high precision six-circle goniometer with large sample holder enables accurate sample positioning for exact waveguide characterisation without the need of rearrangement of the different waveguides measured. We used a low noise scintillation detector mounted on the diffractometer arm (712.5mm distance waveguide-detector, 0.52mm slit) for high angular resolution θ-2θ scans of the farfield pattern and the farfield tails.</p><p>We have shown the advantages of using an optimized multilayer waveguide design with a C guiding layer and a Mo interlayer embedded in Ge at a hard x-ray energie of 19.5keV in a previous ROBL beamtime (T. <ref type="bibr">Salditt et al., PRL 100, 184801 (2008)</ref>). In this beamtime we have studied the efficiency of the waveguide on a wide energy range by reducing the waveguide length. Prior limitations of the two-component waveguides resulted from the need of efficient blocking of the over-exposed beams. The beam directley above the multilayer optic must be absorbed to isolate only the waveguide We succesfully measured a series of Ge/Mo[d i = 30nm]/C[d = 35nm]/Mo[d i = 30nm] waveguides of different length l = 460μm/690μm/860μm at two different energies 11.5keV and 15keV with the In52Sn48-alloy as blocking material. The farfield pattern shown exemplarily on Fig.1 clearily identifies the expected waveguide properties. No artefacts of overexposed beams are measured. This observation is in agrement with the fact that the electron microscopy image shows wetting on the nanometer scale at the interface waveguide/InSn alloy. We obtained a maximum transmission T = 0.512 for the shortest waveguide at 15keV. The transmission of an ideal waveguide without real structure effects such as interface roughness was determined to be T = 0.846 by FD simulations . The measured and calculated values of the transmission for the considered sample series show the strong dependency on the energy and the waveguide length.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1: On the left, top: Farfield Intensity for different angles of incidence α i , along with Gaussian fits.
