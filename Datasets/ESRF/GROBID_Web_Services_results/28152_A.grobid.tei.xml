<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The beamtime allocated for MD-75 was the first time our neurovascular research group conducted any synchrotron-supported experiments. We had made first contact with the team of ID 17 in April 2003. Judging by the harmonic atmosphere in which our experiments were conducted and by the results of our first experiments, the time leading up to the experimental time had been well used. This applies to the general planning of the experiments as well as to the preparations of the animal experiments. Special thanks for the latter goes to Dr. Geraldine LeDuc and Mr. Dominique Dallery. We also wish to thank everybody who made a special effort to make possible the use of the fluoroscopy unit, the availability of which on site at ID 17 proved to be a vital component of our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments:</head><p>All experiments were conducted using adult male New Zeeland rabbits (ca. 2.5 kg).</p><p>Experimental techniques used were subtraction angiography, both conventional X-ray imaging technique (Philips BV 212 C-arch) and synchroton-supported K-edge subtraction angiography (KEDSA).</p><p>The first 4 shifts were dedicated to familiarize ourselfes with the animal modela and finding an optimal approach that satisfied the need for continous anesthesia of the experimental animals as well as a clutter-free environment for the tomographic imaging mode. Digital subtraction angiography images using conventional X-ray imaging (fluoroscopy unit) were acquired. The initial plan was to use the FreLoN detector for image acquisition, in order to take advantage of its higher resolution. However, we found that not-anticipated software problems occuring with the use of the FreLoN detector would require a longer time to be solved, before it could be used for our experiments. In order to make optimal use of the remaining experimental time, we decided to switch to the Germanium detector. This proved to be a good decision.</p><p>Within the remaining experimental time, we were able to demonstrate that: 1) Good visualization of the cerebral circulation is possible after intravenous injection of iodinated contrast agent (Iomeron 350). The lowest dose, at which the vascular tree was still (weakly) visible was determined as 0.5 ml (single shot).</p><p>2) Good visualization of the vertebral arteries is possible after intravenous injection of contrast agent with doses of 1 -to 1.5 ml / sec and total doses of 5 -7.5 ml. Considering the smallness of the animals and respectively the small diameter of their blood vessels, compared to human patients, we would expect to be able to visualize a major portion of the vessels contributing to blood perfusion of the spinal cord. The higher X-ray absorption rate caused by larger bone mass and adipose tissue would, hopefully, be offset by higher total doses of contrast agent.</p><p>3) Good visualization of the major blood vessels of a hind limb was possible after intravenous administration of contrast agent.</p><p>All three applications of i. v. angiography successfully tested during our beamtime could have implications for clinical pratice. We therefore whish to further develop the techniques (models and acquisition procedures) in future collaboration with the ID 17 team. The next step should be to test our hypotheses that a) visualization of cerebral and spinal vasculature is also possible in larger experimenetal subjects (i.e.pigs) and b) that the diameter of the smallest detectable blodd vessel is equal regardless of the size of the animal. If evidence could be found for the latter, synchrotron-supported K-edge subtraction angiography might emerge as a more patientfriendly angiographic diagnostic method for difficult neurovascular cases.</p><p>We plan to report on the results of our experiments in three scientific papers: Abstracts and references for publications will be submitted once they have been accepted and go into print. Abstracts of posters or oral presentations that will be reprinted in scientific journals will also be forwarded to the ESRF User Office.</p></div>			</div>
