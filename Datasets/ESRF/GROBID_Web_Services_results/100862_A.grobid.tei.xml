<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of the experiment was twofold. (1) Through the recording of XRD and XAS data, we studied the strtuctural and electronic changes asociated to the exsolution of silver nanoparticles; indeed, when Agdoped La0.80Sr0.15Ag0.05FeO3-d is heated in mild conditions silvere is exsolved and the perovskite matrix experiences a sieres of changes worth to be studied. (2) Once Ag is exsolved, the La0.80Sr0.15FeO3-d matrix is decorated with mental naomparicles. This materials is stable for alarge number of WS cycles; so structural and XAS study in WS operando conditions with the aim of determining in what extend the Ag-La0.80Sr0.15FeO3-d material is as stable, reversible and durable for WS application. The variation of iron and silver oxidation states, the structural evolution and the eventual growth of silver NPs were intended to be studied. As a reference three samples prepared ex-situ were studied by XRD and XAS at RT: La0.85Sr0.15FeO3-d (LSFO), La0.80Sr0.15Ag0.05FeO3-d (LSAFO) and Ag-La0.80Sr0.15FeO3-d (Ag@LSFO). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> shows the XRD patterns of the three samples, no clear differences are observed, most likely due to low level of silver content, and to the nano size of the silver exsolved particles. More information is provided by the XAS spectra collected in the Fe-Kedge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>), and the Ag-Kedge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). In the pristine materials iron is in oxidation state slightly higher than three; on heating around 200ºC the oxidation state increases most likely due to the exsolution of silver without loss of oxygen ions. Further heating induces reduction of iron most likely due to oxygen release and creation of oxygen vacancies. On its hand, silver is as Ag+ in the parent oxide, being exsolved as metallic nanoparticles. To study the exsolution process XRD patterns and XAS spectra (in the Fe-edge) were recorded on LSAFO at different temperatures from RT to 500 C in air. From XAS it is evident that exsolution occurs around 200ºC with oxidation of iron, which implies that oxygen is not released from the perovskite matrix, according to the processes described in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>). On heating further, iron is reduced, this being associated with oxygen loss according to Eq.( <ref type="formula">2</ref>). Due to experimental limitations (some beam shutdowns occur during the experiments days, and the change from Fe-Kedge to Ag-Kedge is a relatively time-consuming process) we decided to limit the XAS experiments to iron. Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)</p><p>Finally, we performed some WS cycles, recording only XRD data (due to experimental limitations). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the pattern evolution upon cycling at 800º C. Once reduced in N2, when a water-saturated stream is feed to the reaction chamber the unit cell of La0.80Sr0.15FeO3-d (matrix of the Ag@LSFO sample) contracts; conversely, in the second step when pure N2 stream is applied, LSFO expands, most likely due to the reduction of iron cations. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
