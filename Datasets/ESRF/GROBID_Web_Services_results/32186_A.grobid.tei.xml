<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>) is sensitive to temperature and thus serves as a recorder for the cooling rate of the rock. From structure refinements the Mg/Fe ++ site distribution, and Me-O bond distances, and, in turn, K D values were determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Closure temperatures were calculated to be T c = 520°C and 700°C for NWA856 and SAU130 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, respectively, which are based on calibrations of intracrystalline geothermometry of meteoritic and terrestrial pigeonite samples known from literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Under certain assumptions these values of T c allow conclusions of the cooling rate of the host rock.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample material:</head><p>Crystals with edge lengths of &lt;1µm -to 10µm were examined and only smallest crystals exhibit reflection profiles suitable for data collection and, most importantly, extraction of integrated intensity. Due to the very similar lattice constants of the intergrown pigeonite and augite lamellae an overlap of reflections from both phases occurs and the separation of reflections belonging to the two phases at low 2Θ angles proved to be impossible, especially if the mosaicity of the crystals is high. Pyroxene samples from martian meteorites have previously been considered as a hybrid between single crystals and textured powder in literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The crystal size seems to be the most important factor for determining the crystal quality. In practice, powdered sample material is placed on a kapton foil, which was scanned for good quality single grains. Data was collected at wavelengths between 0.73Å and 0.98Å and varying sample-CCD distances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure refinements:</head><p>All our samples contain a main pigeonite phase and a minor part of augite phase as concluded from the x-ray patterns. Due to the very similar lattice constants of the intergrown pigeonite and augite lamellae, an overlap of reflections from both phases occurs and the separation of reflections belonging to the two phases at low 2Θ angles proved to be not completely possible, especially if the mosaicity of the crystals is high, i.e. higher than several degrees. Therefore, three reflections overlapping the strong augite reflections at low 2θ were excluded from the refinement (110, 020, 002, which have low influence on the K D value). For the reflections at higher angles, a large contribution of augite to the integrated intensities could be precluded, due to the integration method of profile fitting. Integral intensities were derived from data processing with the XDS program package <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The refinement was carried out only for the major pigeonite phase in the low-clino space group P2 1 /c using the Jana2000 software <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results: Closure temperature of Mg-Fe order-disordering in pigeonite bearing rocks</head><p>Heating or even kinetic experiments on martian NWA pigeonites are not yet available. Therefore we used the geothermometric data published by Pasqual et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> which have determined equilibrium temperatures of Mg/Fe ++ exchange of ureilite PCA82506 and (terrestrial) pigeonites BTS308. These samples contained up to 10% Wo, an amount which is comparable to that of the martian pigeonites. The geothermometric equations used by the authors are based on the Mueller rate equation which can be fitted by an Arrhenius equation. If we assume that these geothermometric equations are applicable to the NWA and SaU martian samples, we may get at least estimates of the closure temperatures of the exchange reactions in pigeonite of martian rocks. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> includes values of calculated temperatures T c values using the constants given by Pasqual et al. <ref type="bibr">[</ref>5] SAU 130 NWA 856 K310 G1 G2 NWA722 NWA470 NWA337a Lattice parameters 9.650 8.884 5.204 108.475 9.732 8.964 5.255 108.6 9.747 8.989 5.263 108.636 9.693 8.928 5.221 108.726 9.685 8.909 5.218 108.656 9.722 8.960 5.231 108.428 Cation Distribution 0.12(4) 0.049(5) 0.05(1) 0.044(6) 0.048(8) 0.05(2) Tc 700°C From weighted average 0.049: 520°C Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crystallochemical (geometrical) parameters of pigeonite structure</head><p>The topology of pyroxene structures can be described by alternating tetrahedral and octahedral layers parallel to the (100) plane. The octahedral layer contains the M1 and M2 sites. The P2 1 /c pigeonite space group is typical for low Ca pyroxenes and contains symmetrically distinct chains in adjacent tetrahedral layers. The more extended chain is denoted as A, with smaller tetrahedra. The O3 anions are bridging atoms, shared by neighbouring tetrahedra. The M2 is also coordinated by six anions, albeit in a very distorted octahedron. The mean M2-O radius increases with the radius of the cation -this distance is therefore an indicator of the cation distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The structural data of the pyroxenes from martian meteorites SAU130 and NWA 856 are well within the trend of an almost linear dependency of Kd vs. M2-O3 distance.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Clinopyroxenes from the martian meteorites NWA856 and SAU130 were studied by means of single crystal diffractometry with synchrotron radiation at ID13/ESRF. A structure refinement was performed and the cation distribution determined. In pyroxenes, the Mg and Fe2+ cations fractionate between the non-equivalent M1 and M2 sites.
