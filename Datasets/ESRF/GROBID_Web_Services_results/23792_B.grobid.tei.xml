<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment HE1377 was aimed at investigating the effect of external pressure on the stability of the 4f-magnetism in Sm metal by using Nuclear Forward Scattering (NFS) of synchrotron radiation. The measurements have been carried out in 16-bunch mode at beamline ID22N. A new high resolution monochromator has been designed for the energy of the 149 Sm resonance (22.494 keV). This delivers a flux of 2 × 10 7 photons/s in a bandwidth of ~0.9 meV and is therefore perfectly suited for high-pressure NFS and for Nuclear Inelastic Scattering studies. The beam was vertically collimated by using a Be compound refractive lens and focused horizontally to a size of ~150 µm, matching the size of the sample in the Diamond Anvil Cell. The sample was a Sm metal foil, enriched to 97% in 149 Sm. The typical counting rates were 1-500 counts per second, allowing us to measure a single spectrum in 5-60 minutes. For this beamtime it has been possible to measure ~100 NFS spectra in the pressure range 0-18 GPa. X-ray diffraction patterns of the Sm foil have been measured at all pressures and at low temperatures to follow all structural phase transitions.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the NFS spectra measured at 3.2 K and various pressures. At ambient pressure and at p=3.4 GPa, Sm metal has the Sm-type hexagonal structure, whose unit cell consists of nine planes stacked along the c-axis. In six of these planes, the Sm atoms have a hexagonal coordination, while in the remaining three the coordination is cubic. The NFS spectra are best fitted if one assumes at the cubic sites slightly reduced hyperfine interactions with respect to those at the hexagonal sites. The magnetic hyperfine field of the hexagonal sites at ambient pressure has approximately the value of the Sm 3+ free ion. It decreases when pressure is increased to 3.4 GPa. The magnitude of the electric quadrupole interaction follows the same behaviour. When pressure is increased further, above 4 GPa (at room temperature) the structure changes to dhcp and the ratio of hexagonal and cubic sites becomes 1:1. The NFS spectra show that in this structure both types of sites have the same hyperfine interactions, probably because of the stronger interaction between planes of different coordination. The magnitudes of the hyperfine magnetic field and of the quadrupole interaction decrease as pressure increases, owing to the possible interplay of crystal field effects and conduction electron contributions. A further analysis of the spectra measured as a function of temperature at each pressure will allow us to determine the pressure dependence of the magnetic ordering temperature.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -NFS spectra of Sm metal at 3.2 K and different pressures.
