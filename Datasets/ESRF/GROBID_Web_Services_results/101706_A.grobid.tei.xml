<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Objectives. This proposal aimed at determining the nature of lattice strain, compressive vs tensile, following the ultrafast photoexcitation of hot carriers in the canonical Mott insulator (V1-xCrx)2O3. Our recent μ-XRD mapping on (V0.95Cr0.05)2O3 thin films after an electric field-driven insulator to metal transition indeed revealed a compressive lattice response, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a-b</ref>). As electric field and light pulses are both prone to generate hot carriers, we expected that photoexcitation would also induce a compressive lattice response in (V1-xCrx)2O3. Our preliminary pump-probe reflectivity study in (V0.95Cr0.05)2O3 films is consistent with this view. Overall this study might challenge the paradigm by which photoexcitation of matter always leads to a thermally-driven expansion, and suggest that Mott physics can lead to a reverse compressive behavior. This study is part of the MOTT-IA project, which aims at creating the first hardware neural network based on the properties of Mott insulators. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed and main results</head><p>We have performed time resolved X-ray diffraction on four different (V1-xCrx)2O3 thin films, whose positions in the phase diagram are indicated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 (a):</ref> (1) on a x= 0.05 sample (DET48, gap 0.15 eV, thickness 100 nm), using a pump energy at 2300 nm (0.5 eV).</p><p>We measured temporal scans in the 0-1 ns range and fluence scans up to 29 mJ/cm², as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(bc</ref>). Contrary to what we expected, a photoinduced shift towards lower Q is observed for all the Bragg peaks, indicating a volume expansion.</p><p>(2) on a x = 0.12 sample (DET 30, gap ≈ 0.25 eV, thickness 100 nm), with two pump energies (0.5 eV and 1.55 eV). Our hope was that the gap of this sample (≈ 0.25 eV ), closer to the pump energy of 0.5 eV compared to the x = 0.05 sample (gap ≈ 0.15 eV), would lead to better conditions to observe the compressive effect. However, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(d-e</ref>) shows that the shift of the Bragg peak is still towards lower Q, i.e. towards a volume expansion. Still, the smaller volume expansion observed at a pump energy of 0.5 eV compared to 1.55 eV at the same total fluence suggests the possibility of a competition with a compressive mechanism. Indeed both volume expansions should be similar if only a tensile mechanism was present.</p><p>(3) on a pure V2O3 sample (DET 44, thickness 116 nm), using the 1.55 eV pump laser. As expected in a metallic phase, the photoinduced volume change is expansive (tensile), with a much larger effect compared to the Mott insulators (PI) samples DET 48 (x = 0.05) and DET 30 (x = 0.12). Overall, the results obtained on both samples in the PI phase are surprising. We have indeed recently detected a strong (∆V/V = -1.5 %) and non-thermal photoinduced compressive effect in a V2O3 film in the AFI phase at low T (10 K). A possible explanation is that the total photoinduced stress results from the competition between two effects, one compressive and one tensile. As the tensile effect is proportional to the thermal expansion coefficient, it is expected to be larger at 300 K (where the above results were obtained) than at 10 K (where the compressive effect was detected). Moreover the laser energy used in this ID09 experiments (0.5 eV) is two or three time larger than the gap of the measured samples (≈0.15 eV for x = 0.05 and ≈0.25 eV for x = 0.12). The pump laser energy in excess with respect to the gap in transformed into heat, and hence to a tensile effect.</p><p>Our next session at ID 09 in May 2023 should help to clarify the situation, since we will measure samples with a gap much closer to the pump laser energy available at ID09 (0.5 eV), either by working at low temperature or using V2O3 sample with much higher chromium content.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure.1 : (a-b) μ-XRD mapping experiment performed on a device made of (V0.95Cr0.05)2O3 thin-film submitted to a Electric Mott Transition.
