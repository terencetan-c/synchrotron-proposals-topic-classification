<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objective of this experiment was to study the structural levels of different edible fat systems from a few nanometers to a few micrometers using microradian x-ray scattering setup. However, due to limited beam time and the absence of preliminary SAXS data, we decided to use the standard SAXS/WAXS configuration in this experiment. Instead, we performed aditional analyses of the influence of shear on the crystallization of the ediable fats.</p><p>Examples of 2D patterns for SAXS and WAXS from fully hydrogenated palm kernel oil (FHPKO), palm kernel oil (PKO), fully hydrogenated coconut oil (FHCNO) and coconut oil (CNO) are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The obtained data suggested that different structures appeared in the different type of edible fat. The polymophs of FHPKO and FHCNO appeared to be β′, however, both α and β′ forms were observed in PKO and CNO from the WAXS patterns. From the SAXS pattern, it was obvious that the scattering peaks were changed after hydrogenation of PKO and CNO to be FHPKO and FHCNO, respectively. Moreover, the thickness of the fat nanocrystal decresed after hyrogenation. This might be due to more high melting point triglycerides were formed after hyrogenation, resulting in a rapid cystallization.</p><p>In additon, the shear rate also affected the structure of the fat crystal network. The smallangle X-ray scattering (SAXS) pattern of FHPKO with the shear rate of 20 s -1 at different time are depicted in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Here it can be clearly seen that the intentensity of some peaks incresed with the increase of shear time, which indicated that change of the structure of fats at the action of shear during the fat crystallization process.  In addition, we have performed several test measurements of the pharmacologically-relevant ointments and creames.</p><p>We would like to thank the DUBBLE team and especially Michela Brunelli and Daniel Hermida Merino for the support throughout the experiment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Examples of 2D patterns for SAXS and WAXS from different edible fats (FHPKO, PKO, FHCNO and CNO).
