<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cementitious materials play a crucial role in the engineered barrier system in repositories for low and intermediate level radioactive waste (L/ILW). This type of nuclear waste contains significant amounts of the fission product 79 Se. 79 Se is of concern in waste disposal due to its long half-life (3.27•10 5 years), its presence as weakly sorbing anionic species under oxidizing conditions (Se IV O 3 2-</p><p>) and its complex speciation under reducing conditions (Se 0 , polymeric Se species and Se -II ). Predicting its long-term mobility requires a thorough understanding of the processes controlling the 79 Se sorption onto cementitious materials. The aim of the project was to assess the sorption of Se IV and Se -II onto anion exchangers such as AFm phases in cement, and to asses the fate of these sorbed anions upon changes of the redox potential.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary results:</head><p>Se K-edge (12.6 keV) extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed on wet pastes of AFm-CO 3 and AFm-OH-CO 3 doped with ~1000 ppm of either Se IV O 3 2-or HSe -II . All samples were equilibrated for 30 days. After this equilibration time, part of the Se IV doped samples were exposed to reducing conditions either electrochemically (Eh = -1.285 V (SHE)) or through the addition of 0.05 M hydrazine for 30 more days. Thermodynamic calculations showed that the Se concentrations used in the sorption experiments were sufficiently low to avoid undesired precipitation of CaSeO 3 and insoluble selenides. A Se -II solution was prepared electrochemically and the Se redox state verified with UV-Vis spectroscopy. All experiments were conducted inside a glovebox ([CO 2 ], [O 2 ] &lt; 0.1 ppm). All samples (wet pastes) and solid reference compounds were packed in plexiglass sample holders and sealed with Kapton tape. The reference solutions were kept in sealed Pasteur pipettes. In order to avoid oxidation during transport, all samples were stored in a dewar under liquid N 2 conditions. The EXAFS measurements were conducted at a temperature of 15 K using a closed-loop He-cryostat to avoid oxidation of the Se -II samples during measurements and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing thermal disorder effects. EXAFS data were analyzed and fitted using WINXAS and IFEFFIT software package. Theoretical scattering paths were calculated with FEFF8.2, including multiple scattering paths. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows XANES spectra of Se IV sorbed on AFm-CO 3 and AFm-OH-CO 3 phases, equilibrated for 30 days followed by exposure to reducing conditions for 30 more days established either electrochemically or by addition of 0.05 M hydrazine. The spectra are compared with spectra of a Se IV reference (Na 2 SeO 3 ), and an aqueous Se -II reference (a NaHSe solution, pH = 12.0). The figure shows clearly that the XANES spectrum of the sample corresponding to Se IV sorbed on AFm-CO 3 followed by equilibration for 30 days under reducing conditions in an electochemical cell, is very similar to the Se -II reference spectrum and completely different from the spectra of the other samples. Two conclusions can be drawn from these results: 1) Se IV sorbed onto AFm-CO 3 cannot be reduced within 30 days in contrast to Se IV sorbed onto AFm-OH-CO 3 . This may be an indication for different sorption mechanisms acting on the two solids. 2) Hydrazine cannot reduce sorbed Se IV although it is capable of reducing Se IV in solution. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows the Fourier transform (FT) spectra of Se IV (a) and Se -II (b) loaded AFm-CO 3 and AFm-OH-CO 3 phases. The FT spectrum corresponding to Se(IV) sorbed on AFm-OH-CO 3 phase reveals the absence of backscattering contributions beyond the oxygen shell indicating the formation of an outer-sphere complex. In the case of Se IV sorbed on AFm-CO 3 , however, backscattering contributions from three shells beyond the oxygen shell are observed in the FT spectrum suggesting the formation of a Se IV precipitate. In the case of the Se -II loaded AFm-CO 3 and AFm-OH-CO 3 samples, both spectra exhibit very similar shapes characterized by a very rich structure hinting at the formation of a Se -II secondary phase. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Outlook:</head><p>To complete this study, some additional XAS measurements are planned focussing on the measurement of Se IV and Se -II reference samples (CaSeO 3 , Na 2 SeO 3 , Na 2 Se), as well as AFm-CO 3 and AFm-OH-CO 3 samples with lower loading of Se IV and Se -II in an effort to avoid surface precipitation.</p></div>
