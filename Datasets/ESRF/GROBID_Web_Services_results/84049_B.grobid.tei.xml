<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Probing the Free Energy Landscape of Holliday Junctions By X-Ray Scattering Interferometry </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The beam time allocated to proposal MX 1911 was used to perform solution bioSAXS measurements on the basic dynamic nucleic acid motive the Holliday junction in order to probe the conformational states under varying salt conditions. Therefore, we used an emerging synchrotron based structural technique, X-ray Scattering Interferometry (XSI), to resolve the conformational ensemble of the Holliday junction under a wide range of solution conditions and to provide precise structural and dynamical information for individual Holliday junction states. XSI measures the interference pattern between a pair of site-specifically attached gold nanocrystals and thus provides absolute distance distributions that directly report on the underlying macromolecule conformational ensemble. Holliday junctions are a fundamental nucleic acid structure motif that plays a central role in genetic recombination and other cellular processes and has wide applications in DNA nanotechnology. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. gives an overview of the tested gold label pairs and Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. gives an overview on the various salt conditions. We performed 10 runs in 'flow' mode using the automated sample robot installed at BM29. Sample profiles were analyzed for radiation damage and matching profiles were averaged. Appropriate buffer profiles were averaged and subtracted from the sample profiles. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows an example of the attachment positions of the three gold label pairs XB, HB and HX and the corresponding SAXS data recorded at high salt (10 mM MgCl 2 ). As predicted from literature the junction favors the isoII conformation at high and intermediate salt. This can be seen by looking at the high distance peak (89.1 Å, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>, blue trace) which is in good agreement with the theoretical value of 93Å calculated by using a rise of 3.32 Å per base and a linker offset of 20 Å and the low distance peak for gold pair XB (52.2 Å, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>, red trace). Moreover, the low distance peak for the HB gold pair centers at 57.8 Å in isoI whereas the XB pair centers at 52.2 Å in isoII. The distance distributions obtain at low salt (30 mM Tris-HCl + 10 mM Sodium Ascorbate, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>) match with the model in literature that the junction does not adopt either of the stacked conformations but is forced to stay in an open conformation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>) due to electrostatic repulsion and insufficient screening by the low salt buffer. However, two important features can be seen comparing the distributions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). Firstly, there is a small shift between the center of the HB pair distribution and the RH distribution and a difference in variance which can be caused by the different central bases between the pairs.</p><p>Potentially, another reason can be the difference between the overall sequences of the stems. Secondly, the center of the HX distance distribution centers at 93.3 Å whereas a theoretical prediction using the planar model, 3.32 Å helical rise and 22 Å axial displacement for the labels sums up to 95 Å. However, this calculation is missing the gap in the center of the junction which should be close to the diameter of a double helix. For the lower bound of the estimation and using the diameter for the minor groove (12 Å) the total distance sums up to 107 Å whereas the upper bound using the diameter for the major groove (22 Å) is 117 Å.</p><p>These two findings strongly disagree with the current model of a square planar conformation used in many publications and give rise to a conformation which is rather pyramidal shaped. We started to collaborate with a group doing molecular dynamic simulations on the Holliday junction refined with our distance distribution in order to obtain more structural information on the motive.
