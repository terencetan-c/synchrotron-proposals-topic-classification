<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to investigate the behavior of lithium/sulfur batteries, and more precisely to follow operando the active materials morphology and composition while cycling. Combined XRD and tomography was proposed to follow simultaneously: i) the evolution of crystalline species and potentially amorphous species and ii) the changes in the global morphology of both electrodes (lithium and sulfur) and electrolyte.</p><p>In order to characterize the batteries while cycling, and not to compromise the electrochemical behavior and standard cycling rates, initial experiments were carried out combining two-dimensionally resolved XRD and tomography.</p><p>Four cells were fully characterized both by tomography and XRD technics. We aim at investigating important parameters such as different c-rate, pressure and loading (see table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) in order to see their influence on the system. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The two first days of the experiment were dedicated to beamline alignment and setting up of the cell and characterizing the system. . During third and fourth days, we performed the operando XRD/tomography on the "Cell 1" by varying the C-rate. "Cell 2" was characterized during the fourth day and the increase of the pressure could be analyzed. In the fifth and the sixth days, we analyzed the "Cell 3" by varying the cell assembly with a highly but not controlled pressure. In the last day, we performed XRDCT by probing only the solely region of interest, such as positive and negative electrode, and limit the scan for the electrolyte part, in order to collect data at adequate rates.</p><p> We were able to follow the morphological changes while cycling, a segmented image allows to follow the evolution of the different active species (see figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). For this preliminary analysis, we clearly see the precipitation/dissolution of active sulfur (S 8 ) and the evolution of sulfur which is reproducible while cycling. The lithium electrode could also be followed notably in term of density and thickness. However, all tomographic data are not fully analyzed yet, and we hope to quantify and map the complete and complex state of the species in the battery more deeply.</p><p> The XRD analysis is still ongoing and the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) in the electrolyte region (mostly) will also be carried out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>We have successfully performed operando combined tomography/XRD experiment on four Li/S batteries while cycling. Different parameters were tested and we better understand the influence of each on the system, such as electrochemistry, morphological change and evolution of active species. In addition, it would be very interesting to pursue the operando investigation up to prolonged cycle (10 th -30 th or 50 th cycles), in order to see the impact of ageing on the processes occurred in the cell. Probing solely important slices with higher resolution (sub-µm) could allow extracting dynamic parameters (kinetic of sulfur particles dissolution and precipitation for instance) by analyzing quantatively the cell and thus getting a deeper understanding of the active material behavior.</p><p>This experiment opens up the possibility to characterize the batteries on length scale from microscopic to macroscopic and we believe that this coupled approach will permit to get a deeper understanding of the performance limiting degradation phenomena that occur in batteries in general.</p><p>What can be improved:</p><p>The rotative contacts have to be improved in order to limit their impact on the electrochemical performance (noise, disconnections). This will be the case when the new diffractometer with build in rotating contacts will be installed later this year. In addition, an improved data acquisition method now available allows a huge increase in data collection rates without loss of quality, and will allow the characterization of the entire battery by XRDCT in future measurements.</p></div>			</div>
