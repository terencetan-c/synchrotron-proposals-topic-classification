<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was the observation of critical fluctuations of a order-disorder phase transition in a metal-hydrogen system by coherent x-rays. Some metals like niobium or vanadium dissolve large amounts of hydrogen (H), up to concentrations of one H atom per metal atom. Hydrogen is located in the metal lattice on interstitial sites and expands the lattice. The long ranged elastic displacement field in the metal lattice causes an indirect elastic interaction between the hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen in these metals behaves in many respects like a lattice gas showing phase transitions depending on hydrogen concentration c and temperature T. Analogous to the solid phase in a lattice gas there are ordered hydrogen phases at lower temperatures in many metal hydrogen systems. In the case of VzH there are two ordered phases. Hydrogen in the low temperature phase (PI) modulates the host lattice leading to a superstructure Bragg reflection at (h/2 h/2 0). With increasing temperature a continuous phase transition occurs to the high temperature p2 phase. In the p2 phase there is no equivalent modulation of the host lattice, therefore the superstructure reflections disappear associated by the appearance of critical diffuse scattering. The observation of the critical scattering near the critical temperature T, with coherent x-rays offers the possibility to study the dynamics of the critical order-disorder fluctuations. The disappearance of the superstructure reflection (l/2 l/2 0) of the low temperature phase with increasing temperature was observed using coherent x-rays from the undulator source (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>A two dimensional x-ray CCD detector was used to detect speckle patterns caused by the domain , structure of the VzH crystal. To obtain sufficient time resolution time series were taken at every I temperature by measuring 1000 patterns, each of one second duration. Although the jump rate of hydrogen is very high, the dynamics of order-disorder fluctuations should slow down drastically near the critical temperature T,. Therefore below T, an uncorrelated signal dominated by static domains is expected (static speckle pattern) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) whereas near T, dynamic patterns are expected with a characteristic temperature dependent fluctuation correlation time. By choosing temperature steps of 0.2 degrees close to the phase transition we searched for a temperature with a fluctuation correlation time falling in the accessible range of 2 to 1000 seconds. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the disappearing of the superstructure Bragg reflection due to the pr-p2 phase transition. Every point represents the summation over 1000 single pictures (1000 seconds) from the CCD detector. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows one of these static speckle patterns (below T,).</p><p>In order to detect fluctuations a fourier transformation of the intensity of one chosen speckle over a time serie was calculated. Due to this every pattern had to be corrected for dark current and background intensity. This was made over the whole temperature range with different single speckles. No significant periodical structure could be found.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Intensity integrated over static speckle pattern from the (l/2 l/2 0) superstructure bragg reflection.</figDesc></figure>
