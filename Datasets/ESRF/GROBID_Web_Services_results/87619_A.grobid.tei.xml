<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Experiment CH-5337, performed at the ID22 High-Resolution Powder-Diffraction Beamline, aimed to get information on the role of CO2 in tuning the performance of the ultrafast molecular rotor H2BPEB [H2BPEB = 1,4bis(1H-pyrazol-4ylethynyl)benzene] when introduced as a spacer in the crystal structure of a metalorganic framework (MOF) through in situ and operando high resolution powder X-ray diffraction (HR-PXRD) at different temperatures and CO2 loadings, through the gas handling system described in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. During the experiment we took advantage of the same experimental set-up to study another MOF, namely: Fe2(BDP)3 [H2BDP = 1,4bis(pyrazol-4-yl)benzene], <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> which is characterised by a 3D network with 1D triangular channels. The peculiar shape of its channels and its good Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area (1230 m 2 /g) prompted its investigation as CO2 storage material. Indeed, it was probed in CO2 adsorption, revealing a CO2 uptake capacity of 298.0 cm³/g at PCO2 = 0.99 bar and T = 195 K <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Aiming at extending this work, we evaluated the N2:CO2 selectivity with breakthrough experiments, flowing a N2:CO2 ~85:15 v/v mixture through a column containing the activated MOF at different temperatures (T = 273, 303, 323 and 353 K, total gas flux = 20 mL/min). As a general trend (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), Fe2BDP3 can selectively adsorb CO2 over N2 with a CO2 adsorption capacity inversely proportional to the acquisition temperature. Moreover, the separation process can be repeated at least 11 cycles (T = 303 K, activation T = 393 K under He flux of 20 mL/min), with a slight performance loss, but no evidence of crystallinity loss. HR-PXRD in situ and operando measurements were performed working at 27.5 keV (λ = 0.451 Å, calibrated with the Si NIST standard SRM 640c at room temperature). Fe2(BDP)3 was activated and introduced into a 0.5 mm-diameter borosilicate glass capillary in our lab prior to the experiment. The capillary was first aligned, then connected to the gas handling system. The sample was further activated at 453 K under vacuum (10 -6 bar) by means of a turbo vacuum pump for approximately 2 h. All the measurements were carried out on the same capillary, changing its position to avoid radiation damage; an equilibration time of 15 min was applied at each CO2 pressure before acquiring the HR-PXRD data. The latter were collected at T = 273 and 298 K, while varying the CO2 loading in the pressure range 0-8 bar. Prior to CO2 dosage, space group and unit cell parameters were validated performing whole powder pattern refinements (TOPAS-Academic V6) on the data collected at 0 bar at both temperatures. The high quality of the HR-PXRD data enabled us to perform the planned structural study at T = 273 and 298 K. The framework was built up starting from the ambientconditions crystal structure [2] and refined with the Rietveld method working on the 0 bar data. The two independent ligands and the CO2 molecule were modelled as rigid bodies. For both ligands, the presence of orientational disorder affecting the central phenyl ring was taken into consideration. The primary CO2 adsorption sites were located by means of the Simulated Annealing approach and then refined through the Rietveld method. Comparing the HR-PXRD data of Fe2(BDP)3 upon CO2 adsorption (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>), neither loss of crystallinity, nor amorphization or phase transition were observed in the studied range of temperatures and pressures. A preliminary whole powder pattern refinement showed (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>) a first unit cell volume contraction in the CO2 pressure range 0-1 bar, followed by a slight expansion (V &lt; 1%), both related to CO2 loading. In order to localise and quantify the adsorbed CO2, assessment of the guest position and orientation followed by Rietveld refinement was successfully performed as detailed above. Three primary adsorption sites with different occupancy were invariably identified, irrespective of the essayed conditions. Interestingly, both at 273 and 298 K, the applied CO2 pressure affects the degree of positional disorder featured by the central phenyl ring of one of the two independent ligands. The amount of CO2 adsorbed increases applying higher pressures and is inversely proportional to the adsorption temperature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Monte Carlo simulations to further strengthen the correctness of the experimental findings are currently in progress. Our structural insight will provide key information to shed light on the chemical and structural properties a host should possess for efficient CO2 adsorption and separation at rather mild conditions.</p></div>
