We have developed a different kind of set-up, which is known from visible light optics as shearing interferometer. Here, the incoming plane light wave is not split into two completely separated branches but merely sheared by a small angle. For this purpose we fabricated Silicon diffractive optics with high aspect ratio structures by electronbeam lithography and wet chemical etching. Similar to previous experiments with linear Fresnel lenses, the effective structure height of the phase gratings was tuned to optimum by tilting the devices with respect to the beam <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. We successfully tested this interferometer for photon energies 12.4, 15 and 24.8 keV. The basic set-up is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The first grating splits the incoming wave into the +1 st and -1 st diffraction orders. The interference of these two wave-fronts results in a pattern of interference lines, which is analyzed by the second diffraction grating. The relative phase of the two beams determines how the incoming intensity will be distributed over the analyzer's diffraction orders. We used a Si&gt;111&gt; Bragg crystal to separate the zeroth diffraction order. By a slight angular misalignment of the two gratings we obtained an interferogram of Moiré-lines with excellent visibility. The set-up was not sensitive to mechanical drift or vibrations. We used 100 and 200 µm diameter poly-styrene spheres as well defined phase objects to investigate the possibilities of differential phase imaging. A change of the orientation of the Moiré-lines is observed, which is directly linked to the difference in phase of two beam separated some tens of micons (depending on the grating pitches, separation, and the x-ray wavelength). A large number of interferograms for different experimental settings (energy, alignment, etc...) were recorded with a FRELON camera. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows a series of interferograms taken with different degrees of misalignment of the gratings orientation.</p><p>The obtained interferograms are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). This shows, that a reconstruction of unknown phase objects from such images could be possible. Our method may therefore open up a new possibility visualize an object with enhanced contrast, which could help to reduce the applied doses in x-ray micro-radiography. Another application is to analyze the wave front distortions caused by reflective x-ray optics.</p><p>A publication on these experiments to be submitted to Applied Physics Letters is presently under preparation. Future work will address two problems: 1) the Bragg analyzer used in this experiment made the aligment of the set-up very complicated and caused a great loss in intensity as only one diffracion order was used for image formation. We intend to make it obsolete by taking a highly absorbing second grating.</p><p>2) The flux at the used bending magnet was by far too low to do the alignment of the set-up using live images. The use of insertion device radiation will be necessary for future work.</p><p>We gratefully acknowledge the help of beamline scientist Eric Ziegler in this experiment.  </p></div>

On one hand this opens up the possibility to perform a large number of completely new scientific experiments. On the other hand the problem to maintain the quality of the generated radiation throughout all optical components of a beam line arises. The most sensitive method to measure the distortion of a wave front relies on the use of interferometers. A set-up for a Mach-Zehnder type interferometer for hard x-rays was introduced by Bonse and Hart [1]. It consists of three partially transmitting Bragg crystals used as beam splitter and recombining elements. The main technical difficulty of the Bonse-Hart set-up lies in the extreme demands with respect to the mechanical stability of the optical components.</figDesc></figure>
