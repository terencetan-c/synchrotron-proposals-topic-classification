Burada* *National Centre for Cell Science, S. P. Pune University, Pune-411007, India Report:</p><p>For the allocated beamtime at CM01 beamline, we were able to collect a decent dataset (~4120 movies) for ligand bound form of Delta receptor using the Krios Cryo-Electron Microscope. With the help of the local contact (HONS Michael), we loaded 7 grids in the grid loader containing ligand bound protein. First we screened the prepared grids and selected the best grids with good ice thickness and particle distribution. We chose grid no.7 and marked good squares with intermittent ice thickness imaged. The following parameters were adjusted using grid hole of each square:</p><p>Magnification: 130,000; pixel size: 1.067; spot size: 6; with a total dose of 40.38е-/Ȧ2; fractions (# frames): 40; exposure time: 5s; images per hole: 3; amplitude contrast: 10%; drift correction was set once per grid square and autodefocus was set once every 3rd grid hole; Energy filter was set to 20еV and the data was collected in super resolution counting mode. The data collection was monitored using the ExiMX interface; data processing (motion correction and CTF estimation) was done simultaneously as the data was collected as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In addition, data collection statistics was performed by the system to measure the resolution distribution across movies, average motion per frame and astigmatism. Unfortunately, due to Gain reference issues with Gatan detector a few hours of data collection were lost. In total, 4120 movies were collected, out of which 3800 were good and 320 were bad containing gain reference issues and drift in movies.</p></div>		</body>
