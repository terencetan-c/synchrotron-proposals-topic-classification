The main aim of the study was to verify a formulated empirical rule about interplay between adsorption height of organic molecules and the surface work-function (cf. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, progress report on SI-1645).</p><p>During experiment, we prepared a monolayer of PTCDA on Cu 3 Au(111) surface according to preliminary developed preparation protocol (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Carrying out X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, needed for developing of fitting model for C1s and O1s core levels for proper evaluation of NIXSW data, we observed a minor but noticible shifts of coresponding peaks during first 15 minutes of X-ray exposure. We interpreted this as a beam damage of organic layer induced by (a) (b) arbitrary choice of used acquisition time due to significant dweel times, we developed a way to proceed with NIXSW such that at each "fresh" spot of PTCDA/Cu 3 Au(111) sample only two XPS spectra (5 minutes each) at different photon energies from one NIXSW sequence were recorded; after that the sample was automatically moved to another "fresh" spot until the whole required range of photon energies (E Bragg ± 3eV) was used. Thus an intact state of PTCDA/Cu 3 Au(111) interface was investigated with NIXSW. For comparison, NIXSW dataset at already irradiated sample spot was acquired as well. These experimental data are under evaluation now. Using the high stability and high transmission of recently installed at ID32 electron analyser SPECS Phoibos 225, during SI-2186 experiment we also investigated the adsorption height of PTCDA molecule at Ag(100) surface. Previous attempts to study the PTCDA/Ag(100) interface (SI-1451, SI-1645) failed because of low stability of the previously used analyser. During SI-2186 experiment we succesfully prepared a monolayer of PTCDA on Ag(100) and obtained a full set of XPS and NIXSW data on it. Corresponding data are under evaluation.</p><p>[1] A. <ref type="bibr">Hauschild et al., PRB 2010. 81, 125432.</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig. 1 (a) SPA-LEED (University of Bonn) and (b) convential LEED (ID32, ESRF) of 1ML PTCDA on Cu 3 Au(111)</figDesc><graphic coords="1,415.48,596.44,135.84,135.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
