<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Ce LIII and Cr K edge spectra were fittect to linear combinations of the standard reference materials using Athena, and the Mn K-edges were fitted to a linear regression of the standards, the final fits for each sample are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. We have derived the amount of Fe, Mn, Cr, and Ce that are reduced during melting from the original oxidation state in the feed to the final oxidation state in the melt, for the HLW-NG-Fe2 feed. Overall, Mn reduces the most, by 1.44 oxidation states, i.e. a change from 4+ to 2.56+ as an average of all of the Mn in the final glass. This change theoretically contributes 5.25 g/kg of glass of evolved O2, and actually the oxidation state of the iron in the final glass remains 3+, therefore no net contribution to O2 evolution comes from a change in Fe oxidation state. A reduction in Ce contributes a further 0.005 g of O2 per kilogram of glass, and the final oxidation state of Cr is greater than the original, so oxygen consumption has occurred at a rate of 0.010 g/kg of glass, leaving the final total oxygen evolution due to these species at 5.201 g/kg of glass, none of which is from a change in Fe oxidation state. In summary of the O2 evolved during melting of HLW feeds and</p><p>the contribution to foaming behaviour, it is not sufficient to focus only on the behaviour of Fe2O3, despite it being the most abundant species. In this feed, particularly, Mn has a higher contribution to total evolved O2, and in fact the contributions of species present in very small quantities, Cr and Ce, become important at higher temperatures where gases can be trapped beneath a viscous melt. In combination with evolved gas analysis and feed expansion tests, the O2 evolution will help to determine the optimal reductant for melting.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1 Fe K-edge XANES Spectra HLW-NG-Fe2, HLW-NG-Fe2-II, Sucrose and Graphite samples for 600, 800, 1000 and 1150 â„ƒ.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,243.00,651.36,159.60,101.16" type="bitmap" /></figure>
