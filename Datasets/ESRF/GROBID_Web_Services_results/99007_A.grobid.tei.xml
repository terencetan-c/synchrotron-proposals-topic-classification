<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Although all shifts were used, the ESRF beam dropped several times and there were several optics stabilization windows due to those inconveniences. On the other hand, we had a leak search for low temperature baby chamber measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) Epsilon iron oxide -Fe2O3 thin film on MgAl2O4 (111) substrate</head><p>An epitaxial epsilon iron oxide -Fe2O3 thin film on MgAl2O4 (111) substrate was measured on cooling to low T. We aquired HKL scans and rockings at temperatures -193ºC, -163 ºC, -133 ºC, -103 ºC, -73 ºC, -23 ºC, and RT.</p><p>Several long range H and L scans were tested to find suitable regions were film and substrate can be probed probed together. Specific diffraction spots were defined to aquire rockings for peak width assessment. A composition of acquired H,L scans is shown in Fiugre 1(a) of the mapped region in the [1-10](111) substrate plane. The first impresion is matching the expectation and no traces of other iron phases (like gamma or alpha) are identified. For the temperature dependence L-scans around H=2 were acquired for different temperatures, this scan includes 2 substrate and 8 film difraction peaks, which should allow a precise determination of the lattice expansion of substrate and film, respectively. Note that the map shown in (a) is acquired without baby chamber. Nevertheless, in the measured L-scan sufficient film (eFOepsilon Fe2O3) and substrate (S -MAO -MgAl2O4) reflections are labelled in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>(b) and in an amplified region in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(c</ref>). Slight variation of the peak position with temperature is observed. Extraction of lattice parameters and combing the results from H,L and rockings is in progress. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Epsilon iron oxide -Fe2O3 thin films on flexible mica (001) substrate</head><p>In-situ bending experiments for -Fe2O3 thin films on Mica substrates are intended to reveal the degree of mechanic coupling in these complex Van-der-Waals heterostructures, and consequently the possible effect of mechanical deformation on the magnetic anisotropy. These layered substrates can be thinned by cleaving and are flexible below 30 µm thickness. The aim is to probe the mechanical deformation of the epitaxial layer by bending the substrate in-situ. Nevertheless, the alignment of the thinned mica substrate, resulted to be rather difficult. Flourflogopyte mica is a layered silicate commonly with a high amount of stacking faults and often presents in-plane twinning. To allow handling and bending, the mica susbtrates were thinned (cleaved) to about 20 µm thickness and taped between Kapton tape, inevitably inducing additional defects. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> shows a selected detector frame of a main substrate reflection, used to calibrate the sample orientation. A large range HL map was acquired (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) and multiple split and deformed substrate peaks are observed. A selected rocking was acquired for substrate (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>) and epitaxial thin film (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>,f) The multiple split and deformed substrate spots are reflected in the thin film maps, too. We deduced that this is due to overall surface waviness (20 µm thick susbtrate on Kapton tape) and partial substrate cracking during the sample preparation. Several intents to align along the corresponding 90º film direction failed, previously determined lattice parameters (by laboratory powder diffraction) might be not exact enough to set a precise orientation matrix. We know from experience that these substrates present a much wider spread in quality, compared to single crystalline oxide or semiconductor substrates.</p><p>Finally, only one direction could be measured and both the temperature and the bending procedure were suspended in favor of an alternative sample grown on a rigid single crystal BaTiO3 substrate. The results are exposed in the next section. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Alternative sample of epsilon iron oxide -Fe2O3 thin films on BaTiO3 (111) ferroelectric substrate</head><p>To answer the question if mechanical deformation is an effective route to strain the functional oxide layer, as an alternative sample set, we tried to determine the effect of elastic strain transfer to the film during temperaturedependent structural phase transitions of BaTiO3. BTO is a ferroelectric substrate with several structural phase transitions once close to -90ºC, 0ºC and +120ºC. Due to the configuration used, we tried to assess the transitions at -90ºC and 0ºC. We measured RT  -30ºC  -70ºC  -130ºC. Thus the tetragonal  orthorhombic  rhombohedral BTO phases. The substrate peak shifts to lower 2 values and thus the lattice spacing slightly increases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>), while transiting from tetragonal to orthorhombic structure, this is compatible with reported structural data. On the other hand, the film peaks (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>) show a shift to higher 2 values and thus reflect a compression with respect to RT. This suggests mechanical coupling of film and substrate, as one of the aims is to clarify if the mechanical strain is effective to modify the magnetic anisotropy of the epsilon phase. The lower T transitions from orthorhombic to rhombohedral phase is also well visible in the substrate reflection, although 2 values of the film appear to change to a lesser amount than in the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition. This is an important experimental detail, as it is a first step to interpreting the very small change in magnetic anisotropy observed for epsilon iron oxide phase grown on both flexible mica and BaTiO3 single crystals. Further detailed analysis of multiple reflections and rocking curves may shed further light on this system. Also in comparison to thin mangetic films in spinel phase, which in both substrates, show significant changes of the magnetic properties due to mechanical deformation in contrast to epsilon iron oxide phase. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) epsilon iron oxide -Fe2O3 thin films on YSZ substrates with different surface orientation</head><p>Three samples of epsilon phase on YSZ substrates were explored to check the feasibility of determining the structural differences of epsilon phase with different surface directions and amount of formed domains. Similar to the previous samples we acquired large range reciprocal space maps. YSZ(100) and ( <ref type="formula">111</ref>) show (00L) oriented with multiple in-plane domains forming, the observed pattern match the expected domain formation of 6 and 3 respectively. The epsilon film on (110) oriented susbtrate is clearly different: the observed pattern matches 2 domains forming with (00L) epsilon being oriented along {001} crystal directions. For further studies, the acquisition conditions should be improved to allow better overlap in the reciprocal space maps. The bulk YSZ substrates lattice parameters have to be revised, as on rotation of the sample the desired diffraction planes could not be found, we conclude that the supposed YSZ bulk lattice parameters were not precise enough (provider depending Y substitution might be the origin). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 (a) HL-scan for eFO/MAO(111) thin film at room temperature.
