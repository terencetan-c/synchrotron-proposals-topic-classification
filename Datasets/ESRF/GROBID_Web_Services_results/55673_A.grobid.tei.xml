<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A detailed structural investigation during H 2 temperature programmed reduction (TPR), CO 2 temperature programmed oxidation (TPO) and isothermal cycles (H 2 -He-CO 2 -He) was performed on Fe 2 O 3 -CeO 2 materials using in situ XAS and XRD. The aim was to understand the role of structural transformation leading to deactivation. Based on our previous study, the structurally most interesting (10wt%Fe 2 O 3 -CeO 2 , TEM) and the catalytically most active material (80wt%Fe 2 O 3 -CeO 2 , activity tests) were investigated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), both in as prepared and cycled state. In addition to this, a model Fe 2 O 3 -CeO 2 material with Fe:Ce = 1:1 mole ratio was equally studied.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>• H 2 -TPR and CO 2 -TPO experiments were performed at a uniform ramp rate of 20 o C/min with short XANES measurements (5 min) to a temperature of 700 o C with a dwell time of 5 min. Each CO 2 -TPO included re-oxidation with air during dwell time, as high-temperature O 2 treatments can induce important structural phase changes which counteract material deactivation. Each treatment was preceded and followed by a room temperature EXAFS scan to study the local structural evolution compared to its fresh/pre-treated state. The study was carried out at both Ce-L III and Fe-K edges in order to obtain complementary structural and chemical information from both Fe and Ce species. • An isothermal cycling study using short XANES measurements (3 min) coupled with in situ</p><p>Mythen XRD was performed at 650 o C on material with Fe:Ce in 1:1 mole ratio to study the structural changes during reaction. The XANES were recorded at the Fe-K edge. At the beginning of each XRD scan, a well-performing DUBBLE macro was used to correct 2θ angles for changes induced by shifts in the X-ray energy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed and results</head><p>The as prepared materials 10wt%Fe 2 O 3 -CeO 2 , 80wt%Fe 2 O 3 -CeO 2 and Fe:Ce in mole ratio 1:1 were subjected to subsequent TPR and TPO to investigate the material transformations.</p><p>The changes in Ce-L III XANES white line intensity enable to follow the oxidation state evolution in 10wt%Fe 2 O 3 -CeO 2 during TPR as seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>. The final XANES spectra after reduction show the formation of Ce +3 state. The information from the full EXAFS scans after each treatment will enable to distinguish the structural differences after the reduction and re-oxidation treatment. The k 2 -weighted spectra at the Fe-K edge of 10wt%Fe 2 O 3 -CeO 2 represent the signals of the as prepared, reduced and oxidized state as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>. The changes between the reduced state (red curve) and the other</p><p>(a) (b)</p><p>states is quite obvious. A detailed modeling of the EXAFS scan will yield the exact environment of Fe and the structural changes associated.   Similarly, the Fe-K XANES (fluorescence mode) enabled to follow the reduction of iron oxide in the sample with Fe:Ce in mole ratio 1:1. The pre-edge features after TPR and TPO remain the same, indicating the same local environment. However, the edge energy shift towards lower energy indicates reduction (red spectrum in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref>). Linear combination and detailed EXAFS modeling will yield insight in the reduction and oxidation process.</p><p>To study the role of structural transformations during redox cycling, the sample of Fe:Ce in mole ratio of 1:1 was subjected to isothermal cycles at 650 o C. The changes in oxidation state were followed by in situ XAS and XRD. The Fe-K XANES spectra clearly show the evolution of oxidation state (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>). During the reduction, the most reduced phase is metallic Fe, while the most oxidized phase resembles Fe 3 O 4 . The time resolved XRD measurements at Fe-K edge provide a clear insight in the phase changes during reaction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). From the XRD pattern, Fe 3 O 4 is reduced to FeO, while the deeper reduction to metallic Fe can be inferred only through XAS.
