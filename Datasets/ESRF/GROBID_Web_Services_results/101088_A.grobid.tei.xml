<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We conducted several single-crystal diffraction experiments for analyzing thermal diffuse scattering in Ni37Co13Mn33Ti17 single crystals. A x-ray energy of 60 keV was chosen. We measured two samples with different annealing conditions at different temperatures using the oxford cryostream. For each sample a single measurement was performed with rotating the sample with a constant speed of 1° per second around the phi axis with detector readout every 0,1°. Main experimental difficulties were to much intensity in the bragg reflections in terms of count rates an d saturation of the detector readout.</p><p>Two enhance the overall intensity in the diffuse scattering data, therefore, we conducted at each temperature 16 single measurements, which were summed up in the data reconstruction afterwards.</p><p>Applying the corresponding Laue symmetry to the data gives high quality reciprocal space maps of the diffuse scattering. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>(a), the reciprocal space map at L=0 is shown, were the distinct features of the diffuse scattering are evident. The thermal diffuse scattering can be obtained with an high quality close to the bragg peaks, as indicated by the isosurface representation in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(b)</ref>. In contrast to other shape memory alloys, no maxima originating from a phonon soft mode are visible in the diffuse rods along <ref type="bibr">[110]</ref> like directions. This does not change upon cooling. Additionally, the data shows, that the sample is in highly disorderd B2 structure, since no L21 short range order diffuse scattering is visible. By cooling below the phase transition temperature, the single crystal transforms to a monoclinic martensite, which results in a highly twinned sample. A exemplarly reciprocal space map is shown in figure 2. The satellites of the modulated martensite are along the [110] directions of the austenite, were the pronounced thermal diffuse scattering was found. After heating back to the high temperature phase, the single crystalline state is recoverd. The diffuse scattering data is used to analyse the elastic constants as precursors of the martensitic phase transition. Due to the high resolution and no artefacts from Bragg peaks the data is well suited. Unfortunately, the measurement series of the second sample was incomplete due to technical problems with the cryostreamer, nevertheless the dataset for the first sample is complete and from high quality. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): David Koch* Technical University of Darmstadt -Material Science Wolfgang Donner* Technical University of Darmstadt -Material Science</figDesc></figure>
