<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A detailed structural study has been performed on nanocrystalline BaCexTi1-xO3 ceramic solid solution with x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.30, between 100 and 400 K, with the aim of understanding the average and local structure variations as a function of composition and temperature, taking into account the effect of grain size as well. The same solid solution was already proposed in microcrystalline form (MA2315, at ID22). For this investigation we have selected the compositions BaTi1-xCexO3 with x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.30. The large difference in size between Ti4+(0.605 Å) and Ce4+ (0.87 Å) will maximize the possibility to detect variations in the local structure as well as a different evolution of the local structure with composition, to be compared with the system BaTi1-xZrxO3. The four compositions correspond to a different polar behaviour: conventional ferroelectric (x = 0.05), diffuse phase transition (x = 0.10), non-ergodic relaxor (x = 0.20) and ergodic relaxor (x = 0.30). The measurements was performed on nanoceramics prepared from nanopowders obtained by an hydrothermal-like method. The average dimensions of the grains were about 100-110 nm.</p><p>The data were collected with the 2D detector with Xrays at 80 keV, with the minimum possible distance sample-detector (which was about 50 cm), which allowed a Qmax of about 30 Å. The data are of good quality and the procedures for integration were correctly explained by the local contact.</p><p>We had a few problems with some of the images (mainly regarding the mask used during integration) but these were promtply solved.</p><p>The data analysis is still in progress, but a preliminary checked showed that the cell parameters of the studied nanopowders are in very good agreement with those of the corresponding micro-crystalline ceramics (collected during experiment MA2315). The phase transitions with temperature, being very subtle, were not observed due to the nano-grains of the samples.</p></div>			</div>
