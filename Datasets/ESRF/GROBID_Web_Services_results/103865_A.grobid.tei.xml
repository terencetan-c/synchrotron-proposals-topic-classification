<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: This study examines the stability of Fe2O3 in deep magma oceans during early evolution of rocky planets. The greater the stability of Fe2O3 in silicate melts reacting with core-destined molten Fe alloy, the more oxidized planetary surface conditions will be, affecting planetary evolution and habitability. The redox-depth profile of a convecting magma ocean (MO) has been explored previously through theoretical and experimental studies <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref> . Both experiments and first principles (FPMD) calculations affirm that a deep terrestrial MO, alloy-saturated at its base, becomes enriched in Fe 3+ , leading to relatively oxidized near-surface conditions <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">6</ref> . But previous experiments 2,3,7 are limited to ≤ 28 GPa and ≤ 3000 K and at high pressures (P), experiments and FPMD calculations conflict; e.g., at 30 GPa, extrapolation of the former suggest MO Fe 3+ /Fe T of ≥0.35 3,7 whereas FPMD suggest 0.04-0.07 4 . We used energy-domain synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy (SMS) at ID18, ESRF to measure Fe 3+ /ΣFe ratios and Fe-bonding environments in quenched silicate glasses recovered from laser-heated diamond anvil (LH-DAC) experiments in which mafic melts were equilibrated with PtFe alloys. These were used to calibrate a thermodynamic model relating Fe 3+ /Fe T ratios to magma ocean depth and applied to early evolution of rocky planets. Also, to gauge the effects of different fitting strategies on the accuracy of the SMS analyses, we analyzed a suite of mafic glasses which had previously been analyzed by conventional Mössbauer spectroscopy 2 . Sample details: We achieved successful analyses of 9 silicate-alloy equilibration experiments performed with LH-DAC from 38 GPa to 71 GPa and 3800-4400 K and ΔIW from -0.4 to +0.8. All had produced wellsegregated alloy and silicate domains, with no disseminated alloy detected in the silicate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Major and minor compositions of the quenched glasses and alloys were obtained by using the electron microprobe. SMS measurements: The Fe 3+ /Fe T ratios of quenched glasses were quantified by SMS collected at ID18 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Using secondary standards (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>), we tested multiple different fitting strategies and software implementations, but ultimately concluded that the best results were obtained using the Gaussian ratio method implemented in the new SYNCmoss software package 8 . In addition to analyses of glass only (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>), we also measured areas in which both glass and alloy or glass and neighboring perovskite (Figs. 2d, 2f) were included in the incident beam. These allowed us to distinguish the characteristics of analyses that were not purely glass, and helped assure that the accepted analyses from each experiment were those of quenched melt only. Results: SMS spectra of glasses consist of two broadened doublets derived from paramagnetic Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ . Resolved hyperfine parameters, center shift (CS) and quadrupole splitting (QS) are greater than those evident in similar glasses quenched from lower pressure 2 , and resulting Fe 3+ /Fe T ratios range from 0.20 to 0.45, diminishing with increasing pressure. When adjusted for differences in melt composition, oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ), and temperature (T), the new results are similar to the predictions from first principals calculations 4 , but melts have significantly less Fe 3+ than implied by exptrapolation of the lower pressure experimental studies 3,7 . We used the new results obtained by SMS to update a recent thermodynamic model for silicate melt Fe 3+ /Fe T as a function of T, P, composition, and f O 2 6 , by adjusting the parameters in a Birch-Murnaghan EOS. Applying this model along hot and cold magma ocean (MO) geotherm paths 9 at ΔIW-2 (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref>), the oxygen fugacity appropriate for the MO during core formation and equilibration with Fe-rich alloy, we find that Fe 3+ /Fe T reaches ~0.12 at 33 GPa and maintains approximately the same value to 80 GPa along the hot geotherm, and for the cold geotherm, the Fe 3+ /Fe T reaches maximum of 0.084 at 34 GPa and thereafter diminishes gradually (0.06 at 80 GPa). Therefore, depending on the conditions of silicate-alloy equilibration, the atmosphere above a terrestrial MO may have been comparatively oxidized, and nearly all of the Fe2O3 present in the modern mantle may have originated in the MO, without additions from bridgmanite disproportionation or hydrogen escape. Results will be presented at AGU23 in December 2023 and will also be submitted for publication. Because these results will have wide impact across disciplines (earth, planetary, and astrophysical sciences), we anticipate publication in a high profile (Nature/Science/PNAS) family journal.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: BSE image of experiment DAC93, (43.41, 3802±93 K, DIW=0.46), showing concentric structure with FePt alloy ball surrounded by homogeneous quenched silicate glass.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,416.20,37.25,149.25,119.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>

The blue asymmetric doublets are from the Be lens, the pink symmetric doublets represent ferric paramagnetic sites, and the light green asymmetric doublets indicate ferrous paramagnetic sites. The X 2 values are close to 1 for all spectra, except for the deliberately PtFe-contaminated sample, suggesting the robustness of our fitting approach. The accurate determination of the heated glass region is achieved through the co-location of optical measurements and Xray scans. The presence of a sextet in the Mossbauer spectra, (panel d), can indicate alloy contamination, though this phenomenon is not observed across all our E-SMS of DAC experimental samples.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,229.80,182.54,339.10,245.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
