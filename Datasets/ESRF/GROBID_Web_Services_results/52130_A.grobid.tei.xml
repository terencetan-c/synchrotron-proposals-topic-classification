<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>The solution structure of complement C3b is crucial for the understanding of complement activation and regulation. C3b is generated by the removal of C3a from C3. Hydrolysis of the C3 thioester produces C3u, an analogue of C3b. C3b cleavage results in C3c and C3d (TED). Analytical ultracentrifugation and X-ray and neutron scattering studies was used with C3, C3b, C3u, C3c and C3d, using the wild-type allotype with R102. In 50 mM NaCl buffer, atomistic scattering modelling showed that both C3b and C3u adopted a compact structure, similar to the C3b crystal structure where its TED and MG1 domains were connected through the E1032-R102 salt-bridge. In physiological 137 mM NaCl, scattering modelling showed that C3b and C3u were both extended in structure with the TED and MG1 domains now separated by up to 6 nm. The importance of the E1032-R102 salt-bridge was determined by binding studies of C3d(E1032) and C3d(A1032) to immobilised C3c using surface plasmon resonance. The A1032 mutant did not bind while the E1032 form did. The high conformational variability of TED in C3b in physiological buffer showed that C3b is more reactive than previously thought. Because the E1032-R102 salt-bridge is essential for the regulatory breakdown of C3b by Factor H, the functional difference between the major C3S (R102) and disease-associated C3F (G102) allotypes of C3b was experimentally verified.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>In the alternative pathway of complement activation, factor H (FH) is the most important regulator of active C3b and a hydrolysed form termed C3u, also known as C3 H20 . It had been long assumed that these form a 1:1 complex. Here, we show that the C3u-FH interaction is bivalent, with independently functional Nterminal and C-terminal regions. By analytical ultracentrifugation, size-distribution analyses resolved separate peaks for 1:1 and 2:1 complexes of C3u-FH in 137 mM and 50 mM NaCl buffers. In 137 mM NaCl, the 1:1 complex was predominant with a dissociation constant K D of 0.59 μM. X-ray scattering analyses showed that the maximum dimension of the C3u-FH complexes was 30-33 nm, showing that FH did not form a more compact structure in the complex. Molecular modelling based on known structures for FH, C3u, and the FH-C3b and FH-C3d complexes accounted for the experimental sedimentation coefficients of the complexes. The models also accounted for the C3u-FH scattering curves. The scattering fit for 137 mM NaCl revealed unbound C3u and FH and a 1:1 C3u-FH complex, leading to a K D value of 0.22 μM. The scattering fit for 50 mM NaCl revealed 2:1 complexes. Because two independent sites for C3u binding to FH were identified, together with no conformational change in FH, our results suggest a revised mechanism for FH regulatory control in which the N-terminal C3u/C3b degradation and C-terminal FH binding to host cell surfaces occur independently at opposite ends of FH.</p></div>			</div>
