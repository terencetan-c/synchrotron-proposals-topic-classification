<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this project (Proposal number: 20171113 ; Experiment number: 3202812) is to establish a link between microstructural features of melt-grown metallic composites and the orientation of the co-growing crystals. This is key to improving our understanding of the formation of textures in eutectic materials. Fundamentally, the challenge is to develop theoretical tools for predicting the self-organizing growth dynamics of eutectics and the anisotropy of the interphase boundaries in the solid. In practice, micro-diffraction analyses at BM32 (J.-S. Micha) aim at determining the crystal orientation relationships (ORs) between neighbouring crystals of the two eutectic-solid phases [the cubic Al-rich terminal solution (Al), and the tetragonal intermetallic Al2Cu] on a local scale in eutectic solidification microstructures of thin Al-Al2Cu metallic films. Synchrotron radiation permits to make non-destructive measurements through a sapphire-plate substrate.</p><p>-Results and the conclusions of the study: -Thin Al-Al2Cu films (thickness ≈ 9-14 µm; lateral dimensions 8×50 mm 2 ) are enclosed between two singlecrystal sapphire (Al2O3) plates. They were prepared by plasma sputtering and solidified at INSP. The thickness of one sapphire plate was reduced to 200 µm. Two solidification methods with real-time optical observation were employed: (i) directional solidification, and (ii) rotating directional solidification (RDS) that permits to vary continuously the orientation of the solid with respect to the growth axis. We selected samples containing typically 2-4 lamellar-eutectic grains (each being supposedly uniform as regards the orientation of the crystals) of a few mm each. Non-destructive Laüe micro-diffraction allows one to map the orientation of the alternating (Al) and Al2Cu crystals over selected regions, with good transmitted signal through the 200-µm thick Al2O3 substrate, and an actual resolution much better than the size of the smaller crystals (≈5 µm). This provides a means for distinguishing between different grains, and gaining information on the degree of mosaicity, if present, within a given grain.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Each Region of Interest (ROI) was scanned, and an x-ray detector used to collect a characteristic fluorescence of copper for revealing the microstructure of the actually scanned area (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The raw output data are a set of Laüe patterns for each ROI. For each sample, we also measured a Laüe pattern on a reference Ge crystal fixed on the sample surface for fine angle-scale calibration, and another one on the sapphire plates. Let us now take Ech62 as an illustrative example (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows a Laüe pattern measured at some point in an Al lamella. Note that, in all Laüe patterns, diffraction peaks coming from the Al2O3 single-crystal substrates could be easily identified. Using the LaueTools software, we could locate Al peaks (see mosaic image, Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>), and successfully run a best-fit procedure (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>). It is thus shown, in particular, that a (111) plane is tilted by a few degrees off the substrate. A similar analysis for a neighbouring Al2Cu lamella is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. We will extract the orientation of the crystals (rotation matrix and/or Euler angles), and look for special ORs.

The high-intensity (222) peak is close to the normal to the sample plane (2theta=80deg; chi=0 deg). a) b) Figure 4: a) Laüe pattern in an Al2Cu crystal. b) Best fit of selected peaks (blue). The (100) peak is clearly visible.</p><p>In addition to the main problem (link between crystal orientation and micrsotructural features), various questions will be tentatively addressed:</p><p>1-Is there a variation of the orientation of the lamellae during growth ? 2-In a given eutectic grain, all the lamellae of one phase are known to originate from a single crystal seed. We have to check, however, if there is, as is often suspected, a progressive rotation, up to a few degrees, of the crystal lattice of the crystals across a eutectic grain. 3-Ddiffraction peaks are often not circular (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>). This feature can evolve from one interphase boundary to the other, inside a given lamella. A detailed interpretation of that is not straighforward. -Justification and comments about the use of beam time: -The use of the synchrotron radiation was need for nondestructive analysis through a sapphire plate. Microdiffraction at ESRF in addition provides spatially resolved series of measurements, including crystal distortion, on a local scale with an unprecendented accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>-Conclusion: -</head><p>In conclusion, our micro-diffraction measurements on Al-Al2Cu solidification microstructures through a sapphire plate have been successful. The use of a reference sample without sapphire was helpful for spatial calibration. Both Al and Al2Cu crystals can be nicely indexed. The analyses will be performed more systematically. This requires not only the use of the LaueTools software, but also some image-analysis development. The distortion of diffraction peaks seems to indicate small-scale strain: do mechanical stresses develop during growth at a small distance from the solid-liquid interface, or at a much lower temperature, far from the solidification front ? This question cannot be addressed ex situ. It would encourage, and motivate one to develop in situ micro-diffraction during solidification.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Optical micrograph (hor. dimension: 200 µm) corresponding to ROI05 of ech62 ; the Al2Cu phase appears dark, the Al one is brighter.
