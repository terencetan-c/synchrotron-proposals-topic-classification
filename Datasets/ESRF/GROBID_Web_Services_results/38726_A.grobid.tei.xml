<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Indium is widely used in various technological fields (e.g. low melting-temperature alloys, solders, electronics) and lately it became relevant for the production of "high-tech devices" based on innovative nanotechnologies, therefore its consumption is expected to increase in the next years.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The recovery of indium (a chalcophile element that occurs dispersed within polymetallic sulphides instead of forming specific In-minerals) stands mainly on the zinc extraction from blende (ZnS); however it is known that In is also carried by excess-metal copper sulphides, like bornite, Cu 5 Fe S 4 , and by specific sulphidese.g. sakuraiite, (Cu,Ag) 2 (Zn,Fe) (In,Sn) S 4 . Accessory minerals from Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) massive copper sulphide ores (south of Portugal)bornite itself, tetrahedrite, mawsonite (ideally Cu 6 Fe 2 Sn S 8 ), Serich galena, Pb (S,Se)are known to carry interesting bulk contents of both In pontually concentrated <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>.</p><p>The aim of the experiment was to perform a micro-mapping of In in selected polymetallic sulphide samples from IPB, using scanning X-ray microscopy (SXM) and thereafter to probe the electronic state of indium by X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the L 3 -edge.</p><p>The bulk indium content and the main mineral phases present on these samples were previously ascertained by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with a laboratorial wavelenght dispersive system (XRF-WDS) and X-ray powder diffraction. Optical microscopy was also performed on polished surfaces embebbed in resin to select possible areas of interest.</p><p>Two types of polymetallic sulphide samples were therefore irradiated: polished surfaces and fragments. The first ones have disclosed difficulties in attaining the required vacuum level and in clearly identifying indium due to the overlaping of K Kα and In Lα peaks in the energy dispersive XRF spectrum.</p><p>An improvement on SXM analysis was attained with fresh surfaces of polymetallic sulphide fragments although the minor content of K present in most mineral samples makes difficult the micro-mapping of indium, also in low concentration. Despite this difficulty, some useful XANES spectra could be collected from bornite-rich sulphide fragments from Lagoa Salgada (LS). The In L 3 absorption edge was scanned from 3.71 to 3.79 keV in fluorescence yield (FY) mode and the energy calibration was performed using a gypsum standard.</p><p>As model phases for different coordination environments of indium (and electronic states), the metal (with a bcc structure) and the following commercial powder compounds were used: the halides InBr (In + in square coordination with one close extra-neighbour) and InF 3 (In 3+ in octahedral coordination) plus the oxide In 2 O 3cubic bisbyite-type structure with In 3+ ions occupying two different coordination environments: six equidistant oxygen anions at the vertices of a cube with two body-diagonally opposite corners unoccupied and a less regular coordination geometry for the same coordination number <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Sulphide fragments were irradiated at various points and five scans were performed per point. From a total of about 300 registered scans (50 from model compounds), 15 good XANES sum spectra were selected.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the In L 3 -edge XANES spectra collected from model compounds and fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> reproduces one of the few useful spectra collected from sulphide fragments. A remarkable feature is the "white line" [4] in the XANES spectrum from InF 3 , not perceptible for the oxide where In has the same formal valence; a similar effect was observed in the spectra collected from a sample (LS-5) where the laboratory characterization has assigned the occurrence of minute grains of bornite, Cu 5 Fe S 4 .</p><p>According to the actual results and despite the few good spectra collected so far, it is expected that a further analysis of carefully selected pollysulphide mineral grains could provide an insight into the electronic state of In, particularly when hosted by excess-metal sulphide minerals <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>.
