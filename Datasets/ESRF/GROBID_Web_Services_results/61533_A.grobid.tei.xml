<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report: 1. Background and aim of the experiments</head><p>Over the past few decades, block copolymers (BCPs) have received considerable attention as a promising platform for the synthesis of nanomaterials and fabrication of nanostructures due to their self-assembling nature into nanometer-scale periodic domains whether in the bulk or solution states. Preparing novel bio-based "hybrid" BCP systems and investigating their self-assembly properties represent a step forward towards new class of nanomaterials. Strong repulsions between natural saccharidic blocks and synthetic blocks, expressed by the Flory-Huggins parameter, enable reducing inter-domain size of nanoorganized morphologies toward sub-10 nm scale. Indeed, we have reported the first nanoorganized glyco thin film of the BCP (polystyrene-b-maltoheptaose: PS-b-MH) in sub-10 nm feature sizes, whose morphologies were precisely investigated by microscopy, SAXS and preliminary GISAXS using ESRF synchrotron beam line D2AM.</p><p>The aims of the experiments direct morphological characterization of the self-assembled thin films of oligosaccharide-based hybrid BCPs on silicon substrates by GISAXS technique. Generally, the morphologies of self-assembled BCPs (lamellae, gyroid, cylinder, sphere, etc.) have been characterized by combining scattering analysis (SAXS/WAXS) of the bulk polymers and microscopic analysis (AFM/TEM/SEM) of the thin films. However, the self-assembled morphologies of BCPs at the surfaces of the thin films are not same as those in bulk, i.e. the presence of two interfaces, air-film and film-substrate, could induce preferential order in the film, such as lateral and normal ordering to the surfaces. GISAXS technique can provide such a 3D ordered morphological information at the surface or inside of the thin film, which is very important when the BCP thin films are used for nanolithography.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experiments</head><p>GISAXS experiments have been performed on thin films made from various BCPs investigating several key parameters leading to the nano-organization such as i) the nature of the blocks, ii) the solvent vapor annealing conditions, iii) the use of a new promising microwave assisted solvent annealing route and iv) the silicon surface energies after chemical functionalizations. Scattered intensities have been recorded at room temperature during 10-100 sec exposures on a CCD detector placed in some distance from the sample holder depending on the required q range, and for incidence angles between 0.10° and 0.22° with 0.02° steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Result and discussion</head><p>The AFM and GISAXS images of maltoheptaose-b-polystyrene (MH-b-PS) 40 nm thin films coated onto plasma treated silicon wafers and annealed with THF/H 2 O (w/w) for 22h were shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. According to the GISAXS patterns, the nano-organization seems switch from horizontal cylinders (C // ) to vertical cylinders (C ┴ ) when the THF/H 2 O ratio increases from 1/1 to 15/1, and then turn to spheres (S) for pure THF annealing.</p><p>For each samples, domain spacings between 10 and 12 nm have been extracted from the distinct primary scattering peak (q*) along the GISAXS q y profile at the Yoneda peak and are in good agreement with the preliminary AFM and SAXS experiments. Higher-order scattering peaks can be observed, e.g. at 2q* (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 e</ref> and <ref type="figure">g</ref>), but some are missing, especially at 2 1/2 q* and 3 1/2 q*, which adds difficulties in the GISAXS data interpretations. Therefore the GISAXS pattern of what can be a mixture of C // and C ┴ (figure 1 f) appears quite close of the pattern of what we estimate to be S (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 h</ref>). The GISAXS image for the THF/H 2 O 15/1 annealing (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 g</ref>) is also tricky to interpret and could be C ┴ as well as S in BCC arrangement. These states of uncertainty can be overcome by extra GISAXS measurements (e.g. recording at different rotation angles along the perpendicular axis to the sample) and maybe GISAXS simulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusion</head><p>From these preliminary experiments, we obtained confirmation that GISAXS at BM02 is a powerful technics to study our systems. More experiments are needed to discriminate C ┴ of S and to go further in details, getting more information about the cylinders orientation all along the film cross-section and the effect of the substrate surface properties on these orientations. We also prospect for help in the data treatment and simulation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: AFM phase (a-d) and GISAXS (e-f for an incidence angle of 0.14°) images of MH-b-PS according to the solvent vapor annealing conditions.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,312.75,214.54,248.14,384.45" type="bitmap" /></figure>
