<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The first was a high resolution, native data set for active E.coli Amine Oxidase collected with the aim of elucidating the disorder in the active site. The data is good to 2.05A ( R,,, 0.058 for all data, and 0.19 in the last resolution shell ). Even higher resolution could not be collected as the crystals diffract anisotropically and the crystal used for data collection was mounted so that the highest resolution data was not in the direction of the two theta arm. The 2.05A Two data sets were collected for RepAl, a 2.OA native data set which required two passes, one at high resolution the other, using the detector as a small Mar, at 3.5A The combined data set has a R-of 0.08. A 2.5A mercury ( pcmbs ) derivative data set was also collected which has a R,,, of 0.05. Both data sets have been incorporated into the MIR phase calculation and work is currently under way building the initial model.</p><p>The final data collected was for crystals containing T7 endonuclease I complexed with a DNA Holliday junction. This data is useful to 3.5A. ( overall R-0.10 ) but diffraction from other, non-single, crystals was observed to higher resolution. Crystals soaked in heavy atom solutions were also shot but none diffracted to high enough resolution to merit data collection. The native complex data will be used in the future when successful heavy atom derivatives have been found. Data from DNA Holliday junction alone crystals was also collected but none of the crystals diffracted to beyond 1OA and the complete data set collected proved to be unprocessable due to a very high mosaicity and a lack of spots due to the low resolution.</p><p>We are pleased with the data collected during this beam time and would like to thank the beam line staff, in particular Ed Mitchell, for their assistance.</p></div>		</body>
