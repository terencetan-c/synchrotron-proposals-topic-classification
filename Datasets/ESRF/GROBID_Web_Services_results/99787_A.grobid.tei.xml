<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>NiTiO3 compounds can crystallize in three structures displaying different cationic distributions: ordered ilmenite-type (IL, R-3, space group 148) and LiNbO3-type (LN, R3c, space group 161), and disordered corundum-type (CR, R-3c, space group 167). Conversely to the centrosymmetric IL and CR structures, LN is a non-centrosymmetric structure that can be stabilized under high pressure conditions allowing the coexistence of antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric orders. Structuration of materials in thin films represents a valuable approach to access to high pressure states, by applying and maintaining after synthesis, strongly stressed structures (residual or epitaxial stress).</p><p>While conventional X-ray diffraction analyses enable to identify IL structure, it cannot distinguish between the polar LN structure and the non-polar CR one. The aims of MA5329 Experiment is to use synchrotron source for the analysis of NiTiO3 thin films by REsonant X-ray Spectroscopy (REXS) in order to characterize the (Ni,Ti) distribution in the cationic network along with the oxygen position and to discriminate the CR or LN structures.</p></div>

For example, the different variants in the plane of the substrate do not present similar spectra for 122 reflection (FIG. <ref type="figure">3.</ref>). This result suggests that the different variants could present either different structures or differences in cationic z displacement in relation with a potential structuration in ferroelectric domains.

In these figures, the simulated spectra for CR or LN structures are also presented for a qualitative comparison. For 226 and 112 reflections, experimental spectra are appreciably close to simulated spectra for CR structure, supporting that NiTiO3 adopts this structure on M-plane sapphire. FIG. 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIG. 2. Left:</head><p>In conclusion, a qualitative comparison between simulated spectra and raw experimental spectra suggests that the structure of NiTiO3 thin films could correspond to the CR structure whatever the substrate orientation and film thickness are. Nonetheless, this trend is not observed for every reflection and further data processing is required in order to properly identify the obtained structures. Especially, some corrections of the raw spectra need to be performed such as fluorescence corrections, re-centering of Region Of Interest (ROI) position, elimination of aberrant measurement points. This post-treated set of data will be then used for structural refinement taking in consideration all the recorded reflections to identify the space group of the thin film's structure and discriminate the CR or LN structures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>FIG. 1.
