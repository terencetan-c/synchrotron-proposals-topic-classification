<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In order to improve the base pressure down into the range of 10E-7 mbar (thereby minimizing any involuntary oxidation of the growing films) and in order to enlarge the accessible x-ray scattering range (in-plane and offplane), a new magnetron sputter depositon chamber with larger Be-window openings was commissioned at the material research station of ROBL (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>vertical scattering geometry horizontal scattering geometry</head><p>A constant bias voltage of -30 V was applied for all depositions. The base pressure at the deposition temperature of ~850°C was ~2 x 10 -6 Pa. For the fcc Ti 1-x Al x N seed layer an Ar/N 2 flux of 13.8/6.9 sccm was chosen leading to a working pressure of 0.35 Pa. The Ti and Al magnetron powers were 60 W and 20 W, respectively, leading to a composition of Ti 0.63 Al 0.37 N as near as possible to the nominal corresponding MAX ratio. In order to achieve stable growth conditions for the Ti 2 AlN MAX phase layer the deposition pressure was increased to 0.8 Pa at an Ar/N 2 flux of 39.7/2.4 sccm. The Ti and Al magnetron powers were 80 W and 26 W, respectively, leading to the Ti/Al ratio of 2/1 as required and calculated from preceding work. The energy of the incident x-rays was monochromatized to 12.917 keV (λ = 0.961 Å). Two different scattering geometries were employed: (1) low angle specular reflectivity either at a fixed incidence angle to determine the growth mode or scanned for the determination of the thickness; (2) large angle x-ray diffraction (XRD) in Bragg-Brentano geometry at stepwise increased temperatures up 1050 o C in order to determine the off-plane lattice parameter and the phase stability, respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FIG. 2:</head><p>In-situ XRD of the 10 nm thick fcc Ti 0.63 Al 0.37 N seed layer and 50 nm thick MAX phase Ti 2 AlN on the substrate MgO(111). At the higher deposition temperature of 850 o C the multiplicity peaks (000x) are clearly seen over the now much larger angular range of more than 50 o revealing basal plane growth in contrast to the non-basal plane growth at a deposition at 650 o C (M. Beckers et al., Microstructure and non-basal plane growth of epitaxial MAX Phase Ti2AlN thin films, JAP (2005) in press, compare also Experimental Report 20_02_608 Part III). On Al 2 O 3 substrate the Ti 2 AlN MAX phase is not prone to a spinell formation. However, it does not grow as well as on MgO (data not shown).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>FIG. 1: Improved sputter depositon chamber with larger window openings made of Beryllium installed into the 6-circle ROBL diffractometer.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,214.20,449.52,167.40,222.24" type="bitmap" /></figure>
