<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Crystals from different projects were collected during these experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Projects:</head><p>1. Structure of SENP6 catalytic domain, Two crystall diffracted beyond 1.8 A, they belonged to the P3 space group (sg 143) with a very small unite cell (61 -61 28 A). Unfortunately, Matthews coefficient calculations indicate that the crystal is formed by a small peptide, not more than 10 KDa, which does not correspend to the expected SENP6 protein (45 Kda). 2. Structure of novel class of metallocarboxypeptidase structure from Pseudomonas aureginosa at 1.6</p><p>A resolution, alone and in complex with two different inhibitors. Three different data sets were collected, WT and complexes, that belonged to the P21 space group (dimensions 42 83 107 A, b=96º). Data has been correctly processed and the results are in preparation for publication soon. 3. Structure of the complex between human carboxypeptidase A4 and a novel protein inhibitor from a marine organism. Two data sets at 1.8 A resolution were collected from the complex NvCICPA4. Crystals belonged to P21 space group (dimensions 69 72 80 A, b=108º) The structure of the complex and of the novel inhibitor has been solved by molecular replacement using the structure of CPA4 as a model. Results are in preparation to be published soon.</p><p>4. The last project is related to the biosynthesis and degradation of the aminoacid arginine in Mycoplama penetrans. The first enzyme of the pathway is Carbamate kinase, three data sets at 2.4</p><p>A resolution were collected. Crystals belonged to P321 space group (dimensions 51 51 174 A).</p><p>We also have crystals from the second stepenzyme from the Mycoplasma penetrans arginine degradation pathway, a protein called Ornitine carbamoyltransferasa. Two data sets at 2.3 A resolution were collected. Crystals belonged to P321 space group (dimensions 183 183 117 A) with 4 molecules per assymetric unit. The last enzyme of the pathway is Arginine deiminase, three data sets at 2.3 A resolution were collected. Crystals belonged to P21 space group (dimensions 120 128 220 A, b= 91º). Matthews coefficient indicates that there are 12 molecules per assymetric unit. These three projects are still in the refinement process, as soon as the structures are finish, the results will be deposited and published elsewhere.</p></div>		</body>
