<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>X-ray fluorescence holography (XFH) is a newly developed technique of structural characterization <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. In general, by irradiating x-rays with an energy higher than the absorption edge of an element, an interference occurs between the direct incident X-rays and those scattered by surrounding atoms. As a result, a modulation in the fluorescent x-ray intensity from the emitter element is generated and a crystal angle dependence is obtained, which is called a hologram. By a simple 2D Fourier transform of the hologram, 3D real-space atomic images can be reconstructed around a specific element. Thus, XFH provides element selective 3D images, and is effective to obtain local structures around impurity atoms. In a resonant approach to XFH, called Resonant Xray fluorescence holography (RXFH), the incident energy is varied over an absorption edge of a second element (with the energetically higher edge). The anomalous variation of the atomic form factors near the absorption edge can then be used to vary the contribution of a certain neighbouring atom and thus to provide element-selective information. The basis of the approach was outlined by Omori et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The potential of combining XFH with anomalous dispersion terms was recently demonstrated by our group [3], using a slightly different approach intended for a valence-selective investigation in a sample of yttrium oxide with mixed redox states.</p><p>The experiments of this project were planned to establish the method of Resonant X-ray fluorescence holography (RXFH) at BM02 based on a sample of Mn: Bi 2 Te 3 . This is well-known as a thermoelectric material having a large value of thermopower, but has achieved much attention as a topological insulator, where the so-called Dirac electrons with an almost zero mass can conduct on the surface of this material. <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> The data should add to our previous structural analysis <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> and distinguish Bi from Te atoms in the structure. However, unexpected problems arised during the experiment: The energy resolution of the detecting system (consisting of a spherical analyzer crystal and a 2D XPAD area detector) could not discriminate the fluorescence line of Mn (5.899 keV) from the second harmonic of the elastically scattered x-rays (13.422 keV +/-300 eV incident energy), owing to the special method-related constraints of setting the distance of the parts of the detecting system from the sample.</p><p>Despite the initial problems, we still succeeded to perform a RXFH experiment on a different sample. This sample was a quasi-crystal of Al 73 Ni 12 Co 15 , which is an even more complex system, and the element-selective information accessible from RXFH are highly in demand. The aim is to separate contributions of the transition metal elements (Ni and Co) to examine if differences can be found in the nominally equivalent sites of the two elements. In this experiment, the Co Kα fluorescent x-rays were recorded while setting the incident energy close to the Ni K-absorption edge at [Ni K]-333eV, -16eV, 0eV and +26eV, respectively. These energies correspond to characteristic relationship in the anomalous parts of the atomic form factors as illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>The corresponding reconstruction in real space is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, in comparison with the 'standard' XFH reconstruction. The atomic images are located at the same sites as in the standard method, but the pure Ni sites are highly emphasized in the resonant approach. These results allow for the quantification of the relative occupations of the different transition metal atoms, which would be extremely challenging by alternative techniques.
