<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is now generally recognized that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) provides precise information about the electronic properties of rare-earth mixed valent systems [1][2]. By tuning the incident energy to salient features of the absorption edges, the various valence states can be resonantly enhanced. This enables an accurate determination of the spectral weight corresponding to each valent character, thus providing a precise estimate of the number of f electrons involved. Among the mixed valent systems, Ce is of particular interest because of the hybridization between the 4f and the conduction band, which is about one order of magnitude larger than that encountered in other mixed valent rare-earth compounds. In a previous experiment (see exp. Report HE-1127), we applied RIXS to follow the γ → α transition in pure Ce under pressure. However, despite cautious sample handling, Ce oxidation could not be avoided in the pressure cell. This problem, related to the difficulty of protecting micrometer-sized samples from oxidation, was circumvented in the present experiment by using chemical pressure through doping of Ce. As reported in Ref.</p><p>[3] for instance, the γ → α transition can be mimicked in the Ce-Th alloys through temperature change.</p><p>In this system, the γ → α transition takes place at ≈100 K an easy temperature range to work with.</p><p>Here, we report on the investigation of the γ → α transition by studying the temperature dependence of Ce 2p3d RIXS signals in a variety of Sc and Th-doped Ce alloys, namely Ce 0.9 Th 0.1 , Ce 0.8 Th 0.2 and Ce 0.93 Sc 0.7 The experiment was carried out at ID-12. Polycrystalline samples were mounted on a cold head installed under vacuum in the UHV-compatible RIXS spectrometer after a thorough cleaning of their surface ex-situ. No oxidation of the samples was observed during the experiment. The RIXS spectra were obtained at the Ce-L 2,3 edge on our bent-crystal spectrometer fitted with a quartz (20-23) crystal. The overall resolving power at 4.8 keV was about 0.8 eV.</p><p>The evolution of the Ce 2p3d RIXS spectra in Ce 0.93 Sc 0.7 as a function of temperature, i.e., as the system goes through the magnetic transition, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The selected spectra were measured at fixed incident</p></div>

The RIXS spectra are normalized to the maximum of the main line intensity (Lα 1 at ∼4833 eV). In addition to the main line which corresponds to 4f 1 component, a shoulder appears on the high emitted energy side; it can be attributed to the 4f 2 component, known to contain most of the information on the hybridization strength. The temperature-dependence of the shoulder intensity is presented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. A similar analysis was carried out in the Ce-Th alloys. In Ce 0.93 Sc 0.7 , the temperature cycle presents a large hysteresis, comparable to what is observed in the thermoelectric power and magnetization measurements. The width of the hysteresis loop is found to shrink as the concentration of alloyed component increases (going from left to right in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). This sensitivity of RIXS spectra to the f valence when the energy is tuned below the white line arises from the fact that the pre-edge region is usually ascribed to quadrupolar transitions (2p → 4f) whereas the white line itself is predominantly of dipolar character (2p → 5d transitions). It is valuable to note that the valence changes would have been barely visible in XAS because of the deep core-hole lifetime broadening effect. This effect is suppressed to a large extend in the RIXS process because it is characterized by a shallow corehole in the final state. The spectra will be further analyzed in a first step within the phenomenological approach detailed in Ref. 2. Although oversimplified, this approach should provide important hints about the valence changes and the hybridization strength in doped systems and possibly unveil the mechanisms responsible for the γ→ α transition in Ce. Multiplet calculations are also envisaged in a near future.

The spectra were normalized to the maximum. The evolution of the high energy shoulder denotes the changes in population of the f 2 final state as the temperature is cycled through the magnetic transition.</p><p>[1] C. <ref type="bibr">Dallera et al., Phys Rev Lett. 88,196403 (2002)</ref>.</p><p>[2] L. <ref type="bibr">Journel et al., Phys Rev B 66, 045106 (2002)</ref>.</p><p>[3] C. <ref type="bibr">Fierz et al., J.
