<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNA polymerase of the infectious bursal disease virus (JR Castón/Jose Fdez-Palacios)</head><p>Session Date Micrographs Ptcls Fractions Å/px Images/hole MX2443 25-27/11/2022 21341 60 0.84 MX2443 22-24/03/2023</p><p>On the 25 th of November of 2023 to the 27 th , we utilized the cryo-electron microscopy services at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) to examine our protein of interest (the RNA polymerase of the infectious bursal disease virus).</p><p>Our local contact at the facility was Traore Daouda. The facility provided excellent services, meeting all of our needs in a timely and professional manner. The facility staff were knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire process. Communication with our local contact was fluent. We held a brief meeting to discuss the details of the acquisition and he frequently reported the status of the acquisition during the session. He also provided us with clear instructions about how to transfer the data to our machines. Finally, we found the data processing services at the facility very convenient. Our samples also returned correctly to our laboratory.</p><p>As for the details regarding the data acquisition and processing, our sample was vitrified in UltrAufoil R0.6/1 grids and 21341 movies were recorded at a pixel size of 0.84. After motion correction and CTF estimation, micrographs (16195) that displayed a better than 3.5 A resolution were selected (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Due to the high number of particles in each micrograph, they were divided into 5 subsets of 3239 micrographs.</p><p>From 150 micrographs, 252,270 particles were reference-free picked using the general model from crYOLO, extracted with a box size of 256 px and binned to 64 px. After two rounds of 2D classification, 67,258 particles were selected and subjected to ab initio reconstruction in CryoSPARC. The best model was refined to 3.4 A using the non uniform refinement job from CryoSPARC with the unbinned particles.</p><p>A set of 100 projections was generated from the resulting model (low-pass filtered to 20 A), which were used for particle picking with Gautomatch. Approximately, 6.1 million particles were picked for each subset, which were processed independently. Resulting picks were extracted using a box of 256 px, binned to 64 px and subjected to two rounds of 2D classification using CryoSPARC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Resulting particles (1.9 million) were then subjected to one round of ab initio reconstruction and heterogeneous refinement using 6 volumes. Particles that belonged to the best two classes were selected (1.1 million)</p><p>and used for a non uniform refinement job using the best ab initio model as reference. A map of 2.7 A resolution was obtained.</p><p>The same processing pipeline was applied to another subset of 3239 micrographs.</p><p>Particles resulting from the heterogeneus refinement job were merged with the ones obtained from the previous subset (2.2 million total) and used for a non uniform refinement job. However, the resulting map stayed at 2.7 A resolution (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Efforts to improve these maps are still ongoing.   MX2446 -Structure of AMPA receptor in the open conformation (Beatriz Herguedas-Francés)</p><p>Session Date Micrographs Ptcls Fractions Å/px Images/hole MX2443 19-21/09/2022 MX2443 3-5/07/2023 In the last year we collected data twice (CM01 19/09/22 and CM01 03/07/23). Our aim was to trap specific AMPA receptor complexes in open conformations. In the first session, we obtained good quality 2Ds but most of the receptor was in a desensitized conformation (2D averages, panel A). Session 2 resulted in excellent quality data (2D averages, panel B), with a preliminary map at 3 Å resolution and the receptor trapped in an open conformation (panel C) MX2443 -Structure the marine giant virus PkV-RF02 (Carmen San Martín/Sara Otaegi) Session Date Micrographs Ptcls Fractions Å/px Images/hole MX2443 20-22/06/2023 16171 24 1.35 1 17-19/4/2023</p><p>We collected a dataset of 16171 micrographs of a giant virus around 180 nm in diameter. It was the first cryo-data collection of this specimen.We encountered a problem with the EPU software at data-collection: the software failed in the identification of holes in the Quantifoil film, with a large number of positions placed on the carbon instead. We did trials with different hole patterns size (R1.2/1.3 and R0.6/1) and the problem persisted in all of them. We attributed the problem to the sample characteristics: dark electrodense thick viral particles distributed in the holes as well as in the carbon, producing similar electrodensity on the hole and carbon film. Additionally, as EPU was not recognizing the physical holes well, the threshold for empty/full ice holes didn´t work as well. An attempt to use SerialEM instead of EPU did not improve the situation. Nevertheless, we managed to collect over 16000 movies, although some hundreds were taken on the carbon (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1A</ref>) and some other hundreds without sample. We thank Gregory Effantin for his help with these complicated grids. For computational analyses, we are using Scipion v3.2.11 to easily combine different software suites in the analysis workflows of cryo-EM data. Movie frames, 24 frames for each movie, were aligned using MotionCor2. The contrast transfer function (CTF) of the micrographs was estimated using CTFFIND4. Based on best defocus values and resolution (rejected the micrographs with around 1.1 defocus ratio and &gt;7 resolution value), 16045 movies were considered to be of good quality.</p><p>At present, particles are being picked manually using XMIPP, as autopicking by either XMIPP or GAUTOMATCH produced suboptimal results. In the movies collected, we can observe viral particles in different states of assembly/disassembly: full (gen ome-containing), empty, and partially filled particles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1B</ref>). Due to the large particle size, on average we expect to have 1 usable particle per micrograph, even after using a moderate magnification (1.35 Å/px).</p><p>With this data collection, we hope to have enough particles to obtain at least a medium resolution first 3D map of the virus, to determine whether on the whole the capsid is icosahedrally ordered, determine its triangulation number, and start modelling the major capsid protein. Unused grids were stored at ESRF (Cane K5, puck 2, name of the puck: ESRF-03, positions 3 and 4) for future, additional data collection.</p></div>

Ni-NTA affinity purified S with 6xHis-tag was mixed with the Nb (1:1.5 molar ratio of S monomer:Nb) during 30 min at 10°C, and the S-Nb complex purified by size exclusion chromatography in a Superose 6 (16/60) column with 20 mM Tris-buffer and 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.7. The sample was concentrated to 1mg/ml and applied to glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil, Au 300 mesh, R 0.6/1). The grids were blotted and then plunged into Data acquisitions for THNΔ35(DA) and THS40p were performed at the Diamond Light Source (DLS) electron Bio-Imaging Centre (eBIC) using a Titan Krios electron microscope operated at 300 kV, equipped with a Gatan Quantum K3 detector operated in counting mode with 0.5Xbinning (super-resolution mode). A total of 9241 and 13213 movies were acquired for THΔ35(DA) and THS40p respectively, at a nominal magnification of 81,000× with a defocus range of -1.6 to -3.4 μm. Movies were fractionated to 40 frames with a total exposure of 2 s for both samples. The electron dose was 30 e-/Å2 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). Motioncorrected movies were extracted and binned 2 to the physical pixel size of 1.07 Å/pixel. Image processing of THΔ35(DA) samples was performed following a similar workflow. All programs used to obtain the different 3D models are implemented in the Scipion 2.0 software platform. First, the beam-induced motion of the movies was corrected using the MotionCorr2 software. After movies alignment, the contrast transfer function (CTF) was calculated and corrected by Gctf. Particles were automatically picked with Xmipp3 -auto-picking software.</p><p>To save computational time during the first processing steps and to increase the signal to noise ratio, particles were downsampled by a factor of 4, and extracted with Xmipp3 -extract particle. The extracted particles were subjected to a first 2D classification using Relion 2.0 and the best classes were subjected to several further rounds of 2D classification, allowing a much better detection of bad particles such as aggregates or particles that were very close to each other. and THS40p, image processing was performed following similar steps and using Relion-377 and cryoSPARC78. The 3D reconstruction process was carried out with D2 symmetry imposition. After several rounds of 2D and 3D classification, 152,128 and 148,453 particles were re-extracted at the original pixel size and used to generate the final 3D maps at 4.6 and</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Å resolution, respectively</head><p>For 3D reconstruction, different de novo initial models were obtained using both EMAN272 and RANSAC73. Another initial model was obtained by low resolution (60 Å) filtering of the atomic structure of the CD of the human TH (PDB 2XSN). The first rounds of 3D classification were performed using Relion 2.0 without any symmetry imposition and using the different initial models. No significant differences were found among the best class obtained from the low-pass filtered atomic structure and the de novo initial model. Particles belonging to that class were subjected to refinement using Relion 2.0-3D auto-refine software. Since clear symmetric features were observed in this class, we sought to determine whether C2 or D2 symmetry was applicable and could contribute to better define our 3D models. The final resolution was 4.7 Å. ESRF BAG report The Iberian cryo-EM Community BAG states were refined, yielding resolutions of 4.5 and 6.6 Å for native I and II states, respectively. (d) The C2 symmetry of the native, semi-activated I plus II and activated states was expanded and the particles from each state were subjected to additional 3D classification without alignment. Classes representing equivalent conformational states (percentages relative to the parental state are indicated) were pooled, resulting in 3D reconstructions of four new intermediate transient states. closed vault map and 7539 particles were selected to calculate the half vault map. The initial model for Class3D was generated from a previous atomic model (PDB: 4HL8) of rat vault low-filtered to 60 Å resolution to eliminate the risk of model bias. In the closed vault reconstruction, particles were subjected to consecutive Class3D and Refine3D jobs and additionally to CTF refinement and particle polishing. This class was refined separately with RELION by applying D39 symmetry. To enhance the signal, a mask was generated around the whole vault, obtaining a map after RELION postprocessing of 3.7 Å. The resolution was determined based on a "gold standard" FSC coefficient of 0.143.</p><p>A model of the vault particle (PDB ID: 4HL8) was docked into the map using UCSF Chimera, and Coot was used to manually adjust these initial models. An initial round of refinement was performed in Phenix using real-space refinement.</p><p>In the case of the half vault, Class3D analysis allowed to calculate a map that presented a reasonable resolution (around 14 Å). This half vault class was refined separately with RELION by applying C1 symmetry. To enhance the signal, a mask was generated around the whole half vault, obtaining a map after RELION postprocessing of 9.3 Å. The resolution was determined based on a gold standard FSC coefficient of 0.143.</p><p>The vault in committed conformation was obtained by the data analysis of the second dataset. A total of 207,815 particles were automatically picked using RELION (21) with a 700 × 700 pixels box. All picked particles were classified using RELION in a 2D classification process (Class2D). A total of 11,666 particles were selected for further 3D classifications (Class3D) that yielded the vault reconstruction in committed conformation.</p><p>This class was refined separately without imposing any symmetrical condition, obtaining a map of 7.9 Å.

Data were chequed at a FEI Talos Arctica electron microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Falcon III electron detector at the Centro Nacional de Bitecnología (CSIC). Selected grids were sent to Grenoble and a dataset was collected in a Titan Krios instrument at the ESRF CM01 line. At the Talos Arctica, the images were recorded at a defocus range of -1 μm to -2.5 μm with a pixel size of 0.855 Å; exposure time was 40 s, with a total exposure dose of 32 e/Å2 over 60 frames. At the Titan Krios, a super resolution acquisition mode was used with a 105k magnification and a pixel size of 0.84 Å, with a defocus range of -1.0 to -2.4 um in 0.2 um step; the exposure time was of 1.8 s, with a total exposure dose of 39.0 e/Å2 (15.3 e/pixel/s) over 40 frames.Particle reconstructions were carried out throughout INSTRUCT projects in the ElectronMicroscopy Image Processing, I2PC, Madrid, which resulted in EM maps of the trimeric S with the bound Nbs. We used Scipion 2.0 (53) in order to easily combine different software suites in the analysis workflows of CryoEM data: Movie frames were aligned using MotionCor2; the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the micrographs was estimated using CTFFIND4; particles were automatically selected from the micrographs using autopicking from Gautomatch. Evaluation of the quality of particles and selection after 2D classifications, the initial volume for 3D image processing, the 3D-classification and the final refinement were calculated using cryoSparc, whereas the sharpening was estimated by DeepEMhancer.Model building for the S-Nb complexes was performed with a S protein structure (PDB 6ZXN) and Nb models, which were prepared with the program Modeller based on the 1ZV5 (1.10), 3TPK (1.29) and 6DBA (2.15) structures. The S structure and the Nb models were fitted into the EM map with the chimera and coot programs. Subsequently, the structures were subjected to real-space refinement in PHENIX (54), which included cycles of rigid body, global and adp minimization. NCS was applied among the S domains, but excluding the RBDs. Nb-RBD binding interfaces were determined with the PISA server, and main figures of the structures were prepared with pymol (pymol.org).

We determined the molecular mechanism of this function through cryo-EM structures, which revealed that the hα2M subunits are organized in two flexible modules that undergo independent expanded-to-compact transitions.</p><p>Sample preparation and data acquisition.</p><p>Wild-type authentic native (hα2M)4 was isolated from thawed frozen plasma from healthy human donors, which was de-identified prior to use in this study. The protein was purified, assessed for peptidase-inhibition competence as described (15, 26, 49), and verified to be equivalent to protein purified from fresh plasma in functional and physiological assays.</p><p>Aliquots of pure protein (5 μL) were diluted to 0.1 mg/mL, applied to R2/2 300 mesh acetone vapor-treated copper grids, and vitrified using a Leica EM CPC cryofixation unit. Data were collected on FEI Titan Krios electron microscopes operated at 300 kV, and images were recorded with Gatan K3-summit cameras in counting mode using the EPU Automated Data Acquisition Software for Single Particle Analysis (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p><p>Image Processing.</p><p>Movies were drift-corrected and dose-weighted with Motioncor2, and contrast transfer function values were estimated with CTFFIND4.1. All subsequent image processing was with The structures obtained with the data acquired in these sessions were published in the reference:</p><p>Guerra P, González-Alamos M, Llauró A, Casañas A, Querol-Audí J, de Pablo PJ, Verdaguer N. Symmetry disruption commits vault particles to disassembly. Sci Adv. Vaults are ubiquitous ribonucleoprotein particles involved in a diversity of cellular processes, with promising applications as nanodevices for delivery of multiple cargos.</p><p>The vault shell is assembled by the symmetrical association of multiple copies of the major vault protein that, initially, generates half vaults. The pairwise, anti-parallel association of two half vaults produces whole vaults. Here, using a combination of vault recombinant reconstitution and structural techniques, we characterized the molecular determinants for the vault opening process.</p><p>Cryo-EM and data acquisition.</p><p>For cryo-EM, an aliquot of 3 μl of recombinant vault sample was applied during 15 s to each EM grid with holey gold film. After that, the grid was blotted with Vitrobot (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) in 100% humidity for 3 s and then plunged into liquid ethane to vitrify the sample. Movies were obtained in Titan Krios 300-kV EM (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) equipped with a Gatan K3 direct electron detection camera at ×81,000. The pixel size was measured to 1.78 Å on the specimen scale. We used an electron dose rate of 8 electrons per pixel per second, and each movie contains 30 frames recorded in 12 s. Image stacks in each movie were aligned with MotionCor2 (28).</p><p>The 30 frames in each stack were averaged to obtain a dose weight of 30 e -/ A 2 . The whole dataset has 3407 movies.
