<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The effect of shear on the orientation of cubic micellar phases formed by a poly(oxyethylene)-poly(oxybutylene) diblock copolymer in aqueous solution has been investigated using small-angle x-ray scattering and small-angle neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS). SAXS was performed on samples oriented in a Couette cell using steady shear, and SANS was performed at Rise National Laboratory, Denmark on samples subject to oscillatory shear in situ in a rheometer with a shear sandwich configuration. A body-centred cubic phase observed for gels with concentrations greater than 30 wt% copolymer was found to orient into a polydomain structure, with the close-packed { 110) planes both parallel and perpendicular to the shear plane. For gels with 30 wt% copolymer or less, an fee phase was observed, and this was also observed on heating the more concentrated gels that formed a bee phase at room temperature. The fee phase could be oriented to form a highly twinned structure, with a significant deviation from the ABCABC . . . stacking sequence of the ideal structure due to the random</p></div>

For the lower concentration gels, a transition from hard to soft gel on increasing temperature was found to be characterized by a change in the susceptibility of the sample to macroscopic shear orientation, as probed using SAXS. The hard gel could be oriented by shear into a twinned fee structure, whereas the soft gel comprised an fee phase with a small grain size, which could not be sheared to form a macroscopically oriented domain. Shear only homogenized the sample, producing a powder SAXS pattern from an fee structure. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Publications I.W.Hamley, J.A.Pople and O.Diat.
