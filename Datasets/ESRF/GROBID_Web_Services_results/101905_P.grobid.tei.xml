<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The grids were previously screened on a Glacios microscope equipped with a 200 kV FEG, an autoloader and a K2-summit direct electron detector. A small dataset was then collected on one grid (~1,000 images) and processed with RELION, leading to a 3.9 Å structure of the CarH complex. A similar grid from the same freezing session with the same protein batch was selected for the high-end data collecUon on CM01 Titan Krios with Quantum-K3 camera (plus the grid already collected on the Glacios as a back-up). The automated data collecUon was set up on the first grid with EPU: suitable squares were selected, an acquisiUon pa\ern with 3 shots per hole was set up with AFIS acUvated to minimise stage movement and speed up the data collecUon. The EPU run went very smoothly without any issues and 39,932 movies could be collected over the 48 hours allocated slot. A`er transfer of the data on a HPC cluster, processing of the data with RELION was performed: ~7.5 millions parUcles were iniUally extracted (~190 parUcles per micrographs) and submi\ed to several rounds of 2D and 3D classificaUon, allowing the selecUon of a very small subset of 98,311 parUcles of high homogeneity with high-resoluUon features. A`er further CTF refinement and parUcle polishing rounds, a 2.4 Å 3D map was obtained, allowing to build unambiguously an atomic model of the complex. These results are part of a wider study and will be incorporated in a publicaUon in the coming months.</p></div>
