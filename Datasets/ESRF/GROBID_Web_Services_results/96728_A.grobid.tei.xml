<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard</head><p>We have noted that the modification of USY with Ti and Zr promotes classical reactions catalyzed by Brønsted acid sites, such as n-hexane cracking and o-xylene isomerization reactions, increasing their reaction rates by 25 and 50% respectively, compared to the undoped USY counterpart. Although more active, the Ti,Zr-USY the early stage of the o-xylene isomerization reaction, unlike the pristine USY catalyst. The aim of the study is to establish the relationship between the local structural order around metals, the resulting acidic properties (Bronsted and Lewis site), and the catalytic performances. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy operated at Zr and Ti K-edge is applied to unravel the structural order around those atoms during o-xylene isomerization (T = 350 ºC, P(oxylene)= 0.05 bar).</p></div>

The experiment was performed at the Ti and Zr K-edges (4.9 and 17.9 keV respectively).

Afterwards, the sample was heated up to 300 °C (10 °C/min) under 100 mL/min of He. At 300 °C, a flow of 100 mL/min H2 was introduced in the reactor. After this, the reaction mixture containing o-xylene and H2 was flowed in the cell for few hours. Finally the cell was purged using 100 mL of He and cooled down. XAS characterization was performed in each step of the test Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref> shows the Zr K-edge XANES spectra of the TiZr USY-40 catalyst under different conditions. It can be observed that the main changes occurred upon water desorption, i.e. after heating at 300 °C under He. After this, no major changes can be observed indicating the stability of the catalyst. Further qualitative analysis regarding the EXAFS oscillations (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>) of the sample and the references confirms that the major changes occurs after the dehydration of the catalysts. After this, there is a stable Zr coordination at the different stages of the test. 17950 18000 18050 18100 18150 Normalized absorption [a.u] Energy [eV] Zr(C 5 H 11 ) 4 TiZr-USY-40 300 °C He ZrO 2 Na 2 ZrSi 4 O 11 ZrSiO 4 Zr(SO 4 ) 2 • 2H 2 O ZrC 4 ZrO 6 Coordination ZrO 7 ZrO 8 ZrO 8 Figure 9 Zr K-edge XANES spectra of the TiZr USY-40 and different Zr references -Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.): -</p><p>Due to the COVID situation, the allocated shifts for this experiment were decreased from 18 to 12. Futhermore, the run also suffered from several and long beam downtime which had an impact on the final scope of the work. Despite those difficulties, most of the structural information required to conclude the study could be recorded except for the state of titanium during o-xylene isomerisation.
