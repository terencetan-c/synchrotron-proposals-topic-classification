<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The scientific committee allowed 18 shifts for the proposal HE1237 entitled "Unravelling the Half Metallic Ferromagnetism of Metal/Oxide Epitaxial Interfaces". The SR-XPS measurements concerning the NiMnSb/MgO and the Fe/MgO interfaces have been performed (see experimental report 1237).</p><p>Because of the ESRF breakdown on the 11 th and 12 th of May 2002, we did not measure the bare Fe 3 O 4 (111) layer and the Fe 3 O 4 (111)/Al 2 O 3 (111) interface.</p><p>Recently (July 2003), ID08 team granted us 6 shifts of "in house" time to compensate the shifts lost due to the ESRF breakdown. This report (HE1237bis) accounts for the SR-XPS and XMCD measurements done during this period.</p><p>Two 25 nm-thick Fe 3 O 4 (111) layers were studied: one exhibiting a free surface and the another one covered with a thin layer of Al 2 O 3 (3nm) epitaxially grown on it.

Besides, the remanence ratio (M R VSM /M S VSM ) is 57% for the bare layer and 41% for the Fe 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 bilayer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b. SR-XPS experiments</head><p>The procedure to restore the surface cleanliness after the passage through air of the bare Fe 3 O 4 (111) layer consists in an annealing in situ at 800 K (P O2 = 10 -6 Torr). We didn't have time enough to fully complete this essential step, and the SR-XPS experiments were thus carried out on a surface that was not completely carbon free (as probed by XPS). The SR-XPS spectrum shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.a shows a negative polarization at the Fermi level in agreement with precedent published work <ref type="bibr">[1][2][3]</ref>. The acquisition time was roughly 8 hours and the energy resolution 0.5 eV.</p><p>No cleaning procedure was applied to the Fe 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 sample. The topmost layers of Fe 3 O 4 are protected by the Al 2 O 3 barrier. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>.b show a SR-XPS spectrum of this sample, recorded during 8 hours with an energy resolution of 0.5 eV. Due to the thickness of the Al 2 O 3 layer (3nm) and the residual carbon contamination, the spin resolved signal coming from the upmost layers of Fe 3 O 4 is rather weak. However, experimental report 1237 demonstrates the feasibility of this kind of measurements (spin polarisation of the occupied states near the Fermi energy through an insulating barrier) for the Fe/MgO interface, and so does the spectrum of figure 2.b for the Fe 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 interface. Unfortunately, the low statistics doesn't allow to draw up more precise conclusions than an almost certainly negative polarization. The acquisition time should be highly increased in this case in future SR-XPS experiments. <ref type="table">0</ref>,<ref type="table">0   2</ref>,<ref type="table">0x10 4   4</ref>,<ref type="table">0x10 4   6</ref>,<ref type="table">0x10 4   8</ref>,<ref type="table">0x10 4   1</ref>,<ref type="table">0x10</ref>  In the experimental set-up, a coil applies a magnetic pulse in order to magnetize the samples, but the SR-XPS acquisition takes place with the magnetic field switched off (electron detection). The value of the SP at the Fermi level shown in figures 2.a and 2.b must be corrected by the value of the M R /M S ratio. As we explain below in this report, the knowledge of the exact value of this correction is essential.</p><p>During the july 2003 experiments, we realised that the pulsed magnetic field applied during the SP measurements is not sufficient to saturate typical Fe 3 O 4 layers.</p><p>Using a VSM in our laboratory, we made a careful estimation of the pulsed field actually applied in the ID08 XPS endstation. In figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, an IRM (Initial Remanence Magnetization) curve of the 25 nm Fe 3 O 4 bare layer is shown. It represents the magnetic moment at remanence (H= 0) as a function of the magnetic field applied to the sample before switching off the field. The value of the remanent magnetization of thes samples after the pulse is given by the horizontal line.</p><p>This comparison permits us to estimate the pulsed field applied just before SR-XPS measurements at the ESRF to be about 500-600 Oe. c. XMCD experiments</p><p>XMCD experiments have also been performed using the High Field Magnet XMCD endstation at ID08. On the one hand XMCD allowed us to study the local magnetic moment of the Fe cations in our layers. On the other hand, they gave us an additional and independent confirmation of the low value of the magnetic field applied before the SR-XPS experiments.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> summarizes our XMCD results.</p><p>-2,0 The features of both the XAS and the XMCD of the Fe 3 O 4 layer measured with an applied field of 65 kOe (figures 4.a and b) are typical of standard magnetite [4,5], whereas those of the Fe 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 interface (figures 4.c and d) are quite different. A comparison of the normalized XMCD signals (with and without barrier) is shown in figure 4.b.</p><p>In particular, the ratio between the XMCD negative peaks related to the Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ cations in octahedral sites is altered with respect to standard magnetite. Fe 2p-XPS measurements performed in our laboratory with a standard X source (not shown here) are consistent with an increased number of the Fe 2+ cations at the Fe 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 interface. In conclusion, the magnitude of the pulse is not sufficient in two ways: the reliability and precision of the final value of the spin polarisation is compromised since the correction due to the M R /M S ratio becomes too large. The field is also lower than the value required to close the major hysteresis loop. Hence the subsequent field reversals performed during the measurement (about 15 per shift) produce a decreasing net magnetization as monitored by XMCD measurements (not shown here). As a consequence the samples were not appropriately magnetized before the SR-XPS measurements. We particularly emphasize this point since knowing remanence exactly is critical for obtaining the accurate spin polarisarion rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and outlook of this work</head><p>The XMCD and VSM results strongly indicate that the magnetic and electronic properties of a Fe 3 O 4 layer are affected by the presence of the Al 2 O 3 barrier. The measurement of the spin polarization at the Fermi level of the Fe 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 interface appears as the key experiment in order to investigate this point. We have demonstrated the possibility to measure the spin polarisation of the occupied states near the Fermi energy through an insulating barrier, an information which is of crucial importance for the understanding and improvement of MTJ devices.</p><p>The results reported here are highly encouraging. Nevertheless, accurate SR-XPS experiments at Fe 3 O 4 /Al 2 O 3 will be possible if a number of experimental conditions are improved.</p><p>1-The magnetic pulse before the SR-XPS acquisition should be enhanced. We need that the coil supplies at least 1.5-2 kOe in order to saturate magnetite-based samples properly. This action is compulsory to succeed in the future SR-XPS experiments. A new set up is planned by ID08 to solve this problem.</p><p>2-SR-XPS measurements have to be recorded with better energy resolution and counting rate. The 100% spin polarization has been predicted by band structure calculations at the Fermi level. The extension in energy of the negative full spin polarization is not given by the calculations. At room temperature, the natural width of the Fermi level is about 40 meV. Using a resolution of 500 meV, we average a rather extended region above the Fermi level. If the spin polarization is lower or if it becomes positive in an energy range inside the energy resolution, the spin polarization measured will be always inferior to that at the Fermi level itself.</p><p>[1]Morton et al. <ref type="bibr">Surf.
