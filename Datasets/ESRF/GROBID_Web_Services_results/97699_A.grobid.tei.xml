<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the present experiment was to investigate if this interaction between metals and proteins of the cytoskeleton could also exist for other cell types and could play a major role in the processes of cell differentiation and division. Our project aimed to investigate the interaction of metals with cytoskeleton proteins, for two cellular models. First, we selected COS-1 african green monkey kidney cells as a model of study because of the known organization of the cytoskeleton structure into easily identifiable microtubules and F-actin fibers. Second, in rat primary astrocytes because they express a different isoform of actin (α) vs neurons (β and γ isoforms).</p><p>Cells were labelled with Silicon-Rhodamine STED fluorofores and both confocal and STED microscopy were peformed on living cells to image tubulin and actin-F. Immediately after confocal and STED microscopy, samples were cryofixed by fast inmersion in cooled ethane (using a FEI vitrobot) and maintained in a cryodewar until analysis. The analyses were carried out on cells maintained in their frozen-hydrated state using the dedicated ID16A cryostation. We used a 17.1 keV X-ray beam focused down to 40 nm with a resulting photon flux of 2.2 10 11 ph/s.</p><p>By confocal microscopy we imaged areas were both proteins showed a clear segregation and we imaged by STED smaller areas at higher spatial resolution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>). Tubulin (red) forms filaments inside the cell, while actin (green) is located at the cellular edges. We imaged by cryo-nano-XRF at ID16A the same cell areas than those imaged by STED. In COS-1 cells, Cu was below the detection limit. Zinc was quite homogeusly distributed in the cell area, not showing evident correlation with cytoskeleton proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In the case of astrocytes, protein compartmentalization is even more pronounced. We can see thick actin fibers spreading throughout the cell, while tubulin is confined to the interior of the cell. Tubulin network consists of numerous fibers, thinner that actin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). In astrocytes, again, we could not evidence a correlation between Zn distribution and F-actin or tubulin. Cu could not be detected either suggesting a higher requirement for Cu in neuronal synaptic compartments compared to astrocytes or COS-1 fibroblasts.</p><p>In conclusion, this experiment benefited from the outstanding capabilities of ID16A beamline in terms of spatial resolution, sensitivity and imaging of frozen-hydrated cells, close to their native state. This experiment enabled to clearly conclude that the expected interaction of Cu and Zn with cytoskeleton proteins, previously described in neuronal synapses, are not observed in COS-1 fibroblats and primary rat astrocytes. This result suggests the involvement of metals in the dynamic phases of cytoskeletal modelling in synaptic compartments that is not found in static phases as observed in cells such as fibroblasts and astrocytes. This a very important information that suggests a specific function for Cu and Zn in the synaptic cytosqueletal plasticity.
