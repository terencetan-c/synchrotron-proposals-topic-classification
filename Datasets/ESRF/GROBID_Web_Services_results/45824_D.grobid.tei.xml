<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>L. Renault: Structural studies of actin self-assembly regulation by multidomain proteins containing intrinsically disordered WH2 repeats</head><p>We study the regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling by multi-domain protein organizations with WH2 domains. WH2 domains are widespread, intrinsically disordered actin-binding peptides (25 to 50 residues) that display significant sequence variability. They are found in many proteins of different organisms as single or repeated (from 2 to 4 repeats) domains. They regulate alone or in synergy with other adjacent domains and other actinbinding proteins different key activities in actin assembly such as actin monomer sequestration, nucleation, or/and unidirectional assembly, and filament barbed end regulation or severing. We study their structure-function relationship in these multi-domain proteins.</p><p>Pathogen bacteria Vibrio cholerae induce cholera, a diarrheal disease. The bacterial multidomain protein VopF from Vibrio cholerae contributes to remodel actin cytoskeleton of the host cell and to the disruption of epithelial integrity and the diarrheal response. It contains an N-terminal localizing domain, a Proline-Rich domain, 3 consecutive WH2 domains which have been recently identified to nucleate pure G-actin <ref type="bibr">(Tam et al., (2007)</ref> Cell Host Microbe 1, 95-107), and an unknown C-terminal domain. We isolated the Cterminal domain and showed that it displays a weak nucleating activity on its own with Gactin-ATP and forms stable dimers. We obtained two crystal forms (small needle-like and cubic crystals) of the C-terminal domain of VopF. The best diffraction we could obtain from these two forms on BM30A on july 2011 was 8 Ã…. The crystal structure of the new dimeric domain from a close homologous protein has been now published by two other groups <ref type="bibr">(Namgoong et al. (2011</ref><ref type="bibr">) Nat Struct Mol Biol. 18, 1060-7;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yu et al. (2011</ref><ref type="bibr">) Nat Struct Mol Biol. 18, 1068-74)</ref>.</p></div>		</body>
