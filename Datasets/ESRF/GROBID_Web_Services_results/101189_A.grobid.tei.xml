<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The current record for the highest critical temperature Tc for a molecule-based magnet is 515 K, held by the network Li0.7[Cr II (pyz)2]Cl0.7•0.25(THF) (1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> ; pyz = pyrazine, THF = tetrahydrofuran). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The material is composed of two-dimensional (2D) layers of Cr II centres and pyrazine ligands in a grid-like arrangement separated by THF, Li + ions, and Cl -ions between the layers, with its magnetic properties stemming from the strong ferrimagnetic exchange between square-planar Cr II centres mediated by bridging pyrazine radicals. An important step in taking these materials outside the laboratory and into real devices is determining whether the bulk properties are maintained at the nano-or single layer scale. It is with this in mind that we sought to prepare similar layered Cr-pyz networks with much larger distances between the 2D layers, as the behaviour of these materials would thus approach what might be expected from an isolated monolayer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> A secondary goal was also to achieve a chemical exfoliation of the layers by prising them apart with larger and larger intercalants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> We thus synthesised analogues to 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> with intercalated Na + , K + , Rb + , and Cs + instead of Li + . The study of these materials, denoted respectively by 2 Na , 3 K , 4 Rb , and 5 Cs , will allow us to determine how the magnetic properties are affected as the distance between the layers is gradually increased. This report concerns a structural and electronic investigation of 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> -5 Cs based on high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (HR-PXRD) measurements at BM01 as well as X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at ID12.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental details</head><p>We note briefly that due to technical issues during the first two days of the ID12 beamtime, we were unable to utilise the better part of these first two days for measurements. These issues were mentioned in further detail in the feedback form our group submitted for this experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Synthesis and structural investigation</head><p>Compounds 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> -5 Cs are synthesised by reducing the 2D network CrCl2(pyz)2 with 2.1 eq. of the appropriate M(Ac) reducing agent (M + = Li + , Na + , K + , Rb + , Cs + ; Ac •-= 1,2-dihydroacenaphthylenide). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> The reaction takes place in THF over 4 days. We note that PXRD measurements on 4 Rb and 5 Cs taken at our home laboratory instrument revealed incredibly poor crystallinity and broad, almost uninterpretable signals, and so these samples were not taken to BM01.</p><p>The room temperature HR-PXRD diffractograms at a detector distance of 200 mm taken at BM01 of 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , 2 Na , 3 K are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (left), with the previously reported indexation of the diffraction pattern of 1 Li indicated (1 Li is indexed in the Pmmm space group, with a = 6.9239(9), b = 6.9524(2), and c = 8.478(2) Å). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Diffractograms were also measured at detector distances of 0 and 500 mm, and it was decided that at 200 mm, the data gave the best balance of a sufficient 2θ range and good resolution. Each of the hk0 peaks in 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> is reproduced in the diffractograms of 2 Na and 3 K . As the Cr-pyz layers in 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> are arranged in the ab-plane, these peaks directly report on the crystallographic order along these layers -hence, we may conclude that 2 Na and 3 K contain Cr-pyz layers similar to those in 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> . However, the peaks relating to the c-axis, that is, those which report on the periodicity perpendicular to the planes, are shifted slightly between 1 Li and 2 Na , and furthermore in 3 K become broadened and much weaker, indicating poor order in this direction for 3 K . The general trend of these peaks from 1 Li to 2 Na to 3 K is towards higher angles, meaning that in fact as the alkali metal ion increases in size, the spacing between the Cr-pyz layers becomes smaller. Further evidence for this puzzling result is presented in the XANES spectroscopy section below.</p><p>The temperature-dependence of the diffractograms of 2 Na and 3 K was also investigated. Data were collected at 120 K to probe for any potential phase changes at low temperature: apart from slight shifts due to thermal contraction, the diffractograms were identical at 120 K and 300 K. For 2 Na , due to the wellresolved nature of the c-axis reflections (see, for example, the 001 reflection in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, right), a variable temperature study was also conducted to probe for the potential loss of THF from between the Cr-pyz layers, as well as for the decomposition of the material at higher temperatures. Similarly to 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , above 380 K the c-axis reflections of 2 Na begin to shift to higher energies as the temperature is increased. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Unlike for 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , however, this shift was also accompanied by a decomposition of the material, as evidenced by a decrease in the overall intensity of the diffractogram. Although this decomposition precludes a thorough analysis of the c-axis shift, we may conclude that as for 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , 2 Na contains THF molecules between the layers which begin to leave above 380 K.</p><p>As a final note, we also attempted to collect single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of 2 Na at BM01, but these efforts were ultimately fruitless as the samples either contained too many crystallites and simply gave diffraction rings, or no diffraction peaks were observed as the crystallite size was too small.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Electronic structure</head><p>To probe the oxidation state and geometry of the Cr centres in 2 Na -5 Cs , Cr K-edge XANES spectra were measured at room temperature at ID12, using the spectrum of 1 Li as a reference. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> These spectra are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The similarity between the profiles of the XANES spectra of 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , 2 Na , and 3 K in both the near-edge and rising edge regions indicates a similar oxidation state and coordination geometry. As we understand the previously characterised 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> to exhibit square-planar Cr II centres, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> we can give the same assignment to 2 Na and 3 K . For 4 Rb and 5 Cs , although the pre-edge features at 5991 and 5994 eV are similarly located to those seen in 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> -3 K , the overall intensity in this region is much weaker, and the position of the rising edge is shifted by around 3 eV higher in energy compared to 1 Li -3 K . While this is consistent with a higher oxidation state for 4 Rb and 5 Cs , most likely Cr III , we cannot discount the possibility of a decomposition of these highly air-sensitive materials, as a similar profile was observed for decomposed samples of 2 Na and 3 K .</p><p>The room temperature Cl K-edge spectra of 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> -5 Cs are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The features in the pre-edge region arise from mixing between the Cl 3p orbitals and 3d orbitals of other atoms. For 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> -3 K , this is only possible between the Cl 3p orbitals and the Cr 3d orbitals, which in turn can only occur for Cl -ions that are intercalated between the Cr-pyz layers. Hence, the intensity of the pre-edge signal gives an indication as to the ratio between intercalated Cl -and extrinsic Cl -. For the previously characterised 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> it is known that Cl - is solely present as intercalated ions, leading to a relatively strong pre-edge signal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Moving to 2 Na , this signal is much weaker, and for 3 K it is barely present, if at all. This indicates that in 2 Na some Cl -is intercalated but most is present as extrinsic NaCl, while for 3 K , practically all of the Cl -is in the form of extrinsic KCl. We note that the NaCl and KCl are formed as byproducts of the reduction of CrCl2(pyz)2 by Na(Ac) and K(Ac) respectively. For 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , the analogous byproduct, LiCl, is soluble in the reaction solvent THF and is therefore washed away. 1 For 4 Rb and 5 Cs , the same conclusions cannot be drawn as for their respective byproducts, RbCl and CsCl, mixing between the Cl 3p and the alkali metal 3d orbitals now becomes possible, as for Rb + and Cs + these orbitals are filled. In these materials, therefore, extrinsic Cl -may also give pre-edge features in the Cl K-edge spectrum. Based on the trend that we observe from 1 Li -3 K , with alkali metal intercalation already becoming difficult with K + , we would expect Rb + and Cs + to be too large to enter between the Cr-pyz layers.</p><p>Therefore, we associate the pre-edge feature in the spectra of 4 Rb and 5 Cs to mixing between the Cl 3p and the alkali metal 3d orbitals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Magnetic properties</head><p>For 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , it has already been determined that its hysteretic behaviour stems from the anisotropy of the square planar Cr II ions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> We sought to verify that this was also true for 2 Na -5 Cs using XMCD measurements at variable field. The XMCD spectra of 2 Na and 3 K are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. Due to the probable decomposition of 4 Rb and 5 Cs that was evidenced by the Cr K-edge XANES spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), the XMCD of these two samples was not measured. The feature marked with α arises from polarisation of the Cr 4p and 3d orbitals by spin-orbit interactions, while the feature marked with β in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) region is associated with multielectron excitations. These features agree well with the previously obtained XMCD spectrum of 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , again confirming the similar local electronic structures of the Cr atoms between 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , 2 Na , and 3 K .</p><p>As the intensity of the XMCD signal is proportional to the magnetisation of the Cr atoms, one can monitor the hysteretic behaviour of the system via the XMCD signal as a function of the field. For both 2 Na and 3 K , the rising edge signal at 6000.7 eV was monitored as a function of the magnetic field from -17 to +17 T. The data for 2 Na is displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, scaled to the previously obtained M vs. H curve of the bulk material. As the XMCD signal originates only from the magnetisation of the Cr centres (the spin-orbit polarisation of the radical pyrazine ligands should be sufficiently low such that they do not contribute to the XMCD signal), the similarity of its field dependence with the field dependence of the magnetisation indicates that the hysteretic properties of the material are dominated by the behaviour of the Cr II centres. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The same behaviour was observed for the field dependence of the XMCD signal at 6000.7 eV of 3 K , confirming that the same interpretation is true for this material as well. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Summary and conclusions</head><p>The overarching goal of this project is to take the network Li0.7[Cr II (pyz)2]Cl0.7•0.25(THF) and increase the distance between the Cr-pyz layers via chemical means, potentially towards exfoliation. A key step towards realising these goals is structural and electronic characterisation of the resulting materials. Through an in-depth HR-PXRD, XANES, and XMCD study at BM01 and ID12, we have achieved a thorough picture of the structural and electronic characteristics of 2 Na -5 Cs .</p><p>Despite the desired goal of increasing the interlayer distance, HR-PXRD indicated that as the alkali metal increased in size, this distance became lower. The Cl K-edge XANES measurements are consistent with the interpretation that as the alkali metal increases in size, less intercalation occurs, therefore resulting in a smaller interlayer distance. As for 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> , this interlayer distance could be modified by application of heat, with THF between the layers leaving above 380 K for 2 Na , as evidenced by a shift to higher angles of the 001 reflection with time and increasing temperature. Where for 1 <ref type="bibr">Li</ref> the material was stable up to 500 K, for 2 Na a decomposition was observed much lower in temperature, with a decrease in intensity of the diffractogram observed from 380 K and above.</p><p>The Cr K-edge XANES measurements confirmed identical Cr oxidation states and coordination environments between 1 Li -3 K , all possessing square-planar Cr II centres. The dominant role of the Cr II centres in the hysteretic behaviour of the compounds was demonstrated by XMCD measurements at varying field. Unfortunately, for 4 Rb and 5 Cs , a probable decomposition of the materials precluded a proper analysis of their electronic structures.</p><p>Overall, the in-depth investigation outlined in the above has given us vital information as to the next steps needed in working towards the goals of this project. New synthetic strategies are required to drive the intercalation of larger alkali metal cations. We have also learnt that the magnetic properties of these materials are not significantly affected by changes in the layer-layer distance, an important knowledge in view of future efforts for rationally designing 2D networks for applications in next-generation devices.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
