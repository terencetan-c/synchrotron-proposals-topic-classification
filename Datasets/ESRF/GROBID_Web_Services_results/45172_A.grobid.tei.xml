A clear dichroic signal is present, with a magnitude equal to ca. 1 % of the edge step. This is with respect to what is found in Au-Fe alloys. Sitting minimum of the dichroism at the L 3 edge, and scanning the field at fixed T, we could magnetisation on gold is largely saturated at 6 T. ample VV130 (Au@FexOy 10 nm Au cores and a compact flower-like 12-14 nm thick FexOy heterodimers individually made of one 7-10 nm Au are shown in Fig. 3. =9 K and in field of 9 T. 1 % of the edge step.

With the remarkable exception of the Au alloy nanoparticles, we found that all the other samples investigated in this experiment, irrespective exactly in the some way of sample VV129: there is no transfer of spin component of the hybrid heterostructure. possible rationalisation of this behaviour could be found by looking at the XAS spectra at This is contrary to what we have found on sample VV129.

This result indicates that, while in sample VV130 some magnetic the remarkable exception of the Au-Fe mples investigated in this experiment, irrespective n the some way of sample VV129: there is no transfer of spin possible rationalisation of this behaviour could be found by looking at the XAS spectra at the Fe-Photon energy (eV) Here we compare the XANES at the Fe-K edge of both samples and of bulk Fe 3 O 4 , used as a reference. We note that the edge position is related to the oxidation state of the photoabsorber, the edge shifting towards lower energies with decreasing oxidation state. It is readily apparent that in the two samples the oxidation state of Fe is different, with the mixed valence oxide Fe 3 O 4 somewhat in between. Similar results have been obtained also for all the other samples, showing no magnetic moment on Au, and an Fe edge energy position almost equal to that of sample VV129.</p><p>In conclusion, in this experiment several samples have been tested, with several different morphologies (flowers, dymers, core-shell, core-hollow shell, etc.). We found a sizeable magnetic moment on Au just in two cases: sample VV130 and nanoparticles of Fe-Au alloy. When a magnetic moment on Au is present, Fe is always in a reduced oxidation state (closer to Fe(II) than to Fe(III) in VV130, metallic in the alloy). On the contrary, the presence of magnetism on Au is independent of morphology. Thus, it appears that magnetism is transferred to Au via an electronic mechanism, that implies an electron transfer from Au to Fe, and the creation of holes in the Au 5d states. A possible speculation is that the contact between the Au and Fe x O y nanocrystals is via an Fe layer, rather than via and oxide layer.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: TEM micrographs showing the experiment.
