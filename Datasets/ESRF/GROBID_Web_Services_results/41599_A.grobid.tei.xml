<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>At the Dept. of Chemistry of the University of Salerno we have prepared and characterized a new crystalline solid based on p-Bu t -calix[4]dihydroquinone 1 revealing the simultaneous existence of water channels and very large hydrophobic cavities (~1000 Å <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies have been carried out on these compounds using synchrotron radiation, since the crystals are small (ca. 0.1 mm size) and intrinsically weakly diffracting. The compound has a cubic structure (a = 36.412(4) Å) with 48 calixarene molecules and 155 water molecules in the unit cell. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> The simultaneous presence of networked channels, filled with easily removable water, and isolated hydrophobic cavities implies potential applications of nanotechnological interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Interestingly, solventinduced polymorphism can be observed. By exposing a capillary containing the crystalline cubic phase powder to vapours of acetonitrile, single crystals had formed in the capillary. The resulting rather small and twinned crystals were analyzed by X-ray diffraction at the SNBL at the ESRF, showing the presence of monoclinic co-crystals of 1 with water and acetonitrile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> This proposal aims to characterize the guest uptake properties of this new material by exposing single crystals to several volatile compounds and to locate the guest molecules inside the channels of the cubic crystalline form. Moreover it has also been investigated the role of guest molecules in promoting the formation of new crystalline forms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental details</head><p>Single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments have been performed at ID11 beam line at low temperatures (using a liquid nitrogen cryostream) and for one sample also at room temperature, using a wavelength of 0.32887 Å and a distance between the sample and the detector of 130 mm. Different exposure times have been used to obtain good quality data both at high and at low angle. Crystallization procedures did not produced single crystals of 1, the selected samples were always constituted by one large crystal surrounded by one or more smaller crystals . Crystalline samples were sealed into Lindemann capillaries previously filled with a drop of organic volatile compound, CHCl 3 , CCl 4 , EtOH, CH 3 OH and CH 3 CN were used. In one case a different approach has been followed: a crystalline sample was soaked in a drop of toluene and then mounted in a cryo-loop. Moreover cubic crystalline powders of 1 were exposed to acetonitrile vapours for 72 hours obtaining very small single crystals, which were fully characterized.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>A total of 15 samples have been analysed, obtaining 6 crystal structures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The above experiments allowed us to elucidate the structural changes upon guest adsorption and to characterize the host-guest interactions. It was possible to evaluate the effect of size and affinity upon guest inclusion. The cubic nanoporous structure is always retained except for the case of acetonitrile for which a new triclinic phase has been obtained, as an example of guest induced pseudopolymorphism.</p></div>		</body>
