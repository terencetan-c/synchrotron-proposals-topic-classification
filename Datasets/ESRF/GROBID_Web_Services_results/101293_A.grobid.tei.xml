<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>After system alignment and explanation on how to operate the system, we started Tuesday afternoon in-situ measurements of Kolbe electrolysis of acetic acid on Pt. For these measurements, we brought an electrochemical cell designed within ESRF suitable for low-incidence angle fluorescence measurements. Unfortunately, the extensive formation of bubbles caused by oxygen, ethane and CO2 evolution disturbed the XAS spectra severely (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for an example) A few attemps were made to minimize to effect of bubble formation, for example by adjusting the applied current density or the pump speed. Unfortunately, the bubbles continued to affect the quality of the XAS spectra. Therefore, we decided to shorten the measurement time of an XAS spectra, so that the chance of a bubble disrupting the spectra was reduced. Still, many of the obtained spectra were of bad quality. So, we decided to continue with a different cell designing prior to the beamtime refered to in the following as the gravity flow cell. This new cell had an electrolyte flow based on gravity flow. We hoped that with this design, the formed bubbles were effectively transported away from the electrode. Unfortunately, this was not the case and we ended up with another set of low quality XAS spectra (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for an example) due to excessive bubble formation.</p><p>Considering the severe limitations caused by bubble evolution, ex situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy was applied to analyze the electronic and structural changes of the platinum oxide layer formed under polarization at high anodic potentials in blank and acetic acid electrolyte. The XAS experiments were performed on thin film (10 or 25 nm) platinized titanium samples (Ti foil, 0.5mm, 99%) produced by sputtering. After polarization of the Pt anode in an ex-situ operated electrochemical cell, the Pt was removed from the electrolyte to measure XANES and EXAFS spectra in fluorescence mode. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> provides a summary of all ex situ measurements performed. In the followign the experimental data refer to measurements performed with 10 nm thcik Pt films only. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the XANES spectra of an unpolarized Pt foil and a PtO2 pellet (references), and the Pt electrodes (10 nm thick Pt films) polarized at 100 mA cm -2 until a charge of 70 C has passed the cell using the blank electrolyte and actual Kolbe conditions, ie acetic acid containing electrolyte, with the corresponding EXAFS data summarized in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. After polarization (in either blank electrolyte or acetic acid electrolyte), clear changes occur in the XANES spectra of the Pt electrode. The location of the adsorption edge increased to higher energy, the white-line has a higher peak intensity and a "dip" occurs in the post-edge region. The stronger white-line intensity and the dip in the post-edge region at high potentials are characteristic spectral features of platinum oxides as also reveleasd by the reference PtO2 data. These changes are more prominent in the blank electrolyte, which implies that the platinum surface after polarization in blank electrolyte is more oxidized compared to polarization in acetic acid electrolyte, confirming the research hypothesis that under Kolbe condition as surface layer is formed inhibiting oxidation of the electrode surface. It should be noted that though already thin film Pt electrodes have been used, the surface sensititvity is still compromised by the surface to bulk Pt ratio.</p><p>In summary, it was not possible to obtain good quality in-situ XAS spectra during Kolbe oxidation of acetic acid due to the extensive formation of bubbles on the Pt electrode during our beamtime. For future in-situ XAS experiments, it is important that a cell is designed which can effectively transport bubbles away from the electrode surface.
