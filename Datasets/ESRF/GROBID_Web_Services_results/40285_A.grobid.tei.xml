<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>These experiments were designed to understandand some unexpected contrasts previously observed at ID19 in white beam section topographs images of surface acoustic waves (SAW) propagating along the YZ direction in lithium niobate resonators. Two different kinds of images were observed respectively with SAW of moderate and of large amplitude using similar diffraction conditions (0,3.0 reflexion, Bragg geometry) that give mostly information about the normal component of the SAW.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a/ Section images of SAW with a moderate amplitude (propagation along YZ in LiNbO 3 ).</head><p>When the collimation slit, used to define a thin X-ray (white) beam, is, as usual, oriented parallel or perpendicular to the acoustic wave front no particular features appear in the section images. However, when the resonator is rotated around its normal, starting with a slit parallel to the surface wave front, unexpected white beam section images of the SAW are obtained that contain multiple contrasts extending far away from the expected width of the section image (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>: rotation # 25°). Five to six successive fringes of the SAW with decreasing intensities are visible. The first one is much larger than the corresponding image of the non-vibrating part of the resonator. Such contrast is not observed in monochromatic images (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Several mechanisms can explain the multiple contrasts appearing in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>One possibility is related to the role of the harmonics of the experimental wavelength (λ=1.25Å for =25°) that can image parts of the SAW situated at depth increasing with the harmonic rank. Another possible explanation can be linked to the multi-trajectories diffraction that can exist in deformed crystals <ref type="bibr">[1][2]</ref>. Such multi-path diffraction was predicted and observed in crystals curved by a constant strain gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It may be extended to the case of a sinusoidal displacement, as in the case of SAW, which gives a somehow similar distribution of strain in several parts along a period.</p><p>The images as well as the rocking curves registered, using a monochromatic radiation ( 20 keV) do not show multiple contrasts nor oscillations in the rocking curves. Similar experiments made with SAW propagating on ST cut quartz have given similar results (figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). This indicates that the contrasts appearing in the white beam images, as those of figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, are most likely due to the harmonics contained in the white beam. In order to formulate a definitive conclusion, simulations are in progress to confirm the experimental results and to gain further insight of the diffraction mechanism involved in the formation of the white beam translation images of surface acoustic waves. The experimental results have been presented and published <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It is planed to publish the results of the comparison between the experimental images and the simulated ones as soon as the simulation program will be ready.</p><p>It should be noticed that the knowledge of the mechanism responsible for the multiple contrasts will allow to get a better understanding of the variations of the amplitude as a function of the depth as it was previously fund by means of simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b/ Observation of the propagation of SAW having a large amplitude.</head><p>The section topographs, obtained with the same diffraction conditions as for the small amplitude and with a much larger excitation voltage, exhibit another kind of contrast whose width is proportionnal to the local amplitude of vibration. The previous multiple contrasts exist also in the section images (figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>When a monochromatic radiation is used these constrasts as well as the multiple ones disapear. A small increase of the width of the rocking curve is observed for the large amplitude SAW indicating that the acceptance of the reflexion increases. The variation of the width of the section image with the amplitude of the SAW is due to a mechanism similar to the one observed for the bulk acoustic wave of large amplitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (see below) which appears when the strains become too large to satisfy the hypothesis of the dynamical theory. Then, a quasi kinematical process due to a too important rotation of the lattice plane, occurs and enlarges the section image as a function of the amplitude of the SAW. This phenomenum can produce a non negligible divergence of the diffracted beam (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>) and explains the influence of the filmsample distance on the shape of the image. This contrast may be explained according to the drawing of figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>: the incoming wave is scattered at different depths inside the resonator. SAW Dislocations Figure 3:Monochromatic image of SAW on ST quartz. The contrasts nearly orthogonal to the SAW wave fronts are due to the dislocations present in this substrate. (20keV, (01.-1) reflexion) . The mechanism is the same as the one already oserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> in the case of bulk waves (figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). The local width of the section topograph becomes proportional to the amplitude of vibration, when the amplitude is sufficiently important; it becomes also proportional to the film-sample distance.</p><p>A first communication was given at the 2009 IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It has been accepted for publication in the proceedings <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>The practical interest of the observations made is quite important since it allows to obtain very simply, a map of the vibration amplitude in SAW devices (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</p><p>Work is in progress to extend the domain of validity of the already known programs for the simulation of X-Ray topographs to simulate these images.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Détailed study of the propagation of high amplitude bulk shear waves.</head><p>Stroboscopic translation topographs have been recorded with a monochromatic wave for highly excited bulk wave quartz resonators. The corresponding rocking curves have also been registered. The aim was to further understand the observations reported in figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> in section topographs. These experiments (E=20Kev, Laue Geometry, (-2,1.0) reflection) show a noticeable enlargment of the rocking curve when the amplitude of the vibration mode is increased to the values where these new contrasts appear.</p><p>These contrasts occur when the vibration amplitudes becomes too large to give rise to the usual dynamical constrasts observed for lower wibration amplitude which can be predicted by simulations made using the equations of the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction. The simulations should be able to better take into account the kinematical part of the contrast. These observations for the bulk wave resonators are of similar nature as those made for large amplitude surface wave (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). They show that the new contrasts observed in both cases have the same origin. However, due to the resonant nature and the high Q of the vibration mode of the bulk wave quartz resonators, a more intense effect can be observed for the bulk waves than for the surface wave devices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary observation of irradiation effect on quartz resonators (white beam and monochromatic beam) and new possibilities offered by the synchrotron radiations.</head><p>The experiments made to study the bulk wave propagation under strong excitation were a good opportunity to study the variations of the resonance frequencies of the quartz samples as a function of the exposure to the white beam or to a monochromatic beam (20 keV). Noticeable frequency shifts occur during these experiments. After an exposure of the order of 10-20 minutes (white beam) the frequency becomes stable, the value being very dependant on the purity and on the perfection of the quartz material used to build the resonator. The starting frequency was always 5680691.Hz, the frequency shift in the range of 8-10Hz for the best material, and of 24-26 Hz for another resonator of high purity. These variations are linked to irradiations defects resulting from the capture, by the impurities or the lattice imperfections, of the electronic carriers generated during x-ray exposure. These irradiations defects have different energies and thermal stabilities. Their destruction leads to carrier recombination and often to luminescence. A very intense luminescence was observed at room temperature for some quartz samples exposed to the white beam.</p><p>The study of this luminescence can be a powerfull method to study the defects creation-anhilation equilibrium at different temperature. Other methods to study the irradiation defects can also be used simultaneously (ESR, etc..). P ↑ Figure 6: Section images of a bulk wave ( thickness shear) resonator with increasing amplitude of vibration. Experiment made at ESRF Beam line ID19 07/2001</p><p>On the whole, the interest in the use of the synchrotron radiations (possibility a large flux in a large energy range) combined with various kinds of spectroscopies, is very probably important to efficiently study many kinds of irradiation defects in various materials.</p><p>A better knowledge of irradiation effects in quartz is presently needed to improve the performances of the high stability oscillators used in space applications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1:White beam section image{ (0,3.0) reflexion, Bragg geometry, diffraction vector normal to the surface, =25° =1.25Å, # 25° around the normal, false color to enhance the visibility of the multiple contrasts.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,40.96,649.51,226.09,77.25" type="bitmap" /></figure>
