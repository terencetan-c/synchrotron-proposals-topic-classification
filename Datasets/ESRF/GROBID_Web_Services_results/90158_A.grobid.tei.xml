<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manufacturing of Laser Metal Deposition(LMD) samples</head><p>Eight samples of varying height (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) were manufactured for the ESRF experiment. An aditional specimen was prepared for d0 measurements as seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Tubes were manufactured using a 4.0 kW Trumpf laser cell which allows control of process parameters, i.e. laser power, focus position, laser scanning speed and bed rotational speed, thus providing a reliable and repeatable process. The LMD are given in the</p><p>Table below: Titanium Grade 5 ASTM (Ti-6Al-4V) powder Power 1900W Powder mass flow rate 8 g/min Traverse Velocity 0.01 m/s Powder Carrier gas Helium Nozzle angle 8° in retreat direction Shielding gas Argon Nozzle standoff 12 mm Powder particle size 40 -100 µm Layer height 0.6 mm Powder particle shape Spherical Laser spot size 3 mm</p><p>The Experiment: After setting up the two energy dispersive detectors, a set of tube specimens were mounted as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and measurements made in both the hoop and axial directions. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows a typical diffraction pattern in the α-phase of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy fitted with GSAS after conversion to virtual angle dispersive diffraction. This allowed access access to additional peak profile functions. The peaks are clearly separated and easy to fit, but as evident in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>, some peaks are missing due to the large grain size. This issue provided the rationale for choosing energy dispersive diffraction measurements. The resultingstrain maps are currently being processed to provide residual stress data that can then be related to specimen height and to the influence of machining. These residual stress maps will eventually be related to the dynamic load performance of LMD Ti-6Al-4V tube components and correlated with the LMD microstructure in an ongoing PhD project. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Inter-relationships Among Build Height, Residual Stresses, Distortion and Properties of Ti-6Al-4V Tubes Manufactured by Laser Metal Deposition (LMD) experiment and scientific background Component distortion is caused by residual stresses which arer a function of build-height. Understanding this relationship allows for prediction of optimium build-height giving minimal distortion of thin walled Ti6Al4V LMD components. The original objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between build height and through-thickness residual stresses. However, to ensure that sufficient data was acquired for each height, measurments were limited to the tube thickness centerline. This still allow quantification of the influences of residual stresses on the dimensional stability of the tube sections. The LMD tubes were manufactured with a 40 mm inner diameter and a wall thickness of 4 mm. Sample height varied from 10 mm (14 layers) to 70 mm (110 layers) and consited of four Series 1 (machined) and four Series 2 (as-built) samples (Figure1).</figDesc></figure>
