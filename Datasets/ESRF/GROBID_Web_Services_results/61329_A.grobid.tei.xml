The data was collected on beamline ID24 using the laser heating system on 4µm thick metal foils fluxed with an atmosphere of He +2%H to prevent excessive oxidation.</p><p>Sample A (Pure Iron) was sourced from Goodfellow. The remaining alloys were created at the University of Warwick and rolled to 4µm by Goodfellow. The composition of the alloys studied are communicated in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p><p>In this experiment we probed the solidifying primary phase during rapid solidification. Each foil was loaded in a simple holder fabricated at ESRF and heated with two YAG (1064 nm) lasers. Measurements were taken at the Fe-K edge (7.1109 keV). Some figures taken from a manuscript being prepared for publication are presented.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows, a) Normalised XAS near the Fe-K edge shown as a function of time for a Fe (Alloy A), b) fitted data depicting the extracted phase fractions during melting and c) during solidification. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows, fitted data depicting the extracted phase fractions for a) Alloy E where the primary solidifcying phase is FCC and b) Alloy D where the primary solidifying phase is BCC. The laser 'pulse' thermal cycle has enabled the exploration of rapid solidification phenomena in-situ. It was found in Fe-C alloys primary BCC solidifcation could be avoided, an investigation exploring solification under contronrolled cooling using programmed laser ramps would be of great interest.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: a) Normalised XAS near the Fe-K edge shown as a function of time for a Fe (Alloy A), b) fittled data depicting the extracted phase fractions during melting and c) during solidification.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,108.72,222.72,378.24,295.20" type="bitmap" /></figure>
