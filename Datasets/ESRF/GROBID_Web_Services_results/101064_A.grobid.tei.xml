<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Combined study of the morphology and composition of historical cobalt green pigment: toward a deeper understanding of the pigment synthesis history and aesthetical value Proposers: POUYET Emeline (emeline.pouyet@upmc.fr), BERRAUD-PACHE Romain (romain.berraudpache@sorbonne-universite.fr ), AUTRAN Pierre-Olivier ( pierre-olivier.autran@esrf.fr )</p><p>Beamtime background summary: The synthesis of cobalt green pigments ((Zn1-x-Cox)O) from the 19 th century remains unstudied. However, it resulted in pigments with various Co/Zn ratios, that ultimately influenced their optical properties. A multi-technique investigation coupling XRF-CT and scanning 3DXRD was established during beamtime HG188 to provide high resolution data on the morphology and composition of seven 19 th century pigment samples, to better understand their synthesis history and its effect on the final optical properties of the pigment particle. More specifically, the enrichment of cobalt inside of the pigment particles can reach very low dimensions or densities, yet have major effect on its visual appearance. Only the high resolution of XRF-CT and s3DXRD make possible to detail the powder heterogeneous composition at the sub-millimetric scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology:</head><p>The first day of experiment has been dedicated to sample preparation and CT measurements (acquired at 43 keV, resolution 1 µm², and flux of 4.10 8 ph/sec). 7 historical, and 1 modern powder samples were mounted on a kapton grid (200 -75 µm in diameter) using a UV activated glue (an example is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> and <ref type="figure">b</ref>). After each scan (20 min/scan) the data were analysed and reconstructed using the beamline inhouse software tomwer, based on the python library Nabu (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> and <ref type="figure">d</ref>). CT data were vizualized using ImageJ. This first step allowed selecting the area of interest for XRF-CT and s3DXRD. First a transmission image was acquired in the CT scan configuration, then when mounted on the 3DXRD branch, the visible image of the aligned sample allowed to define the sample height of interest and proceed with the scan. 1 day was dedicated to troubleshoot XRF-CT, as the Silicon Drift Detector configuration parameters had to be changed.</p><p>Then the first exploitable scans were acquired. Two days were dedicated to this technique, and 11 scans were acquired on both historical and standard samples. All XRF-CT data were reconstructed on site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) and XRF data were further analyzed after beamtime using the PyMca software. The XRD data have not yet been analysed. It appears that these data have only mono-crystal profile. Currently, there is no software available at the beamline to analyse these data. Further development with the team are on the way. Thanks to the XRF results, we can focus on some areas of interest to get their pattern of diffraction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Phase contrast CT: Two types of particule morphology were distinguished among the pigment powders analysed: i) five sample powders present a very fine yet heterogeneous structure, in which we can determine a particule size ranging from 4 µm to 50 µm, and ii) two samples have an aspect of large agglomerate, with a core composed of individual particles surrounded by an homogeneous shell with a slightly higher phase coefficient. These mapping have been extremely useful to define region of interests for XRF-CT and 3sDXRD. XRF-CT: Two main results, correlated with previous CT scans, were observed:</p><p>-two different groups inside the fine powder samples were distinguished: *four historical samples with an homogeneous repartitions of Zn correlated to various ratios of Co (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). This repartition corroborate the µXRF results previously acquired. These four historical pigments are also those with the closest tints (dark green). * one sample with an homogeneous repartition of Zn and a single particle with a sort of cavity of a very high concentration of Co and a low concentration of Zn (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>). This sample presents a blue-green tint. -the large agglomerates provide unexploitable data. Indeed, due to the large size and density of these samples, X-rays are re-absorbed by the sample core. These results highlight the importance of the sample selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The whole set of samples (7 historical pigments) have been analyzed with XRF-CT and s3DXRD. The spatial resolution and sensitivity of the approach allowed the study of the Co/Zn distribution at the particle scale. The XRF results highlight two categories of pigments based on the Co and Zn repartition inside the sample that correlate with their tint. XRD results must bring us more information about the cristallography structure (i.e addition or substitution of cobalt on zinc) within the next months. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): POUYET Emeline*, BERRAUD-PACHE Romain*, MALMERT Aurore*, THILLAYE DU BOULLAY* Affiliations for all co-proposers : Laboratory LAMS UMR8220 LAMS UMR 8220 Sorbonne Université 4 place de Jussieu (Tour 23-33) 3e étage FR -75005 PARIS</figDesc></figure>
