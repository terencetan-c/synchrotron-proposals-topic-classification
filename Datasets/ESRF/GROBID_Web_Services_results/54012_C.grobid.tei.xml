<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment we have investigated the speciation and internal distribution of engineered nanomaterials, and in particular cobalt nanoparticles, within exposed Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) by utilizing the nanotomography and nano-XRF set-up at ID16A.</p><p>Caenorhabditis elegans is a model organism for exposure experiments because it is facile, has a short life cycle and is easy to propagate in large populations. Being transparent, it allows optimal observation of its internal organs. The small size (~0.2 mm x 1 mm), make nematodes ideal specimen for high resolution imaging of entire individuals and their organs</p><p>The nematodes used for this study were exposed to Co nanoparticles in standardized soil pore water for 96 hours and subsequently preserved fixed in paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde and dehydrated using ethanol and hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). Comparison with non exposed individuals was performed as well.</p><p>The experiment has followed the following schedule: first, phase contrast CT and 2D-have been performed on entire individuals and target organs of C. elegans in order to characterize the distribution of Co in the nematodes and relate it with the morphology; in a second phase 3D nano-XRF has been performed on the most relevant areas (indicated by the previous step) in order to prove/disprove effective uptake of Conanoparticle, i.e. presence of univocally identified Co-particles within the inner boundary of target organs.</p><p>The nano-CT and nano-XRF performed on exposed C. elegans yielded unprecedented high quality images showing the inner organs of the nematode and the extent of the Co distribution. Co was univocally proven to be inside the nematode. An example of the images obtained in experiment EV71 is shown in Fig 1 ; an explanatory light microscope picture is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.</p><p>The image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> was created by phase contrast absorption X-ray nanotomographic imaging of a preserved nematode mounted inside a quartz capillary (diameter 0.1 mm) at ID16A Nano Imaging. Beamsize was 20 nm x 37 nm and the X-ray energy 17 keV.</p><p>What we see in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> is two embryos in the uterus of an adult hermaphrodite C. elegans nematode. Behind the embryos we can see abundant Co nanoparticles in the intestine of the nematode. This level of detail can only be obtained at nano-imaging beamlines. The presence of Co was confirmed by X-ray fluorescence tomography performed at the same location. Fig. 2. Light microscope image of a C. elegans individual The results of EV71 have demonstrated the enormous potential for studying the fate of nanoparticles in small model organisms such as C. elegans that can be performed at beamline ID16A-NI. The present results will serve as an important input to nanotoxicology. Moreover, samples have been produced that could be tested in the near future to determine the crystallographic/molecular/oxidation state information pre-andpost-uptake by means of micro XANES and XRD. This study will be fully described in Brede et al. (2015), State-of-the art nanoimaging of Co nanoparticle distribution within exposed Caenorhabditis elegans, in preparation. Moreover, we are proud to report that these results were selected for a Beauty of Science item on ESRF News, July 2015, no. 70.
