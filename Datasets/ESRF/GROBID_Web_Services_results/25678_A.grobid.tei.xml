Tanem Aa.Stori J. Mårdalen R. Mathiesen SINTEF Materials and Chemistry Høgskoleringen 5, N-7465 Trondheim Norway Report:</p><p>We were allocated 9 shifts of 16 bunch mode for in-situ study of the melting-and crystallization of blends of a linear polyethylene (LPE) with selected branched polyethylene (BPE). The blends as well as the blend constituents went through a controlled heating/cooling cycle at ambient pressure with a LINKAM DSC cell combined with time-resolved SAXS/WAXS scattering.</p><p>Alignment of the SAXS/WAXS equipment required 2 shifts. A thunderstorm caused storage ring problems with beam loss at three occasions. At each incident the samples needed to be cooled down to room temperature in a controlled (and slow) manner and the whole pre-determined cycle had to be repeated (in order to ensure a comparable thermal history of the samples).</p><p>In addition, the monochromator vacuum pump was unstable causing beam loss/missing frames during the whole session. All together, we estimate a time loss of 3 shifts due to these problems. In addition, the contact between the PC and WAXS detector were lost at two occasions, forcing us to repeat measurements.</p><p>The remaining time, minus calibration, was used effectively on a highly revised set of samples and highquality time-resolved data were obtained. The time-resolved SAXS/WAXS measurement allowed us to study the co-crystallization process in blends and formation of aggregate structures different from the individual components and to compare this with room-temperature observations on lamellae and spherulites from electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.</p><p>As described in the proposal, previous work on these samples had demonstrated a tendency of the blend components to crystallize into separate crystalline populations, for lower degree of branching in the branched blend component than previously reported. In addition, the role of each component involved in the crystallization process was not clear. The good quality of the time-resolved data obtained in this work, has enabled us to get this information.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the temperature dependence of the degree of crystallinity in a LPE/BPE blend is given. In the blends, the degree of crystallinity begins to increase at a temperature different from-and between those of the individual blend components. This observation together with time-resolved SAXS, DSC and roomtemperature TEM observations suggests the formation of cocrystalls of LPE and this particular BPE.</p><p>0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1 0 25 50 75 100 125 T [ o C] Crystallinity % I LPE II: 50/50 LPE/BPE III: 10/90 LPE/BPE IV: BPE I II III IV</p><p>Results and analysis from the data measured in SC 1235 are currently prepared for publication.</p></div>		</body>
