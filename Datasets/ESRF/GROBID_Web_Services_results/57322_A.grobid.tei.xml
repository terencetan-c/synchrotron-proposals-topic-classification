The previous results on the samples (exp. rep. HC-620) indicated that the asprepared samples retain their amorphous structure in the equilibrium conditions even when exposed to air.</p><p>The absorption spectra acquired during HC-2126 showed however that all the CAMGs samples have severe oxidation and segregation during the measurement. While the precharacterization of the samples prior to XAFS experiment did not point to any detectible oxidation of the films, the Zr K-edge XANES spectra of all of the investigates CAMGs closely resembled XANES of zirconium oxide involving a strong white line not present in the metallic state of Zr (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Also, the Cu K-edge XANES spectra of copper did not look like those measured previously for Cu in Zr-Cu glassy ribbon (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Furthermore, we found that Cu Kedge EXAFS spectra of the CAMGs can be reproduced by Cu-crystal local structure model which suggests segregation of Cu.</p><p>In the course of the experiment, as well during sample preparation and transportation we took very good care of the oxidation issue by storing the samples in the protective atmosphere and transferring them inside a glove-box from the container to an air-tight sample chamber for the absorption measurement. Despite the above efforts, the samples seemed to severely oxidize and segregate immediately already during the first measurement and the consecutive measurements didn't show any time evolution of the absorption spectra.</p><p>The observed behavior is attributed to beam damage of the samples. The presence of oxygen can be explained by a possible leaks of the sample chamber or by generation of color centers (oxygen vacancies) in the substrate material. The generation of color centers by an X-ray beam was observed optically by darkening of the substrate which disappeared after thermal annealing at 300 deg C for 1 hour in air. 8950 9000 9050 9100 9150 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Cu K-edge Zr 50 Cu 50 ribbon Zr 50 Cu 50 CAMG Cu metal foil normalized absorption Energy (eV) Figure 2.

During the last day of our experiment we have successfully measured high quality Cu K-edge EXAFS spectra of a series of over 20 Ti-Cu thin films both in the as-deposited state and after oxidation treatment. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra of selected as-deposited Ti-Cu amorphous films. The EXAFS spectra were fitted to obtain the parameters of local atomic environment of Cu atoms in the investigated systems. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the results of EXAFS fitting. As demonstrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, the interatomic distances Cu-Cu and Cu-Ti are approximately constant over the studied composition range and are nearly perfectly equal to the sum of the metallic radii (2.56 and 2.74 Ã… respectively). According to EXAFS results the disorder in atomic distances (Debye-Waller factor) is significantly higher for Cu-Ti pairs as compared to Cu-Cu. The disorder parameter of Cu-Ti pairs decreases continuously with increasing Cu content (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>). The values of the Debye-Waller factor are typical for those observed in other amorphous metallic systems. We observed that the fraction of Cu-Cu pairs increases continuously with the increasing Cu content and saturates at about 60% of Cu reaching the value corresponding to that derived for random atomic mixing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>). Finally, it we found that small addition of Al atoms (up to 3%) does not affect the short range order of the amorphous films.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> demonstrates a comparison of Cu K-edge XANES spectra for oxidized Ti-Cu samples with different composition. A pronounced variation of the shape of XANES indicates a strong compositional dependence of the electronic state of copper atoms. A detailed analysis of XANES data is in progress and will allow as to interpret the current data together with the results from other experimental methods (Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction).
