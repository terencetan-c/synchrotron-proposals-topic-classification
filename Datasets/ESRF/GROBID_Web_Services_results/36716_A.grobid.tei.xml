<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We had previously collected a 2.8A data set of native crystal, but it was not possible to solve the structure by molecular replacement. In order to identify a heavy metal that bounds to the protein, we analyzed on BM30 beamline the fluorescence of crystal soak with different heavy metal and wash in the free-metal cryo solution. We test 6 different heavy metals complexes (Hg, Pt, Ho, Sm,Os and Gd) 1) Crystal soaked O.N. in 1mM PhenylHgacetate: no fluorescence spectra, diffraction 6A 2) Crystal soaked O.N. in 1mM CNPt: no fluorescence spectra, diffraction 6A</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Data set with Gd-soak crystal was treated with XDS, the presence of an anomalous signal was not evident. We subsequently analyzed with Shelx, the Patterson confirmed the absence of Gd in the crystal.</p><p>We don't find an explication of the totally absence of fluorescence, in particular with the Os (black crystal) and the solution 100mM Gd.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Project: human Lg CRD</head><p>We had previously collected a 2.3Å data set of native crystal, but it was not possible to solve the structure by molecular replacement.</p><p>The protein has Ca sites, so we tried to replace Ca by Gd (with GdCl 3 soaking) in the way to make heavy metal phasing.</p><p>In order to identify Gd that may bind in the Ca site of the protein, we analyzed the fluorescence of soaked crystals washed in free-metal cryo-solution. Analyze of fluorescence spectra reveal the occurrence of Gd in crystal.</p><p>We test 8 different crystals to find best diffraction profile (spots shape, mosaïcity and resolution).</p><p>We collected with the best crystal at λ=1.711Å. A set of 360 images (180 °) was recording and data where treated with XDS. We don't find anomalous signal, Gd seems not be fixed on protein.</p><p>Turkey-egg white lysozyme and glucose isomerase Diffraction data were collected to test the fixation of a europium complex on two proteins :turkey-egg white lysozyme and glucose isomerase from Spectromyces rubiginosus. SAD experiments at the Eu L III absorption edge were attempted. Anomalous signal, allowing the resolution of the structure, was found with the lysozyme crystals.</p><p>Users : Eva Pebay-Peyroula, Hugues Nury, Aurélien Deniaud.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples tested and results :</head><p>• ANC : We tested two crystals which diffracted at low resolution (10-15A), not sufficient to analyse anything.</p><p>• AcrB : We tested eight crystals with the better which diffrated up to 4A. We just collected data on 20° to analyse th espace group.</p><p>• CR : We tested ten crystals, which didn't diffract at all.</p><p>• YedZ-GFP : We tested two small crystals, which didn't diffract.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thiol-oxydoreductase chez Neisseria meningitidis</head><p>DsbA3 : Diffraction data were collected on two native crystals. These crystals diffracted until 3.0 Å resolution. They belong to the hexagonal system 6/m (a=b=126.6 Å c=53.9 Å). We did not manage to determine the precise space group yet. DsbA1 : a full dataset was collected on one single native crystal until 1.5 Å resolution Rsym=6% These crystals belong to the orthorhombic system, space groupe P212121, with the following parameters : a=44.05 Å b=46.40Å c=79.90Å</p></div>			</div>
