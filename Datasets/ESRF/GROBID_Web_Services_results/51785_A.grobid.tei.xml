<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Abstract : Surfactant templated silica thin films were self-assembled on solid substrates by dip-coating using a partly fluorinated surfactant F(CF 2 ) 8 C 2 H 4 (OC 2 H 4 ) 9 OH as the liquid crystal template. The aim was twofold: first we explored the phase diagram to determine the domain of existence of highly ordered crystalline phases and second we exposed the films to sc-CO 2 to foster the removal of the surfactant. The films were characterized by in situ X-Ray Reflectivity (XRR), Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) under CO 2 pressure. GISAXS patterns reveal the formation of a 2-D hexagonal structure at a molar ratio FSN/Si equal to 0.1. We further evidence that the extraction of the template using supercritical carbon dioxide can be successfully achieved since fluorinated surfactants are CO 2 -philic in nature. Very surprisingly the 2D rectangular structure was well preserved after depressurization of the cell and removal of the surfactant.</p><p>Methods: For measurements, the film was placed inside a high pressure cell that was thermo regulated at 34°C ± 0.1°C. Pressure was automatically adjusted via a electromechanical pressure controller with a precision better than 0.1 bar. Specifications about the pressure cell are given in reference <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. All measurements made on these films were carried out at a constant temperature of 34°C. In-situ XRR and GISAXS experiments were performed as a function of CO 2 pressure at the ID10B beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) with a monochromatic x-ray beam of energy 22 keV. The high energy X-rays are required to minimize the absorption of the beam going through the diamond windows of the cell (1 mm) and 35 mm of CO 2 in gas or sc-state. The time scale between each measurement was 30 min. The depressurization process was achieved in 1h.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The experimental results obtained during the pressurization up to 100 bars are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">1</ref>. The experiment was carried out on a fresh film which was not yet stabilized. First, it is noted that XRR curves are not very affected by the elevation of pressure. Below 50 bars, a small increase in d-spacing is observed shown by the shift of the Bragg peak towards lower q z values. This result suggests that CO 2 is penetrating inside the film causing a slight expansion of the structure. However, when the pressure is raised above 50 bars, we observe a contraction of the silica matrix concomitant to an increase of the intensity of the Bragg peaks. To make the story simple, in the framework of Born approximation we can expect that the intensity of the Bragg peaks should be proportional to the electron density contrast</p><p>2 micelle or ) (     e pore e wall I  </p><p>. Therefore an increase in intensity of the Bragg peaks as a function of CO 2 pressure can be associated with the progressive extraction of the surfactant. After the depressurization of the cell, the intensity increases by about 1 order of magnitude compared to the the intensity at 0 bar before CO 2 exposure. If we consider that the initial intensity at 0 bar is proportional to</p><p>2 0 ) (     e micelle e wall I   while the final intensity after the depressurization is proportional to 2 ) (     e pore e wall f I  </p><p>, we obtain a ratio of about 13 which is close to the observed ratio of 10. The small difference between these two values can be explained by a change in pore size. The fairly good agreement between the change of intensity before and after removal of the surfactant is the sign that the surfactant was fully removes after depressurization.    The structural features of mesoporous thin films before and after the CO 2treatment were studied by GISAXS measurements (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2</ref>). The GISAXS patterns show characteristic reflections of the 2D rectangular structure for FSN mesoporous thin film. These reflections can be indexed as reflections on the 11, 13, 20, 22, 02 scattering planes of the 2D centered rectangular unit cell. The GISAXS images show that the mesoporous structure is well preserved after the treatment of the film to sc-CO 2 . The weaker reflections corresponding to planes 13, 22, 20 are hardly observed in the sample after the CO 2 -treatment. The disappearance of these reflections can be assigned to a distortion of the pores due to the shrinkage of the sample on the process of the surfactant removal by sc-CO 2 .</p><p>[1] Mattenet M, Lhoste K, Konovalov O, Fall S, Pattier B and Gibaud A 2010 An X-Ray Thermo-Pressure Cell For Carbon Dioxide .
