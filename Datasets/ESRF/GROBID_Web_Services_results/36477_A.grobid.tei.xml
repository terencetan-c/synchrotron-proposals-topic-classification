<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In order to describe the coordination number of the three Ru atoms in the complex and their ligands, EXAFS measurements were done in transmission mode on the Ru-K-edge (22,117 keV). The adsorption spectra of the samples were acquired between about 300 eV below and 1700 eV above the Ru-K-edge. Data analysis was done with an IFFEFIT package containing FEFF 6.0 and in collaboration with Dr. Ir. Moniek Tromp (University of Southampton). All the spectra were normalised after pre-edge and post-edge background removal. The EXAFS function χ(k) was then calculated from the remaining oscillations in the EXAFS range and Fourier transformed with respect to the distance to the absorbing Ru atom resulting in an atomic radial quasi ditribution around Ru with maxima corresponding to the neighbouring shells of the Ru atoms. This EXAFS spectrum was fitted with one-shell or two-shell models to derive the local structure around Ru: the number of the nearest neighbours (N), the mean distance to them (R), and the distance mean-square fluctuation (σ 2 ) around R, as an indication of the degree of the structural disorder around the Ru atoms.</p><p>The samples were first measured in sealed capillaries but the amount of sample in these capillaries was too small to obtain sufficient signal to noise ratios. Therefore, larger amounts of sample were pressed into pellets. These were placed into an unsealed sample holder with kapton film as an X-ray transparant window. The experiments were performed at room temperature.</p><p>As reference samples served RuCl 3, RuO 2 , RuO 2 .H 2 O, Ru-red, Ru(NH 3 ) 6 Cl 3 and Ru(NO)(NO 3 ) 3 .H 2 O and Ru(5%) on alumina. The reference samples were diluted with dry CVB760.</p><p>The rutheniumcomplex in zeolite Y, obtained after an ion-exchange with RuCl 3 or Ru-red, were measured in several process stages ( after pretreatment, after saturation with NO and after NO release). These samples were not diluted with CVB760.</p><p>The Fourier transform of k 3 χ(k) for the RuO 2 is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. The first main maximum corresponds to the nearest neighbours of Ru: two O atoms at 1.942 Å and four O atoms at 1.986 Å in the TiO 2 -like structure of RuO 2 . The EXAFS standard characteristics of Ru-O were theoretically calculated with the FEFF code. The Fourier transforms for the RuNaY samples after pretreatment are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>. The similarity of the Fourier Transform for RuO 2 and the same position of the first maximum suggest a RuO 2 -like environment around Ru in the zeolite. When these Fourier transforms are back-transformed to k-space, the EXAFS spectra could be successively fitted with a two-shell model. This two-shell model consists of a Ru-O and a Ru-Ru contact. The contact distance of Ru-O is 1.972 ± 0.016 Å, the coordination number is 6.24 ± 0.894 and δσ 2 is 0.003 ± 0.0017. The contact distance of Ru-Ru is 3.561 ± 0.012 Å, the coordination number is 5.239 ± 0.226 and δσ 2 is 0.002 ± 0.001.</p><p>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (a) (b) (c) R (Å) Fourier Transform Magnitude (k 3 χ(k)) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (a) (b) (c) R (Å) Fourier Transform Magnitude (k 3 χ(k)) 2</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the Fourier transforms of the the RuNaY samples after NO adsorption and after NO release. The spectra after NO release are the same as the spectra after NO adsorption. There is also no difference between the samples started with RuCl 3 or Ru-red as Ru source. When these Fourier transforms are backtransformed to k-space, the EXAFS spectra could be totally fitted with a one-shell model consisting of Ru-Ru contact. The contact distance is 2.678 ± 0.0018 Å, the coordination number is 10.32 ± 0.08 and δσ 2 is 0.005± 0.0001. This Ru-Ru distance is in agreement with that of Ru metal particles. Because the whole k-space spectra could be fitted with this model, we can conclude the rutheniumcomplex is no longer present in the zeolite. It is known the complex is stabilized by water. Activation / deactivation diffraction studies have shown that increased tempereatures in the absence of water lead, depending on the oxidizing conditions at the sample, either to RuO 2 or Ru-metal. Measurement of the samples in an unsealed environment, obviously has the same effect as thermal treatment under dry conditions. The EXAFS study could thus verify the reason of deactivation of the material but failed to characterize the active complex. Measurements in improved sample environment will have to be performed to fully characterize the active species.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: FT (k 3 χ(k)) of the EXAFS spectra of Ru(3%)NaY after pretreatment started with RuCl 3 as Ru source (a), Rured as Ru source (b) and the reference material RuO 2 (c).</figDesc></figure>
