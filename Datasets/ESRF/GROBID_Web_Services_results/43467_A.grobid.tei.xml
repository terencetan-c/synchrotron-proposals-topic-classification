<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>X-ray reflectometry (XR) and Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD) measurements were performed on several sets of tethered diblock copolymer films in order to eluciadate the nature of the phase separation in the films.</p><p>The films were prepared in the initial incidence by reacting various (deuterated)polystyrene-blockpolymethylmethacrylate (dPS-PMMA) polymers with the oxide surface of silicon wafers to produce polymer brushes attached at the PMMA end. In total four polymers were used, with mol fractions of dPS ranging from 0.10 -0.45, each comprising a set of which three were made. The first set of samples consisted of thermally annealed films; this procedure induces phase separatation of the immiscible dPS and PMMA blocks. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The second and thirds sets of samples were treated via a solvent exchange process, where a good solvent for both blocks is replaced by a good solvent for only one block. 2 For the second set of samples the selective solvent was cyclohexane (selective for dPS), while for the third set the solvent was acetone (selective for PMMA).</p><p>All the films were measured in both their native state and after treatment with a staining proceedure that is designed to increase the contrast between the polymer blocks.</p><p>GIXD images were collected using a 2D Mar detector. The in-plane scattering was subsequently integrated to a line profile using the Fit2D programme. Scattering normal to the plane was not seen, in line with expectations, as phase separation in these films is psuedo two-dimensional.</p><p>For the thermally annealed films the stain significantly enhances the observed scattering (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), with the position of the peaks being consistent with the values expected for these films. Equally the lack of structure in the f = 0.10 film is consistent with this sample generating a 'uniform'-type structure. 1 With the solvent exchanged films there was a noticeable difference between the two solvents. In the X-ray scattering of acetone treated films the intensity of the observed peak scales with the fraction of polystyrene in the film (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The position of the peak also changes with the polymer composition in line with atomic force microscopy (AFM) images taken of the same films. With the cyclohexane treatment process the correlations were not so strong, though prominent diffraction peaks were still observed in some of the samples (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Again this is consistent with preliminary AFM measurement performed on the film. XR data collected from the films are currently in the process of being modelled and it is hoped that they will give additional information on the structure of the films normal to the surface, particularly the specific location of the PS and PMMA blocks in the solvent exchanged films.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Benjamin O'Driscoll,* Maria Silvi,* and Ian Hamley Department of Chemistry, University of Reading, Whiteknights, Reading, RG6 6AD, UK</figDesc></figure>
