Recently, thediscovery of superconducting two dimensional electronsystem (2DES) in LaAlO3 (or EuO)/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO or EuO/KTO) interfaces triggers a revival in this field. These KTO based interfaces are very appealing. The superconducting critical temperature TC can be higher and the superconductivity depends on crystallineorientations (∼2.2 K and∼0.9 K for KTO(111) andKTO(110) interfaces) compared with LAO/KTO(∼0.2 K). Analogous to the LAO/STO interfaces where 3d electrons are responsible to the interfacialproperties, the 5d electrons in KTO based in-terfaces are supposed to the key ingredient. In LAO/STO interfaces, the Ti 3d electrons are believed to be composed of localized and itinerant types, which is the key issue to understand the origin of the interfacial 2DES and their tranport and magnetic properties. However, the types of Ta 5d electrons in KTO-based interfaces remain veiled and the answer will help to understand the origin and superconductivity of the interfacial 2DES.</p><p>To disclose the interfacial electrons, resonant inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (RIXS) has been proved successful in LAO/STO systems and should have similar power in KTO based interfaces. In LAO/STO systems, the interfaces have Ti 3+ (3d 1 configuration) stateswhich will generate dd excitations using RIXS at the Ti L3 edge. In contrast, the bulk STO with Ti 4+ (3d 0 configuration) will not. And the carrier densities of 2DES based on RIXS data were found to be much higher than the value measured by Hall effect, suggesting the simultaneous existence of localized and itinerant chargecarrier in LAO/KTO interfaces. Similarly, the bulk KTO has Ta 5+ valence (5d 0 configuration) while the EuO/KTO interface show slightly reduced Ta valence by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Nevertheless,the electrons can be either itinerant in the hybridized spd conduction bands or localized in the 5d shell, that is, 5d 1 due to possible localization. And the dd excitation by RIXS, which is sensitive to the existence of carriers (no matter localized or itinerant) at the interface, can help to analyze the interfacial 2DES.</p><p>The LAO/KTO interfaces with (100), ( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">111</ref> The RIXS and XAS measurements were performed at the beamline ID20 of the European Synchrotron Radi-ation Facility (ESRF). The energy resolutions (full width half maximum) were 0.3 eV at ESRF. The KTO interfaces and bulk sample are investigated at Ta L3 edge. XAS was obtained at room temperature (RT) while RIXS measurements were carried out at RT and 20 K. The experimental geometries are illustrated in Fig. 1(d). Grazing incident angle can be used to minimize the x-ray penetration depth and enhance the interfacial signals. The estimated detecting depth is afew nanometer when the incident angle (α) is less than0.2 • and∼100 nm when α= 1 • . The scattering plane (indicated by a shadow plane) is perpendicular to the sample surface. The TFY of all samples are showed in Fig.1 (e). For TFY XAS, the data were obtained with incident angle α= 50 o and RT. The large incident anglemeans that the bulk information are recorded. All KTO samples, no matter interfaces or electron doped bulk, show similar double-peak feature. The double peaks locate at 9883.0 eV and 9886.1 eV respectively. Such feature is typical of Ta 5+ oxide state. In contrast, the XAS of TaS2 sample (see Fig. 1(c)) show single peak with peak position slightly lower than 9883.0 eV. The single peak feature in XAS has also been reported in another Ta compound with 5d 1 electron configuration. By comparison, the XAS of ED KTO is not close toTaS2 but the KTO interfaces where the bulk is insulatingKTO. This is an weak indication of the absence of 5d 1 electrons in ED KTO. FIG. 2. The RIXS spectra of (a,c) LAOKTO(111), (b,d)LAOKTO(110) interfaces. Parameters for the spectra: (a,c) α= 1 o , energy resolution 0.3 eV,vaied incident energy, (b,d) Ein= 9879 eV, energy resolution 0.3 eV, varied α.</p><p>To reveal the interfacial electronic structures, RIXS was performed on the superconducting KTO interfaces. We first focus on the LAO/KTO(111) interface. The RIXS spectra were obtained at RT with geometry showed in Fig. <ref type="figure">1(d)</ref>. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">2(a</ref> Since the KTO interfaces are actually ED KTO, we did RIXS measurement on the ED KTO bulk materials. As showed in Fig. 3, the dd excitation is still absent in ED KTO samples, no matter with incident angle α= 1 o ,45 o or photon energy Ein=9879 eV, 9883 eV. Furthermore, by comparing with the RIXS spectra of the insulating KTO, the spetra of two samples can be scaled well together. These results show that even in the ED KTO bulk materials, the density of Ta 5d characteristic electrons is too low to be detected. FIG. 3. The RIXS spectra of ED KTO (blue curves) andinsulating KTO (orange curves). The spectra are scaled andshifted. To understand the type of electrons in KTO based in-terfaces and KTO bulk materials. We compare our resultwith the previous results on STO. Our KTO interfaces has higher itinerant electrons than STO interfaces measured by Hall effect. However, the dd excitations appear in the RIXS spectra of STO interfaces, which should be attributed to the existence of high density of localized Ti 3d 1 electrons. The absence of dd excitations in KTO interfaces means that the localized Ta 5d 1 electrons should be absent or at least with very low density. Based on our simulation, the density of the itinerant Ta 5d characteristic electrons is at the edge of the observable dd exitations. The existence of localized Ta 5d 1 electrons will further contribute to the dd exitations and make such exitations observable. As the dd exitations are absent in our experiments, these localized Ta 5d 1 electrons should be absent. The absence should be related to the properties of KTO. In ED KTO which has slightly lower electron density than ED STO, the dd exitations again disappear. This indicates the localized Ta 5d1electrons will not form in ED KTO. As the spacial extension of 5delectrons is much larger compared with 3d electrons. The subsequent larger hopping terms for 5d electrons guarantee their delocalization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>FIG. 1.
