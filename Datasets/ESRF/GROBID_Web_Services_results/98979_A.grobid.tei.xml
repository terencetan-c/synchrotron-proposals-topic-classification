<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>The Rh-based catalysts has been recently shown promising selectivity towards ethanol in CO2 hydrogenation. Via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), a powerful tool for the construction of well-defined model catalysts for an array of reactions, we have synthesized size-homogeneous Rh nanoparticles doped with Mn or Fe on SiO2 (RhMn@SiO2 and RhFe@SiO2) with tailored interfaces to rationalize the effect of various metal promoters. By conducting ex situ as well as in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments to identify the speciation of these bimetallic catalysts especially under working state, we hope to elucidate the interplay between structure and catalytic performance for Rh-based catalyst. In combination with other spectroscopic (IR, XPS), microscopic (TEM, STEM-HAADF, EDX) techniques and computational approaches (AIMD or static DFT) on these catalysts, we hope to clarify the promotional effect of metal promoters and the associated reaction mechanism. The outcomes of this proposal will enable to rationally design the next generation of catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation, which would have an important impact on decarbonizing our economy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data obtained and experimental parameters</head><p>In situ X-ray adsorption spetrac data were collected on powered sample of Rh@SiO2, RhMn@SiO2 and RhFe@SiO2, packed into the quartz capillaries (1.5 mm for Rh, 1.0 mm for Mn and Fe). Data were collected at beam energies range from 23.1-24.1 keV for the Rh K, from 6.4-7.1 keV for the Mn K, and from 7.0-8.0 keV for the Fe K. Flow rates (Ar, H2, CO2) were controlled using mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst), and pressure was set at 20 bar using a back pressure regulator (Bronkhorst, EL-PRESS). The temperature for H2 reduction (400 o C) and CO2 hydeogenation (230 o C) were maintained using a nitrogen blower. Prior to measurements, a K-type thermocouple mounted inside a sample cell was used for the temperature calibration. Outlet gas was detected using a mass spetrometer (MS, Pfeiffer vacuum) mounted after the back-pressure regulator.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Scheme for the temperature profile for a typical experiment.</p><p>In a typical experiment, EXAFS spetra were first collected after the sample was mounted and exposed to air. Subsequently, H2 pretreatment was carried out under 10 mL/min of H2 for 1 h at 400 o C (300 o C h -1 ramp), while continously collecting XANES spectra. After the pretreatment and cool down room temperature, EXAFS spetra were collected for the reduced sample. Then, heating to reaction temperature (230 o C) under 10 mL of H2/Ar mixture (300 o C h -1 ramp), followed pressurizing to 20 bar and keeping 20 min. Subsequently, switching to CO2/H2/Ar mixture for CO2 hydrogenation 2 h. Notably, the XANES spetra were continously collected druing the this entire protocol. After CO2 hydrogenation, the gas was switched to Ar and the temperature was cooled to room teperature for the post-CO2-hydrogenation EXAFS spectra. Regarding the bimetallic sample. Rh K XAS spectra and Mn or Fe K XAS spectra due to the great differece in beam energies were separately collected under the identical in situ conditions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further work and anticipated output</head><p>The XAS data has currently been processed. The XAS data has already shown insights into the evolution of catalyst structure in the duration of H2 pretreatment and CO2 hydrogenation, such as the alloying and the oxidation of M (representing the promoter like Fe or Mn) inducing the formation of the M-O-Rh interface. The in situ IR will be further carried out to monitor the differences in the intermediates over the Rh-based catalysts in the absence and presence of promoters. Two manuscripts for the role of Mn and Fe for the Rh-based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation are expected once the complementary characterizations are at hand.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>van Beek, Dr. Dragos Stoian Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Wei Zhou*, Scott Docherty*, Xiaoyu Zhou*, Christian Ehinger* Laboratorium für Anorganische Chemie, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zürich, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland</figDesc></figure>
