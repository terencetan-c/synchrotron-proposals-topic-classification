<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The main goal of the previous experiments was to resolve the local fine structure of the extracellular matrix, mesoglea, of the freshwater polyp hydra. Hydras were provided by the group of Prof. Holstein (Univ. Heidelberg). Mesoglea was isolated from several hydras by a freeze-thaw process. After deposition on silicon nitride windows the mesogleas were allowed to dry on air.</p><p>Grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments were carried out at ID13. The samples were subjected to a symmetric nano-focused beam (200 nm) at an incident angle, α = 0.457°, beyond the critical angle of total reflection. Two sets of experiments were performed. In each set several two dimensional mesh scans were done. In the first part of the experiments the mesoglea main body axis was oriented parallel to the incident beam direction. In the second part the mesoglea was rotated 90° to align the main a b γ body axis perpendicular to the direction of the incident beam. Figure 2 represents two of the recorded scattering patterns. The reciprocal space lattice of collagen type I fibres in hydra mesoglea is deduced from the position of the observed Laue zones and satellite peaks in each pattern. Analysis of the reciprocal space revealed a distorted hexagonal packing order of collagen molecules in the fibres. The calculated real space lattice parameters are shown in table 1. a[nm] b[nm] γ[°] Beam parallel to body axis 15.5 4.4 98.2 Beam perpendicular to body axis 8.2 4.2 104.9 Figure 2.
