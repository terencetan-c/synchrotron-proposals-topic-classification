<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The experiment no. HE-175 was originally planed to be performed on FesPt using high pressure and external magnetic field in a cryostat which had to be installed at ID18 at the beamtime allocated in July 1997. This special cryostat, however, was not yet available. The beam line leader (Dr. R.Riiffer) and the groups O.Leupold (Hamburg) and G.Wortmann (Paderborn) offered us to use our beamtime in performing new experiments using nuclear resonant scattering at the 21.5 keV resonance of 151Eu, since we have a longstanding experience in the field of valence instability and related phenomena.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Here, we want to show first experimental results on Eu intermetallic compounds which are known to reveal valence transitions as a function of temperature. We have used a monochromatic beam with a 7 meV bandwidth and a detecting system with a time resolution of about 1.4 nsec. The performed measurements required 5 shifts in 16 bunch mode.</p><p>EuPtP is an inhomogeneous mixed valent compound (NizIn-structure) which undergoes two temperature-induced structural phase transitions at T i = 235 K and Tz = 190 K, where the ratio of the static mixture Eu2+/Eu3+ changes at the phase transitions. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we demonstrate a modulation of the time structure of the nuclear exitation. Above T1 one has only a Eu2+ signal from the EuPtP sample. In order to have quantum beats in the spectrum at this temperature (300 K) we measured EuPtP together with a EuFs reference which has a stable valence with a different isomer shift. Below T1 the ratio Eu2+/Eu 3+ changes to 2:l and below T2 to 1:l. The spectrum at 105 K exhibits the most intense quantum beat pattern due to the 1:l ratio. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Nuclear resonant scattering spectra of EuPtP at three different structural phases with different ratios of the static mixture of Eu2+/Eu3+. EuPdsB is another inhomogeneous mixed valent compound (AuCus-structure) where a possible charge ordering occurs below T x 115 K (similar to Errs&amp;). In Fig. 2 one can clearly see a pronounced change of the modulation of frequency of the time spectra below 115 K (at 88 K and 25 K) where the Eu ions are ordered into a static mixture of Eu2+ and Eu3+. The small decrease of the linewidth of the nuclear resonance between 159 K and 300 K indicates increasing fluctuation rate as the temperature increases.EuNi2Pz is a homogeneous intermediate valent compound (ThCr2Si2-structure). As shown in Fig.3the increase of the frequency shift of the time spectra with decreasing temperature relative to the Eu2+ reference absorber (EuS) is consistent with a valence shift from a nearly Eu3+ state to an intermediate valence state closer to the Eu2+ state.</figDesc></figure>
