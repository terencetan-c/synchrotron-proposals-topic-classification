<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Objectives</head><p>Both N 2 and Xe are inert under ambient conditions and hardly interact with other elements. Under pressure, the properties of both elements drastically change and their chemistry becomes richer. The XeF 2 solid [1] as well as the Xe 3 O 2 and Xe 2 O 5 [2] compounds have been formed at high pressure and have shown to be composed of covalent bonds. Recently, we have produced the first xenon nitride with indications of N-N and Xe-N single covalent bonds [3], similar to theoretically predicted XeN 6 solid <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The aim of this proposal was to characterize this newly-synthesized Xe-N compound by X-ray diffraction in order to determine its structure and stoechiometry. Pressure and temperatures in the range 150 GPa -200 GPa and 1500 -3000 K, respectively, were generated in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell so as to enter the stability domain of the Xe-N solid. During sample decompression, X-ray diffraction measurements at regular pressure steps were attempted so as to obtain the compound's equation of state as well as its stability domain.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental method</head><p>Three membrane diamond anvil cells were equipped with anvils of 70 (2x) and 50 µm in culet size. All cells were loaded with a Xe-N 2 mixture, with xenon concentrations of 20, 15 and 5 mol%. A gold particle was loaded along with the sample and its equation of state was used to determine the pressure inside the experimental chamber. While chemical insulation of the sample was previously shown not to be necessary, one of the samples (with 20 mol% Xe) had a thin Al 2 O 3 layer deposited on both diamond anvils and acted as a thermal insulator. Double-sided YAG laser-heating was performed with the on-line setup of ID27, allowing black-body radiation temperature measurements. Angular dispersive powder X-ray diffraction was performed, using a monochromatic beam of energy E = 33 keV, between each pressure step as well as before and after laser-heating. The X-ray diffraction images were collected with an on-line image plate detector (MARCCD). The beam was focussed down to ~ 3x3 µm 2 .</p><p>Previously to the beamtime, all samples were dynamically compressed to 70 GPa. This rapid compression prevented the formation of the Xe(N 2 ) 2 van der Waals compound, previously established to be extremely stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> and hinder the synthesis of the Xe-N compound. In doing so, amorphous Xe and N 2 (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 a</ref>)) were observed before laser-heating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The results obtained are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The first sample (20 mol% Xe) was compressed to 170 GPa, pressure at which it was laser-heated to 2300 K for a few minutes. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, laser-heating of the amorphous Xe+N 2 mixture resulted in many new diffraction lines. While some diffraction lines match Xe(N 2 ) 2 or the high pressure and high temperature phase of Al 2 O 3 , others fit with the previously-observed Xe-N covalently-bonded solid. Decompression of the sample was then attempted, but after a 5 GPa pressure decrease one of the diamonds gave away, allowing the sample to escape the experimental chamber.  The second sample, of greater nitrogen concentration (5 mol% Xe) and without an insulating layer on the diamond anvils, was laser-heated to 2500 K at 148 GPa. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, diffraction rings similar to those observed from the first sample appeared. Again, some of them correspond to the diffraction lines of Xe(N 2 ) 2 or the Xe-N compound, but others match cg-N. The synthesis of a pure form of nitrogen, cg-N, not found in the previous run, indicates the Xe-N compound to be of nitrogen concentration between 80 and 95 mol% N 2 . Once again, a diamond anvil broke when attempting sample decompression. The last sample was prepared with a 15 mol% Xe concentration. To favor the synthesis of the Xe-N compound instead of Xe(N 2 ) 2 , pressure was increased to 205 GPa before laser-heating. However, one of the anvils ruptured during heating, releasing the pressure and therefore the sample. A deeper analysis of the data obtained during the three experimentals runs will be necessary to solve the structure of the Xe-N compound.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: X-ray diffraction image plates of a Xe-N 2 sample (20 mol% Xe) at 170 GPa. (Left) As seen, before laserheating the sample appears amorphous and does not show diffraction rings characteristic of the Xe(N 2 ) 2 van der Waals compound. This was observed from all dynamically-compressed samples. The diffraction spots belong either to the diamond anvils or the thin Al 2 O 3 layer. (Right) Image plate after laser-heating the sample at 2300 K at 170 GPa. Diffraction rings appear and some match those previously observed and assigned to a new Xe-N compound.
