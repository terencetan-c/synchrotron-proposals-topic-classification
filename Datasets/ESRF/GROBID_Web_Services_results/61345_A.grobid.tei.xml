<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Layered cobalt oxide compounds LnBaCo 2 O 5+x (where Ln -rare earth cation) have a perovskite-derived structure. Theses materials are characterized by unusual magnetic and electric transport properties [ 1 , 2 ]. Cobalt cations can exist in different oxidation and spin states. With an ideal oxygen stoichiometry of 5.5 per formula unit, the average oxidation state of Co is 3+. For Co 3+ ions, high spin, low spin, and intermediate spin states are possible [ 3 ]. One can suggest that spin state transitions can be induced not only by changing temperature but also due to transfer of these materials into the nanostructured states. The transfer of single-crystalline or coarse-grain cobaltites containing Co 3+ ions to the nanostructured state should lead to the Co 3+ → Co 2+ transition or to the appearance of low-spin instead of high-spin Co 3+ ions.</p><p>Cobalt-doped anatase Ti 1-x Co x O 2 nanopowders are characterized by ferromagnetic properties (see, for example, our work [ 4 ] and references therein). Therefore, an information concerning the valence state of cobalt impurity atoms is very important for understanding nature of ferromagnetism in these compounds.</p><p>We have studied the following systems: (i) nanostructured samples of EuBaCo 2 O 5.5 and TbBaCo 2 O 5.5 in which nanostates were obtained by milling and by shear deformation under pressure, respectively; (ii) cobalt-doped anatase Ti 1-x Co x O 2 nanopowders; (iii) iron-doped anatase Ti 1-x Fe x O 2 nanopowders; (iv) carbon encapsulated Fe@C nanoparticles. As reference compounds, pure Co and Fe metals, single crystalline CoO (Co 2+ ions) and LaCoO 3 (Co 3+ ions) samples were used.</p><p>The experiments were performed on the MB20 beamline. XAS spectra were simultaneously measured both in total fluorescence yield (TFY) mode and in high-energy-resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) mode. Co Kβ and Fe Kβ X-ray emission spectra were measured in normal and resonant modes. Resonant</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra were obtained too. Some XES measurements were carried out at temperature of 100 K.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Co K X-ray absorption spectra (in HERFD mode) of a LaCoO 3 single crystal and EuBaCo 2 O 5.5 and TbBaCo 2 O 5.5 ceramics in the initial and nanostructured states are presented. Nanostructured powder of EuBaCo 2 O 5.5 was obtained by milling the initial coarse-grained powder in a ball mill for 9 h [<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> ]. The nanostructured state of TbBaCo 2 O 5.5 was obtained by shear deformation under pressure of 7 GPa with the rotation angle of one anvil with respect to another equal to 180° [ 6 ]. The lack of a Co K edge shift indicates that the Co valence state remains unchanged (3+). The prepeak at about 7710 eV mainly reflects the density of empty Co 3d orbitals hybridizated with oxygen 2p orbitals. One can suggest that the lowest unoccupied states in EuBaCo 2 O 5.5 and TbBaCo 2 O 5.5 correspond to the t 2g states.  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows Co Kβ 1,3 X-ray emission spectra of LaCoO 3 and EuBaCo 2 O 5.5 in the initial state and after milling for 9 h. The spectra were measured at room temperature (300 K) and at temperature of about 100 K. The spectra measured at 100 K are characterized by the low Kβ' satellite intensity in comparison with the spectra measured at room temperature. It means that a transition of a small part of high-spin Co 3+ ions to the low-spin state occurred at low temperatures.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows RIXS spectra of EuBaCo 2 O 5.5 in the initial state (a) and after milling for 9 h (b). RIXS data are shown here as a contour map in a plane of incident and transferred photon energies, where the vertical axis represents the energy difference between the incident and emitted energies. The spectra appeared to be closely allied. No extra structure in the pre-edge region was found. Therefore, the oxidation state of Co ions in these samples is the same: 3+.</p><p>In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, Co K X-ray absorption spectra (in HERFD mode) of Ti 0.96 Co 0.04 O 2 nanopowders in the as-prepared state, after annealing at 700 °C in vacuum or in hydrogen are shown. For comparison, the spectra of Co metal and CoO are presented. The spectra of the samples after heating are similar but differ from the spectrum of the as-prepared sample. the incident energy of 7709 eV.
