<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this study is to define experimental preparation conditions for the stabilization of the highly anisotropic L1 0 -chemically ordered FePt phase with addition of a third element (Mn).</p><p>Manganese is able to affect significantly not only the structural and chemical order, but also the spin configuration due to antiferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Fe moments [Meyer et al.,   Phys.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Two different series were investigated as summarized in the following tables. Preliminary characterization: X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed in order to confirm the presence of desirable (001)-texture and L1 0 ordering. For the magnetic characterization, superconducting quantum interference device -vibrating sample magnetometry (SQUID-VSM) with magnetic fields up to 70 kOe was carried out at room temperature. Resulting hysteresis loops (not shown) confirm that prepared samples possess an out-of-plane easy axis of magnetization. Nevertheless, a hysteresis with a non-zero remanence for in-plane geometry is still present consistent with the presence of the (111) reflection in XRD. Furthermore a significant decrease in magnetization was observed with increase of Mn concentration (40 -60% compare to L1 0 -FePt), which suggests the presence of antiparallel coupling between Fe and Mn moments.</p><p>EXAFS characterization: XAS data collection was carried out at the Mn-K  (6539 eV), Fe-K  (7112 eV), and Pt-L III (11564 eV) edges with the polarization vector of the X-ray beam being either parallel or perpendicular to the sample surface in order to enhance the sensitivity to differently oriented bonds for the two cases. This approach provides more detailed description of the anisotropic distribution of atoms within the alloy. The angle between the X-ray polarization vector and the normal to the surface was 75° in parallel and 15° in perpendicular configuration, and this latter condition permitted also the minimization of the coherent scattering signal from the Si substrate and to enhance the fluorescence from the atoms under study. During data collection, the samples were kept at a temperature of 100 K to reduce the thermal atomic vibrations thus enhancing the EXAFS signal. The absorption coefficient was measured via the fluorescence yield from Mn-K  , Fe-K  and Pt-L III lines using an energy-resolving (12)-elements high purity germanium detector (energy resolution of about 250 eV</p><p>). XAS data extraction and fitting was carried out with the ATHENA and ARTEMIS codes (Ravel &amp; Newville, J. Synchrotron Rad. 12 (2005) 537) while quantitative modelling was based on simulated EXAFS signals using the FEFF8.1 code (Ankudinov et al., Phys. Rev. B 58 (1998) 7565).</p><p>Although the full analysis of all the data acquired at the Mn-K, Fe-K and Pt-L III edges for the two series of samples is still in progress, the preliminary analysis revealed fundamental aspects related to the deposition process which will be taken into account for the future experiments. In particular, the study is aimed at determining the role of the Mn atoms in FePtMn L1 0 alloys on the magnetic properties, being the latter strongly dependent on the chemical and structural properties and, in particular, on the chemical ordering. The analysis at the Pt edge, carried out by fitting the data with a substitutional model developed for a similar system (FePtCu, Laureti et al. J.</p><p>Applied Crystallography, 47 (2014) 1722), (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, 2, 3, table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) revealed a fraction of the ordered L1 0 phase that is not significantly affected by the presence of the Mn third element differently to what previously observed for FePtCu. Such a result is consistent with the analysis of the Mn-K  data, which showed that a significant amount of Mn is not included into the alloy, being surrounded by oxygen atoms to form a Mn x O y stable phase. However, a preliminary magnetic characterization carried out by SQUID-VSM revealed a strong magnetic anisotropy which was attributed to a high ordering degree, that is actually not supported by the EXAFS analysis carried out with such a model, which gives values for the X ordering parameter below 0.4 (i.e. only 40% of ordered phase). Such a discrepancy may be attributed to the presence, in some samples, of a significant fraction of (111) oriented grains; in other words, the coexistence of the ( <ref type="formula">100</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">111</ref>) growth directions may affect the EXAFS spectra being the atomic arrangement around the absorber atom in the parallel and perpendicular configuration different for the two orientations.</p><p>On the basis of these preliminary results we are currently developing a new model which is able to account for the different Pt-Pt and Pt-Fe in plane and out of plane distances in the two orientations. The comparison between the two models applied at the Pt, Mn and Fe edges is still under progress.     Session 2 (November 18-23) : EXAFS study of the chemical and structural evolution of L1 0 FePt alloy directly synthesized from FePtCl 6 •6H 2 O precursor Participants: S. Laureti (main proposer), A. Capobianchi, E. Patrizi, A. Puri, F. D'Acapito Aim The experiment was aimed at studying the structural and atomic evolution of the FePtCl 6 •6H 2 O salt during its transformation, during annealing, to the chemically ordered FePt L1 0 alloy. Generally, FePt nanoparticles are obtained in the chemically disordered fcc phase, and a post-growth annealing treatment at about 600°C is necessary to induce the transition to the chemically ordered fct phase (L1 0 ). The high annealing temperature of this process possesses noticeable drawbacks like particle coalescence phenomena with the consequent increase of the particle size, size dispersion, and reduction of the magnetic anisotropy. Recently, a new chemical strategy has been reported, aimed at obtaining the direct synthesis of L1 0 FePt alloy nanoparticles starting from a polycrystalline molecular compound, the iron (II) chloroplatinate hexahydrate (FePtCl 6 •6H 2 O), in which Fe and Pt atoms are arranged on alternating planes (fig.1) like in the fct FePt structure [A.Capobianchi, M. Colapietro,D. Fiorani, S. Foglia, P. Imperatori, S.Laureti, E. Palange Chemistry of Materials 21 (2009) 2007; A. Capobianchi, G. Campi, M. Camalli, C. Veroli, Z. Kristallogr. 224 (2009) 384-388]. The reduction of such compound by 5% H 2 and 95% Ar at a reduced temperature (400°C) leads directly to a highly ordered L1 0 phase. From a thermodynamic point of view, the peculiar Fe-Pt atomic arrangement on alternating planes, as in the crystalline structure of FePtCl 6 •6H 2 O, represents the driving force for the direct formation of the fct FePt alloy during the heating process; thus, the crystalline structure of FePtCl 6 •6H 2 O used for the synthesis acts as a precursor to directly obtain the chemically ordered L1 0 FePt phase. In order to follow the thermal evolution of the system, in a previous work the heating process of the FePtCl 6 •6H 2 O powder under reductive atmosphere was monitored by a thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) but it was not possible to isolate and characterize each single step, the processes being partially overlapped.</p><p>A combination of ex-situ and in situ XAS experiments have been carried out at the Pt-L III and Fe-K  edges with the aim of describing the local environment around the metals during the thermal reduction of the precursor salt and to elucidate the mechanism at the basis of such structural evolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment Description and Preliminary Analysis</head><p>The powder of the crystalline precursor salt FePtCl 6</p><p>•6H 2 O has been previously prepared in our home laboratory according to the synthesis proposed in [A.Capobianchi, M. Colapietro, D. Fiorani, S. Foglia, P. Imperatori, S.Laureti, E. Palange Chemistry of Materials 21 (2009) 2007]. The initial and final phases together with different samples taken at intermediate steps of the annealing treatment have been prepared by heating the precursor salt at 5°C/min under a reductive H 2 /Ar atmosphere and stopping the process at 200°C, 300°C and 400°C. For these stages, the preliminary structural (XRD) and magnetic (SQUID and VSM) characterizations gave evidence of a magnetically soft FePt fcc structure (i.e. chemically disordered phase) which is actually not expected as an intermediate structure between two (initial and final) ordered crystallographic phases.</p><p>The XAS experiment consisted in two parts:</p><p>ex-situ analysis:</p><p>The local structural evolution during the treatment has been studied by EXAFS carried out on the powder samples prepared in the home laboratory at the Fe-K and Pt-L III , edges in transmission mode, in order to obtain a description of the local environment around these metals in the initial crystal, during the treatment (i.e. in samples annealed at intermediate temperature) and in the final product.</p><p>in-situ analysis:</p><p>Samples of FePtCl 6 •6H 2 O crystalline film has been put into a heating cell designed for in-situ X-ray absorption experiments at high temperature and under a reactive atmosphere (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).  Fig. 4 Comparison between XANES spectra at the Fe-Ka edge for the FePtCl 6 •H2O sample before the treatment (a) after the in-situ treatment (b) and for the FePt alloy obtained after the FePtCl 6 •H2O treatment in the home laboratories (c).</p><p>Before the in-situ experiment the furnace conditions (5°C/min temperature ramp; H 2 /Ar gas flow) have been carefully set in order to ensure the process reproducibility, which has been tested by comparing the EXAFS spectra of the sample after treatment with the ex-situ spectra of a FePt L1 0 sample obtained in the home furnace. The annealing has been performed by heating the sample at 400 °C with a rate of 5 °C/min, under H 2 /Ar reductive atmosphere. Quick-XANES spectra have been collected at the Fe-K and Pt-L III edge in transmission mode, during two separated processes to follow the chemical/structural evolution around the two elements during the treatment. Spectra of 4s/each have been collected at a rate of 3 spectra/minute every 10 °C of the heating process. The same apparatus has been also used to carry out static EXAFS experiments in stationary temperature conditions (i.e. EXAFS spectra acquired at defined temperatures of the heating treatment). In fig. 5 the comparison between different quick-XANES spectra collected during the treatment at the Fe-K edge highlights the clear evolution of the chemical environment and electronic state of the absorber atoms.</p><p>Session 3 (April 12-19) : The IrMn/NiFe exchange coupled bilayer: a structural and chemical analysis by EXAFS Participants: S.

Up to now, the best performance in terms of EB strength has been found in systems with the IrMn alloy as AFM. Actually, for the IrMn 3 composition, two different phases have been observed: a chemically disordered face-centered cubic structure (-IrMn 3 ), and a chemically ordered L1 2 phase, where planes of Mn atoms and mixed Ir and Mn atoms alternate along the 001 direction, without affecting however, the lattice parameters (i.

Although the magnetic anisotropy of the disordered phase ensures a large EB field and thermal stability suitable for application, in a recent paper[A. Kohn, Sci. Rep., 2013, DOI:   10.1038/srep02412], a significant variation in the magnetization reversal mechanism and in the EB field has been experimentally demonstrated when the FM layer is exchange coupled to the chemical ordered L1 2 -IrMn 3 phase. The amount of L1 2 phase, that positively affects the EB strength at the AF/FM interface, is generally influenced by the buffer layer used for the Ir 25 Mn 75 alloy deposition. However, recent experiments have shown that the strength of the coupling is also increased by thermal annealing. The aim of this experiment was to elucidate the effect of different buffer layer (Cu or NiFe) and of the thermal effects (deposition temperature or postdeposition thermal annealing) on the structural and chemical order and, consequently, to correlate it to the observed magnetic properties. Moreover, the presence of a very thin Cu intralayer at the FM/AFM interface resulted in a further modulation of the exchange bias effect. In this experiment, the high sensitivity of the technique has been used to investigate the atomic arrangement around the Cu atoms in a Ir 25 Mn 75 /Cu (0.2 nm) /Ni 80 Fe 20 sample.This activity is part of a national project (FIRB-2012-1016, Project Coordinator: S. Laureti; Unit responsible: F. Spizzo) titled "NANOREST-Tailoring the magnetic anisotropy of nanostructures for enhancing the magnetic stability of magnetoresistive junctions", which includes the study of arrays of sub-50 nm perpendicular spin valves in which each electrode consists of Ir 25 Mn 75 /Ni 80 Fe 20 exchange coupled phases prepared by sputtering.</figDesc></figure>
