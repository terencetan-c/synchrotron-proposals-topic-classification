<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In-situ foaming of silicone based nanocomposites Report:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim and Objectives</head><p>The purpose of the experiments was to monitor the evolution of the cellular structure during foaming of polymer matrices by in situ micro-radiography and tomography. Foaming can me divided into three stages which involve the formation of gas bubbles in a liquid system, and the growth and stabilisation of those bubbles as the matrix increases its viscosity and solidifies. In particular, the system under study is foamed by the condensation reaction between silanols (SiOH) on hydroxyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane and silanes (SiH) on polymethylhydrogensilane in presence of a catalyst with the evolution of hydrogen gas. Hence, gas is produced as a by-product of the reaction, leading to the nucleation and growth of bubbles within a fluid whose rheology evolves from a low viscosity liquid to a viscoelastic gel.</p><p>The aim was to study the effect of nanofillers on the morphology and dynamics of polymer foams and to understand the effect of the nanofiller shape by adding two morphologically different carbon-based nanofillers, in particular multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNT) and functionalised graphene sheets (FGS).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The experiments were carried out on beamline ID19 using two resolutions with the effective pixel sizes of 15 μm and 2.8 μm. A full analysis has not yet been completed. Preliminary observations are reported below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a) Tomography</head><p>Tomography experiments were not successful enough to provide 3D data sets of the initial stages of the foaming process. These initial stages were too fast for the detector and rotation stage used and we observed motion artefacts which are preventing the proper reconstruction and analysis of the geometrical evolution of the samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Although we tried to slowdown the reaction by cooling the reactants prior to mixing in a fridge and by directing cool air to the sample container during the tomography recording, the motion artifacts were still visible. Nevertheless, at later stages of the foaming process motion artifacts were no longer visible and provided full 3D reconstruction of the samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). At this later stages, foams evolve through internal processes, such as gas diffusion, drainage and cell coalescence, leading to comparatively little changes in the bubble structure. Initial analysis of the data shows clear differences on cell size, roundnes and connectivity. The full analysis of the generated data is still under way. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>b) Radiography</head><p>Radiography experiments were successfully applied to the analysis of the foaming process of the samples. Motion artefacts were not visible on radiograph images and provided more detailed information on the foaming dynamics of the system. Initial inspection of the radiographs shows clear differences on the temporal evolution of the foaming process. Filled samples evolved more slowly than unfilled samples and it is possible to observe the early stages of the foam (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Several physical phenomena of foam formation and stabilisation can be observed, from the diffusion of gas from small bubbles to large bubbles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) to film ruptures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Results from both tomography and radiography experiments have shown clearly that the inclusion of nanofillers affect the evolution of the foaming process. Furthermore, initial optical flow analysis shows differences due to nanofiller morphology on the foaming evolution of the system.</p><p>Full analysis of the data obtained is in progress and is expected to lead to the publication of several papers. The reported results suggest that faster tomography scans would provide further information on the material morphology evolution which will enable a deeper understanding on the foaming evolution and dynamics.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Raquel Verdejo* (Inst.
