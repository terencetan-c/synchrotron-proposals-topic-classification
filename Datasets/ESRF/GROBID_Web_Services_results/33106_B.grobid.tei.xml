<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Xray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and room and low temperature (RT/LT) resonant inelastic Xray scattering (RIXS) measurements were performed on BaVS 3 single crystals at the vanadium L 3 edge.</p><p>XAS was measured using the drain current on a sample mounted asreceived and on a sample cleaved in air. A very marked change was observed in the shape of the V Ledge spectrum as a result of cleaving though an O K signal was still observed. XAS measurements on an insitu cleaved sample are pending to confirm the validity of the XAS spectrum we used to select excitation energies. Note that the allphoton RIXS experiment is much less sensitive to surface contamination compared to a drain current XAS measurement.</p><p>RIXS spectra were taken on a sample mounted in the AXES chamber with the caxis in the horizontal plane and parallel to the sample holder.</p><p>Eight energies in the vicinity of the V L 3 absorption edge were measured, for the vertical (V) and horizontal (H) polarizations of incident photons (s and p polarization relative to the sample respectively). The energy calibration was set using the V L 3 absorption spectrum as measured by XAS (see Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). poin t E(eV) A1 511.94 A 512.44 A2 512.94 B0 513.75 B 514.25 B1 514.75 E1 517.36 E 517.86 Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the Xray emission spectra taken at room temperature (RT) with vertical (V, ppolarization, E ⊥ c) and horizontal polarization (H, spolarization: the sample normal is turned 10° with respect to the incident beam, E and c are in the horizontal plane).</p><p>The spectra are plotted on an energyloss scale. Two large structures and one shoulder are observed to the low energy side of the elastic peak. At the photon energy of 513.75 eV (B0 spectrum), their energy positions relative to the elastic peak are -1.9 eV, -4.9 eV and -6.7 eV.</p><p>Large lowenergyloss structures are present in all the spectra and disperse on an energyloss scale as from 512.44 eV (A). It is difficult to say if they disperse from A1 to A as well. There is a slight polarization dependence of these structures in spectra B0 and B.</p><p>The structure closer to the elastic peak is clearly observed in the B0 spectrum. Similar structure is less marked in spectra B1 and B. In all the spectra, it has approximately the same intensity as in the case of spolarization. In the case of Hpolarization, turning the incident photon angle shows changes in intensities in large lowenergyloss structure, indicating that it is consists of nonresonant features (xray fluorescence) as well as resonant features, appearing when photon energy is tuned to particular values.</p><p>Cooling to 25K changes slightly lowenergyloss structures, but destroys their V/H polarization dependence.</p><p>According to the LDADOS calculations in the orthorhombic phase [1], from 6 eV to 1 eV below the Fermi level, the V 3d orbitals (mixed t 2g and e g ) are strongly hybridized with sulfur 3p orbitals. The t 2g orbitals are distributed over the valence band from 6 eV to -1 eV while the e g orbitals peak at about -3.5 eV. Just below the Fermi level, and separated from the sulfurhybridized part of the valence band, the DOS consist of A 1g , E g1 and E g2 t 2g bands.</p><p>In the unoccupied part of the calculated DOS, there are three peaks, one close to E F , one at about 1.5 eV, and one at 2.3 eV. The first has small e g + A 1g character, and very strong Eg character. The second has increased, e g and A 1g contributions, but E g vanishes. In the third, e g dominates. We should note that the DMFT calculations, including correlations, modify considerably the DOS structures close to the Fermi level, pushing E g states to lower energies and introducing an upper Hubbard band in unoccupied A 1g and E g states.</p><p>Assuming the xray Raman features observed are directly related to elementary excitations close to the ground state, symmetry considerations would suggest that the observed structure can be interpreted as follows : 1. The peak at -0.5 e V corresponds to A 1g , E g -&gt; E g excitations 2. At -2 e V corresponds to A 1g , E g -&gt; e g excitations 3. At -6 e V corresponding to transitions involving wellbound e g -&gt; e g bands The first excitation is very close to the elastic peak and is seen as a shoulder in our measurements.</p><p>The second clearly observed in the B0 spectra corresponds to resonant structure for an energy loss of about 2 eV attributable to excitations from just below the Fermi level to unoccupied states at about 1.3 eV above the Fermi level. More detailed analysis of the results are in progress, particularly concerning their polarization dependence.</p><p>[1] Lechermann et al.
