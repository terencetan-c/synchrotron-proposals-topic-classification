<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We had 2 days on the Titan KRIOS to collect data on a functional RNA polymerase transcription termination complex trapped at an intrinsic transcription terminator. We were scheduled in September 2022 and in fact got this session as extra time (26/09 -28/09). Our local contact was Michael Hons. We brought UltrAuFoil gold grids, which were pre-screened on our Glacios microscope. The grids were shipped a week ahead of the scheduled experiment and stored at the ESRF by our local contact. Thanks to the outstanding support by our local contact we were able to select enough squares and holes and collect data that gave us close to 20.000 images over the course of the two days. We had collected on similar RNA polymerase complexes before but needed additional data to trap a different functional state. We brought four grids and our local contact helped us screen those grids and select a suitable one for data collection. He selected all the holes for data acquisition and everything went extremely smooth. We would not have been able to get the quality and size of the dataset without his support.</p><p>The data has been refined to high resolution (~3Ã…) and we could identify several important functional states.</p><p>The data set will be part of a publication we are currently preparing.</p><p>If there is one thing to complain about, we found the new procedure to ship dewars very complicated despite the instructions.</p></div>			</div>
