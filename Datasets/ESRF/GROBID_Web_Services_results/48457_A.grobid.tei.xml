<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The first protein, Cid1, had given hits in our crystallization screens which could be reproduced and optimized. We had tried to freeze these crystals in various cryo-conditions and tested on our home-source many crystals. We could at that time observe diffraction spots until 3.0 angstroms. We hoped that we will observe diffraction spots until at least 2.5 angstroms using the apo form of the enzyme. We actually were even more successful and could record an excellent dataset to 1.95 angstroms resolution. We could finally determine our exact space group which was previously not possible due to bad low resolution completeness. Additionally, we had brought numerous crystals of the enzyme with various substrates and after heavy atom soakings. We could collect several datasets from soaked crystals and with heavy atoms. Unfortunately, the selected heavy atoms do not seem to be present in the crystal which lets us without suitable data for de novo phasing. We are now working on different heavy atoms and on obtaining seleno-methionine containing crystals. Regarding the substrate, we cannot yet assess whether they are bound or not.</p><p>The second protein, Thi5, had been crystallized in numerous conditions giving small and beautiful bi-pyramidal shaped crystals. Attempts to grow larger crystal had been unsuccessful at that time and we decided to start mutating surface residues in an attempt to modify crystal contacts. Since our last visit, we also tested multiple constructs of the Thi5 protein with the goal to induce another crystal form leading to different X-ray diffraction properties. Finally, we could crystallize the thi5 homologue from another fungus. We brought along more than 70 crystals out of which we could tests ~30. We could collect datasets to about 2.75 angstroms from two mutants and from the homologous protein with very reasonable Rfactor, especially for the mutant's one. Each variant has different space group (specifically C2221 and P422) which let us hope that we will be able to solve the structure using the molecular replacement technique (although the sequence identity with the available atomic models is below 30 %...). In addition, we wish to improve the crystal quality for the homologous protein because they showed very weak diffractions to ~3.25 angstroms. Furthermore, several crystals grown in presence of substrate have not been tested due to time limitations.</p><p>In conclusion, these two shifts have allowed us to successfully collect multiple datasets for both projects. Regarding the first project, high resolution datasets (more than 2.0 angstroms) for the apo protein have been collected as well as several others with substrate or productsoaked protein. For the second project, high resolution diffracting crystals have been identified indicating that our strategy consisting of mutating surface residues was the right one to follow. These datasets are good enough that we can start the molecular replacement searches for solving our structures. We have also measured diffraction data some substratesoaked crystals which may or may not contain additional density. Structure determination will first have to be done before we can assess that last point.</p></div>		</body>
