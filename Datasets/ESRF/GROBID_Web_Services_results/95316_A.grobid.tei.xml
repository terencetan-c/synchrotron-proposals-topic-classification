<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Main results: acquisition of low temperature (T-10K) Resonant X-ray scattering (XRS) ptychographic data set in Bragg geometry, for different polarization states. The data set is of good quality to be inverted by the ptychographic algorithm. A preliminary analysis of the data set shows that the magnetic signal is visible.</p><p>(1) Objectives: The aim of experiment HC4336 was exploit the new science opportunities opened up by the initiation of the EBS to develop new 3D Bragg ptychography methods on ID01 to reveal high resolution images of the spin textures formed in technologically relavent spin-coloritronics magnetic materials. The proposal builds on our previous scanning nanobeam magnetic diffraction studies [1] highlighted by ESRF, with the potential to extend Bragg ptychographic imaging to an entirely new user community.</p><p>(2) Challenges: In addition to exploiting the high coherent flux of the ESRF EBS source the experiment set-up presented many challenges that required attention during the experiment:</p><p>(a) A Diamond Phase Plate was required to be set-up to generate both circular and linear incident polarisations onto the sample. We lost 1-2 days of measurement time due to problems with the new ID01 dedicated phase plate set-up. In the end we had to replace this with an older phase plate system borrowed from the XMaS beamline. Its performance was tested and validated. This was vital to the success of our experiment.</p><p>(b) A low vibration He flow Cryostat was also required for our experiment as we were working at 10K. We found that even the very low vibrations was affecting with quality of our data, washing out the speckles obtained. Some times was taken to optimise these conditions with damping the vacuum lines to the pump.</p><p>(c) Scanning of the Fresnel Zone Plate was required for the ptychography data because the use of the cryostat the usual scanning of sample was not possible. Our normal ptychography alogrithms needed to be modified for scanning the beam rather than the sample. This new scheme was tested and validated</p><p>(3) Results:</p><p>Despite the challenges, we magnaged to achieve significant success from the beamtime. Using the scanning diffraction intensities for the different polarisations, magnetic information can be isolated from the circular and pi-incident flipping ratios [1] as shown in figure <ref type="figure">1a&amp;b</ref> below. The results confirm that we have magnetic information in the coherent diffraction intensities. In our previous experiment on ID01 <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> we obtained a beam size resolution of about 500nm. The beam size in our last experiment using the EBS was around 100nm and is fixed by working distance of the FZP to the sample, which is limited by the cryostat. Therefore, ptychography approaches are essential in pushing down the resolution of the experiment Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. The magnetic domain texture as resolved from the flipping ratios of the scanning diffraction maps defined in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. This analyis confirms that the magnetic information is in the coherent diffraction instensties.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(4) Ptychography Analysis</head><p>The experiment was undertaken in June (significantly delayed due to Covid-19 restrictions) and just before summer vacations, which has not allowed significant time to make a thourough analysis of the experimental results. Ptychography reconstructions (amplitude and phase) of the four independent data sets, obtained at circular-left, linear-p, circular-right and linear-s beam polarization states are shown in figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. These four independent data sets lead to reconstructions presenting strong structural likelihood, particularly visible in the phase maps, which contain both crystalline (charge) and magnetic (spin) information. This confirms the quality of the ptychography scan obtained with cryostat and phase plate and new possibilities for the EBS. The pixel size of the reconstruction is 14 nm, while the beam footprint is 140 x 120 nm 2 . Further details of the ptychography reconstructions are shown in figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, which compares the ptychography amplidue reconstructions for left and right circular polarised incident beam. The close simililarity between the two independent data sets demonstrates the robustness of the ptychography analysis and quality of the data obtained using phase plate and cryostat on these magnetic materials using the new EBS. The slight difference in the intensity scale of the resonstructed amplitudes between left and right circular polarised is expected due to the magnetic contrast in the coherent diffracted intensity. left 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 50 100 150 200 250 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 pi 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 50 100 150 200 250 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 right 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 50 100 150 200 250 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 sigma 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 50 100 150 200 250 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 left 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 50 100 150 200 250 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 pi 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 50 100 150 200 250 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 right 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 50 100 150 200 250 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 sigma 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 50 100 150 200 250 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Left Left π π Right Right σ σ Figure 3.

The ptychography reconstructions obtained using 4 different incident polarisations are reproducible and robust enough to retreive the magnetic information. We now understood how to modify the ptychography inversion scheme to take into account the vectorial aspect of the scattered field and this mathematical implementation is in progress. We can then move ahed with publication of the work.</p><p>We now wish to build on these exciting results with continuation experiments on new material systems. Our experimental program has been hindered by the covid-19 pandemic leading to delays in experiments at ESRF. In our next proposals we will focus on two classes of matrials systems the purely antiferromagnetic compound Sr2IrO4 and a new spintronics material Tb3Fe5O12, which has additionally strong magnetostriction effects at low temperature.</p></div>
