Unfortunately, this type of measurement is very sensitive to the stability of the incident X-ray beam, which was not perfect during our measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Since the experiment was conceptually successful, we are presently in the process of checking how much information on short timescales can be extracted from the data after careful normalization, but it might turn out that the instabilities cannot be normalized out, and we might need to repeat our XPCS measurements in the future with a more stable beamline configuration.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

We used our own custom-made cubic sample cell with kapton windows for X-rays and a powerful LED (𝜆=450 nm) from <rs type="funder">ThorLabs</rs>. The perovskite sample was constantly flushed with dry nitrogen to improve the sample stability. To make sure that the structure of the film is not affected by X-rays, we used attenuators, which allowed us to take a series of 900 X-ray diffraction patterns over 1.5 hours without any visible changes in the measured diffraction pattern. We utilized an X-ray beam (<rs type="grantNumber">E=9.94</rs> keV) focused to approximately 2x2 μm 2 and studied the speckle pattern formed around the 001 reflection in Bragg geometry. The speckles arize from segregation of halogene ions caused by light. During the long ilumination period (90 minutes) we observed splitting of the initial 001 diffraction peak into 3 weaker peaks, corresponding to the mixed (<rs type="grantNumber">CH3NH3</rs>)<rs type="grantNumber">PbBr1</rs>.8I1.2 structure and domains with higher concentration of Br -ions, (<rs type="grantNumber">CH3NH3</rs>)PbBr1.8+XI1.2-X, as well as domains with higher concentration of I -ions, (CH3NH3)PbBr1.8-YI1.2+Y (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Careful analysis of the peak positions and the widths will allo us to estimate the ratio of halide ions in all type of domains, as well as estimate the size of these domains. This analysis is presently ongoing. In addition to studing the formation of domains (dynamics), we are using the X-ray photon correlation techniques (XPCS) to study the movement of domains (kinetics). For this, we will correlate the speckle patterns around the 001 diffraction peak at different times, and from the decay of the correlation function</p></div>
