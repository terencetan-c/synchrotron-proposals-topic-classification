<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The hydration of tricalcium silicate (Ca 3 SiO 5 , C 3 S in cement notation) has been investigated in a large number of studies to understand the complex reactions that occur during the hydration of ordinary Portland cement <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The products of reaction between C 3 S and water (hydration) are C-S-H and portlandite (Ca(OH) 2 , CH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>The mechanism of C 3 S hydration is consistently described as a dissolution-precipitation process with precipitation of C-S-H on the surface of C 3 S <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Portlandite, in contrast, is formed in the pore space between C 3 S particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Hydration proceeds in stages with different reaction rates called (pre)induction, main hydration period (consisting of acceleration and deceleration) as well as the steady-state period <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Beyond this definition, there is no general consensus on the mechanisms governing the kinetics. The present work attempts to provide experimental data for these discussions, particularly on the causes of the deceleration period. A general discussion of C 3 S hydration kinetics is not within the scope of this paper but can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. To explain the onset of the deceleration period, a limited diffusion of ions from the C 3 S surface into the aqueous phase due to covering of the interface by growth of C-S-H <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> has been proposed. In addition, a reduction of the C 3 S dissolution rate by consumption of small C 3 S grains <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> that reduces the overall C 3 S reaction rate is discussed as a rate-determining factor during the deceleration period. The main difficulty is the direct experimental observation of C 3 S particles during hydration that are overgrown by C-S-H in the presence of portlandite.</p><p>Gas adsorption measurements are state-of-the-art for the experimental determination of the specific surface area of anhydrous cementitious materials. Alternatively, the surface area of C 3 S can be calculated from the particle size distribution, usually under the assumption that the particles are spheres without consideration of the particle roughness. Laser scattering is commonly applied to determine the particle size distribution of anhydrous cement/C 3 S. Because gas adsorption and laser scattering are not phase selective, neither method can be used to measure the C 3 S specific surface area of hydrated samples because these contain anhydrous and hydrous phases (C 3 S, C-S-H and portlandite).</p><p>Imaging techniques such as electron and X-ray microscopy have high potential in the experimental determination of the particle size distribution and thus the specific surface area of C 3 S during hydration. This is due to the ability of these methods to identify individual particles in the microstructure. High resolution of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can be used to record 3D images of cementitious materials using focussed ion beam serial sectioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The limiting factor is the small size of the analysed volume in the SEM, that is often too small to deduce statistical relevant data for a variety of particle sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. For X-ray microscopy, one can obtain the absorption and phase-contrast images of the sample for larger volumes. The X-rays attenuated by the sample yield the absorption-contrast, whereas the phase shifts between the incident and the transmitted wavefields, due to the X-rays refraction by the sample, generate phase contrast images <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. The absorptioncontrast imaging of the individual phases, present in low-absorbing materials, consisting of atoms with low atomic number is challenging. In this case, phase-contrast imaging can be used to achieve a high compositional contrast within samples consisting of materials with similar linear attenuation coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, this property is only accessible by applying imaging techniques using spatially coherent probe beams, such as 3rd-generation-synchrotron radiation and electron beam or laser, which allows the generation of interference, and by the use of appropriate phase retrieval algorithms.</p><p>For high resolution X-ray imaging (2D and 3D), the high brilliance of synchrotron radiation was shown to be advantageous to study multihierarchical materials like cement pastes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> in scattering experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and spectroscopic investigations, both reviewed elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In Holographic X-ray Computed Tomography (HXCT), the detector is placed at 4 different distances from the sample permitting the detection of both the incident and refracted radiation (near-field inline holography). With this setup, the attenuation and the phase shift can be detected. By varying the sample-detector distance, the phase of the wave field can be determined (phase retrieval) solving a mathematically ill-posed problem. The 3D information (tomography) is obtained by rotating the sample and recording images at a series of projection angles for different sample-detector distances <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Synchrotron based HXCT was used in several studies dealing with cement. These studies, for example, focussed on the impact of organic admixtures (dispersants or (super)plasticizers) on the formation of C-S-H during the hydration of ordinary Portland cement. The pore size distribution in the hardened samples was also analysed <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</p><p>In Near-Field Ptychographic X-ray Computed Tomography (NF-PXCT), X-ray absorption and X-ray phase-contrast imaging of the samples are obtained also in the holographic regime. The near-field ptychographic approach is based on the acquisition of holograms of the sample at different lateral positions within a structured incoming coherent beam to solve the ill-posed problem in phase-retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. With the use of appropriate phase retrieval algorithms, NF-PXCT permits an inherent quantitative 3D imaging of the sample regarding the electron density distribution and by that the mass density at voxel resolution below 20 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. Far-field Ptychographic X-ray Computed Tomography (FF-PXCT) was, for example, used to determine the mass density of different phases in Portland cement pastes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Another study showed the distribution of C 3 S, C-S-H, and portlandite in hardened C 3 S pastes, proving the strength of the method in phase contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>. The microstructure including AFm, AFt, and aluminum hydroxide was analysed by PXCT in ye'elimite containing materials after hydration <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. PXCT experiments were also performed with the aim of determining the mass density and to study the reaction of ye'elimite in-situ <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Finally, the radius of ettringite needles formed during the hydration of C 3 A in the presence of gypsum was investigated by PXCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</p><p>Although the experimental determination of the evolution of the particle size distribution of C 3 S remains a challenging task, hypotheses were proposed to address this important issue. In the first hypothesis, it is assumed that the degree of hydration of the bulk material is equal to that of the median particle size. Based on this assumption, the median particle radius was used to calculate the reacted rim of C 3 S (e), the C-S-H layer thickness (E) and the full particle size (R P , consisting of a C 3 S core overgrown by C-S-H) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> (abbreviations in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The second hypothesis deals with the formation of C-S-H fibres at the surface of C 3 S during the acceleration and deceleration period without assuming a diffusion barrier or impingement ('needle model' <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). Such models may account for a constant C-S-H layer thickness for all particles at a given degree of hydration. The third hypothesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) states that the hydration proceeds faster for small C 3 S particles as a result of an identical reacted rim thickness for all particle sizes. This reacted rim thickness increases with hydration progress ('reaction zone hypothesis') <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The assumption of a constant reacted rim thickness was originally developed for the formation of a C-S-H layer around C 3 S particles and is used here to describe the thickness of the dissolved layer from the C 3 S particles. As a result, smaller particles are fully dissolved earlier than larger particles, and the degree of hydration of the bulk sample is unequally distributed over the different particle size classes. It should be clarified that the first hypothesis mentioned above deals only with the median particle size and not with the full particle size distribution. Furthermore, the calculation of the C 3 S particle size distribution during the main hydration period is in principle possible with the 'needle model'. However, the input parameters need to be changed dramatically and are outside the range of reasonable values when this model is used for the present data. For these reasons, only the 'reaction zone hypothesis' is addressed in this work.</p><p>The first aim of the present work is to fill the mentioned experimental gaps regarding the measurement of the specific surface area of C 3 S during the main hydration period. Therefore, the C 3 S particle size distribution is measured by state-of-the-art 3D X-ray nanoimaging technology, uniquely available in 3rd generation synchrotron facilities such as ESRF including the novel near-field ptychographic X-ray computed tomography (NF-PXCT) and holographic X-ray computed tomography (HXCT). The present work is thus the first application of NF-PXCT for characterization of cementitious samples. The used techniques provide an unprecedented high sensitivity to sample morphology and unprecedented high resolution to study dynamics in cement. Thereby, the particle size distribution data are obtained from the analysis of local distribution of the particle morphology by measuring each particle individually.</p><p>The second aim of the present work is to evaluate the 'reaction zone hypothesis' by simulation of the development of the C 3 S particle size distribution during hydration based on the gathered data. The degree of hydration of C 3 S is needed as an input parameter for this purpose, which is independently analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and thermal analysis (TA). Additionally, the C-S-H layer thickness at the C 3 S surface is evaluated by SEM imaging. The latter approach is complicated by the fact that SEM is a 2D-method which is discussed in Section 3.2. The reliability of the 'reaction zone hypothesis' is explored by comparison of the measured and predicted control parameters: C 3 S particle size distribution and specific surface area of C 3 S. The aqueous phase composition is measured by means of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) during the main hydration period. Combination of the various results allows us to discuss the development of the C 3 S particle size distribution during hydration with additional information on the liquid phase composition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Synthesis of tricalcium silicate</head><p>Tricalcium silicate was produced by high temperature solid state reaction from a blend of calcium carbonate (Merck p.a.) and highly dispersed silicon dioxide (Merck p.a.). The raw materials were homogenized and fired at 1520 • C for 8 h in a platinum crucible and subsequently quenched at 20 • C. This procedure was repeated twice and the material was ground between the high temperature treatments to improve its homogeneity. For high resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography, the volume of the sample has to be very small. To guarantee that a sufficient number of particles are in that volume, the particle size of the C 3 S has to be below 10 μm. For this purpose, the material was ground in batches of 25 g for 20 min in a zirconia disk mill at 700 rpm under the addition of 0.08 g diethylene glycol as a grinding aid. The particle size was further reduced in an air classifier to remove particles larger than 10 μm. The individual batches of C 3 S were finally homogenized. The particle size distribution measured by Laser scattering is provided in the supplementary information (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). These results cannot be directly compared to the particle size distribution obtained by X-ray tomography as both methods are based on different physical methods and use different definitions to extract the particle size from the experimental data.</p><p>The C 3 S produced in this study has the following chemical composition (determined by chemical wet analysis based on titration of calcium, gravimetric determination of silicon and ICP-OES analysis for all other elements): 72.8 wt.-% CaO, 26.1 wt.-% SiO 2 and 1.0 wt.-% LOI, whereas the concentration of foreign oxides was below the limit of detection (0.1 wt.-%). The free lime concentration determined by Franke-method <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> was 0.3 wt.-%. Analysis by QXRD indicated the presence of pure C 3 S in the triclinic modification and the concentration of belite and free lime were below the limit of quantification (LOQ: 5 wt.-% for belite and 0.5 wt.-% for CaO).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Hydration of C 3 S</head><p>All experiments were designed to match the requirements of synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography. As stated before, particle sizes below 10 μm are specifically prepared in order to increase the spatial resolution of the tomography. Therefore, a relatively high water/C 3 S-ratio (by mass) of 3.0 was required to produce a workable suspension as the surface area of the starting material is very high. This water/solid-ratio is higher than normally used for hydration studies on pastes but it was recently confirmed that hydration kinetics of C 3 S are not affected by the water/solid-ratio above 0.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Accordingly, 15 g of C 3 S was mixed with 45 g filtered saturated calcium hydroxide solution and 0.10 g superplasticizer. Superplasticizer (SP1 from reference <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>) was added to the starting solution prior to mixing to avoid the formation of agglomerates due to the surface charge of the C 3 S particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. This superplasticizer is a methacrylic acid-co-polyethylene glycol type polycarboxylate with the following parameters: 8.2 repeating units, 3.9 monomers per repeating unit, 23 monomers in the side chain with a total molecular weight of 10,930 g/mol.</p><p>The closed vessel filled with the suspension was stirred for 24 h at a temperature of 25 • C. Samples (approx. 6 mL suspension) taken after 4, 8, 12, and 16 h of hydration were filtered in a gaseous nitrogen pressure filtration unit using filters with a pore width of 15 nm. This relatively small pore width of the filter was used to avoid C-S-H particles from passing through the filter, especially when superplasticizers are present <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. As a consequence, the filtration process took 30-45 min at a pressure of approx. 2 bar. The solid residue of the filtration was dried at 60 • C for X-ray nano-tomography, QXRD, 29 Si NMR, SEM, and thermal analysis. It was not possible to extract pore solution after 20 and 24 h by this method. Additional samples (&lt; 100 mg) were taken after 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22 h only for thermal analysis by drying at 60 • C without prior filtration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Preparation of the hydrated C 3 S samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM)</head><p>Sample preparation for SEM characterization included embedding of the hydrated samples in epoxy resin and mechanical polishing using diamond slurries of 15, 9, 3, and 1 μm particle size. The polished samples were coated with gold to ensure electric conductivity of the sample surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Preparation of the hydrated C 3 S samples for synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography</head><p>The samples for synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography were produced by embedding the samples in a commercial two-component epoxy resin. Thin filaments composed of epoxy resin and sample material were pulled while the epoxy-C 3 S mix was already stiff but still workable. After hardening of these filaments containing the samples embedded in epoxy resin, these were cut into small segments with a length of 1-2 mm.</p><p>Segments with a diameter of approximately 100 μm were selected under an optical microscope and glued to the sample post of the device by epoxy resin. Thus, the final length of the filaments was approximately 1 mm and the diameter was approximately 100 μm. Only the anhydrous C 3 S was mixed with a highly adsorbing polymer before embedding in resin as described before. This was done to produce an organic film on the surface that enables the observation of individual C 3 S particles instead of agglomerates. For this purpose, 1.00 g C 3 S was mixed with 2.00 g polymer dispersion (styrene-acrylate co-polymer model latex in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, solid content 50%) and treated by ultrasound (frequency: 20 kHz, amplitude 43 mm) for 20 s and quickly dried after 1 min at 50 • C to avoid a reaction with water. A schematic illustration of the sample preparation steps and the nano-tomography as well as simulation is provided in the supplementary information (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). </p></div>

The water content of C-S-H was determined by subtraction of the change in mass related to dehydration of portlandite and the decarbonation of calcium carbonate from the loss on ignition at the final temperature (1000 • C). It was revealed in this calculation that the C-S-H of the hydrated C 3 S sample contains 2.6 mol of water.

The single-pulse experiments used a MAS spinning rate of 4 kHz, a π/2 pulse length of 6.4 μs, 128 scans, and a recycle delay time of 600 s. This recycle delay time is too short for complete relaxation of the silicon sites in C 3 S resulting in an underestimation of the intensity of this phase compared to C-S-H which has a much lower relaxation time. Thus, the intensities extracted from the deconvolution need to be multiplied by a factor of 3.62, which was obtained by comparing a fully relaxed spectrum (recycle delay time 4 h, 24 scans) with a spectrum acquired at the same degree of relaxation (recycle delay time 600 s, 24 scans) as the samples used for quantitative analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Degree of hydration of C 3 S and aqueous phase composition during hydration</head><p>The samples obtained during the hydration experiment were analysed by three independent methods to determine the degree of hydration. These include QXRD, 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis. The degree of hydration is calculated from the evolution of the concentration of tricalcium silicate in the samples when using QXRD and 29 Si NMR. In contrast, the C 3 S concentration is indirectly assessed by thermal analysis by using the determined concentrations of C-S-H and portlandite to stoichiometrically calculate the C 3 S concentration (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)). The concentration of C 3 S during hydration is plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> as the mean value, with the corresponding standard deviation obtained from the individual methods. A method-dependent list of these results is provided in the supplementary information of this article (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). The mean value of the C 3 S concentration against time is fitted using Eq.</p><p>(2):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">C 3 S [wt. -%] = A2 + (A1 -A2) 1 + e t-t0 dt<label>(2)</label></formula><p>A corrected R 2 = 0.99955 was achieved with the fit parameters A1 = 97.6 wt.-%, A2 = 19.5 wt.-%, t0 = 12.9 h and dt =2.1 h. This mathematical fit is also given in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (dotted line). The first derivative of this fit corresponds to the reaction rate and is plotted on the right axis of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The application of reaction calorimetry that is generally used for the determination of the hydration rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was not possible because the hydration was performed in suspensions (water/C 3 S -ratio (by mass) of 3.0) and thus continuous stirring is needed during the measurement.</p><p>As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the concentration of C 3 S at the start of the experiment is slightly lower than 100 wt.-%. This can be the consequence of the adsorption of a small amount of water in the air classifier during milling or other procedures. Between 5 and 20 h, the concentration of C 3 S drops to a final value of 19 wt.-% as it is consumed during the main hydration period. Such a high degree of reaction (0.81) is attributed to the very small particle sizes of the used C 3 S powder. The maximum rate of reaction during the main hydration period is observed after approximately 13 h. This is relatively late when compared to other studies using pure tricalcium silicate and the shift of the maximum of the main hydration peak is connected to the addition of superplasticizer that is known to retard the nucleation and growth of C-S-H. However, the retarding effect is relatively low as the concentration of superplasticizer was only 0.67% (as delivered) relative to C 3 S. Between 20 and 24 h, the concentration of C 3 S decreases from 23 to 19 wt.-%, indicating that the reaction has slowed down and the main hydration period has ended.</p><p>In addition to the C 3 S concentration, the aqueous phase of the C 3 S suspensions during hydration was analysed by ICP-OES (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The results show that the calcium ion concentration is already at a very high level after 4 h hydration (32 mmol/L) and increases after 8 h to 34 mmol/L. At later hydration times, the calcium ion concentration in the aqueous phase decreases, which can be attributed to nucleation and growth of portlandite <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. A calcium ion concentration of 28 mmol/L was observed after 16 h reaction. The silicon concentration displays an opposite trend compared to the calcium ion concentration, decreasing from 20 to 16 μmol/L between 4 and 8 h. A slight increase in silicon is observed after 12 h, followed again by a decrease after 16 h. A possible explanation of the observed trends in the ion concentrations of the aqueous phase can be deduced from the plot of Si against Ca (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7</ref>, supplementary information). In this way the results can be interpreted that the aqueous phase is close to an equilibrium with a metastable C-S-H <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> for hydration periods up to 12 h and departs towards stable C-S-H <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> at later hydration times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">C-S-H layer analysis by means of SEM</head><p>The hydrated samples were investigated by SEM with the aim of evaluating the C 3 S particle size distribution and the C-S-H layer thickness at the surface of the C 3 S particles during hydration. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows examples of these SEM investigations.</p><p>The dark areas in the SEM images shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> represent the epoxy resin, which was used to fix the material. The C 3 S particles are light grey, C-S-H is slightly darker covering the C 3 S surface. Portlandite can be recognised by its shape, i.e., as elongated shapes resulting from sectioned plate-like crystals. Mean values of the C-S-H layer thickness were estimated for a number of 57 (12 h), 77 (16 h), and 70 (20 h) C 3 S particles providing the sum of inner and outer C-S-H. These analyses provide only semi-quantitative information as the polishing process during sample preparation cuts the particles not through the volume centre. An extraction of the true thickness of the C-S-H layer from these results is not straightforward and requires a number of assumptions for particle shape and other properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. It is also complicated by the fact that the C 3 S particles have irregular shapes and there is a high variation in the thickness of the C-S-H layer even at the same grain. Thus, an evaluation of accurate quantitative information is complicated but a semi-quantitative approach demonstrates a growing thickness of the C-S-H layer around tricalcium silicate during hydration as predicted by the reaction zone hypothesis in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Image analysis of the sample hydrated for 12 h shows that the C-S-H covering the C 3 S particles has the lowest thickness of the investigated samples with a value of 300 ± 80 nm. This C-S-H layer thickness increases after 16 h of hydration to a mean value of 670 ± 170 nm and after 20 h of hydration to 800 ± 260 nm. Although these results bear a large error, the conducted SEM investigations prove the findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref> that the C-S-H layer thickness increases with increasing hydration time. The values obtained for the C-S-H layer thickness are much higher than the C-S-H needle length results summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> but in broad agreement with layer thicknesses expected from BNG simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The deviation from values reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> may be due to the fact that the C 3 S used in this study had a higher surface area, which resulted in a higher degree of hydration which facilitates formation of longer C-S-H needles. It was also attempted to extract the particle size distribution of tricalcium silicate from the SEM micrographs. These efforts have indicated that the size of the C 3 S cross sections can be analysed accurately by SEM but a recalculation of the diameter of the 3D-particles from the 2D cross sections is challenging due to irregular shaped alite cores. In addition to C 3 S and C-S-H, also portlandite particles are observed in all samples, especially in the 20 h sample. </p></div>

Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> provides a greyscale image from the HXCT (left hand) together with the processed binary image obtained by the used segmentation algorithm (right hand) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. It can be seen that the used segmentation algorithm showed a good performance in separating neighbouring particles and removing hydration products.</p><p>The image processing from the NF-PXCT experiments is exemplarily shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> for the sample hydrated for 12 h. The C 3 S particles appear in light grey, whereas C-S-H and portlandite are dark grey and the resin still darker. Air bubbles are black spheres. The hydration products C-S-H and portlandite have almost the same grey-level but a different morphology as calcium hydroxide forms elongated particles of several micrometers in the longest dimension. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> shows that the C 3 S particles are clearly identified as their grey level is different from all other phases in the analysed volume. These differences in grey level between C 3 S and the other phases allow an extraction of the particle size distribution of tricalcium silicate. A related analysis of the C-S-H shell thickness is complicated by the fact that the grey levels of C-S-H and portlandite are almost identical. The processed images were segmented to identify the phase present in the individual voxel from the grey level. A minimum of 8 connected voxels representing tricalcium silicate was considered as the smallest particle size which could be identified in the segmentation process. These 8-voxel clusters at an individual voxel size of 50 nm reveal the volume of the smallest particles which is 10 6 nm 3 . The diameter of a sphere with the identical volume is 124 nm. All particle diameters determined from nano-tomography data which are presented in the following sections are calculated as spheres with identical volume compared to the analysed volume of the irregular shaped   particles.</p><p>In the following, the identified C 3 S particles were converted into particle size distributions. The volume distributions of the anhydrous C 3 S particles are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> obtained by HXCT and NF-PXCT.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> shows that NF-PXCT and HXCT give comparable results for the volume-based particle size distribution of the anhydrous C 3 S. The maximum C 3 S particle diameter is 6.3 μm (NF-PXCT) and the smallest measures 124 nm as defined during the post-processing procedure (minimum 8 voxels per particle are selected to avoid any possible contamination of the dataset due to the presence of noise). The HXCT results show some variation in grey level intensity complicating the segmentation process. It appears from the HXCT data that a 7.5 μm particle is present in the analysed volume which is not identified by NF-PXCT. A closer comparison of the tomographic data reveals that such a particle is not present but consists of an agglomeration of two particles in the HXCT reconstruction. This confirms the improved resolution and an enhancement in grey-level contrast of the NF-PXCT results compared to HXCT.</p><p>Results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref> show that the maximum particle size is reduced from 6.3 μm in the anhydrous sample to 5.5 μm (NF-PXCT) or 5.9 μm (HXCT) after 12 h of hydration. The same agreement between NF-PXCT and HXCT is observed for the other samples. The data also reveal a further decrease of the maximum particle size to 5.4 μm (NF-PXCT) or 5.1 μm (HXCT) after 16 h of hydration and the maximum particle size is 4.8 μm (NF-PXCT and HXCT) after 20 h of hydration. This implies that the impact of hydration is clearly visible by a reduced diameter of the largest particles. The situation is different for small particles sizes as the number of particles in a given size class is reduced by dissolution of initially anhydrous particles and increased by size reduction of particles of initially larger particles during hydration. Overall, for the observed hydration periods, both effects lead to steeper and narrower particle size distribution as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>. The qualitative trend to smaller particles sizes during hydration observed for the largest particles is not evident in all size classes for all hydration times. Unexpectedly, the relative concentration of medium sized particles is higher in the 20 h sample than in the 16 h sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>A hydration time dependent particle size distribution measurement during C 3 S hydration with full phase selectivity was achieved in this study by employing synchrotron X-ray nano-tomography. As mentioned in the introduction, this experimental data was unavailable up to now for a description of the C 3 S hydration. The obtained data on the development of the particle size distribution are used to evaluate the 'reaction zone hypothesis'. This hypothesis claims that the hydration proceeds in an identical reacted depth (rim) for all sizes of particles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This reacted rim increases with the degree of hydration. The mathematical expressions are developed in the following equations.</p></div>

After 16 h of hydration, particles smaller than 0.98 μm have completely reacted and after 20 h this value is 1.22 μm. The simulated values for the distribution of the degree of hydration over the initial particle sizes (Fig. <ref type="figure">8A</ref>) correspond at the same time to the reacted rim thickness, which is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8B</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1.">Qualitative evaluation of the simulation</head><p>The qualitative evaluation step regarding the simulation based on the 'reaction zone hypothesis' centres around the comparison of the predicted and measured particle size distribution of C 3 S during hydration. In addition to the particle size distribution of the starting material (measured by NF-PXCT), also the degree of hydration of the samples is taken into account as an input parameter. From this, the volume fractions of C 3 S in the size classes i can be calculated for the hydrated samples. The results of this calculation are compared to the measured values in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>.</p><p>The results from the simulation and nano-tomography are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>. The simulation results are obtained using the particle size distribution from NF-PXCT, degrees of hydration from Section 3.1 and the shrinking core model from Section 4.1. A close agreement between the particle size distributions from simulation and nano-tomography is indicated by the cumulative curves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9A</ref>) and impressively confirmed by the differential curves (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9B</ref>). The error bars in that Figure <ref type="figure">refer</ref> to the standard deviation (1σ) of the NF-PXCT results that was obtained by splitting the analysed volume in three sub-volumes followed by extraction of the particles size distribution for each sub-volume. Thus, the standard deviation is a conservative approximation for the uncertainties introduced by particle statistics.</p><p>It is evident from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9B</ref> that the simulation and the experimental results agree closely and always within the standard deviation. The quality of the results is underpinned by the fact that the curves referring to the individual hydration times are distinct from each other and fall outside the standard deviation from the other hydration times. Only in the late stage of hydration when the reaction slows down, the particles size distributions are located within the standard deviation of the curve from another hydration time (16 h and 20 h samples), see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9B</ref>.</p><p>It is important to point out that the simulation data obtained from the shrinking core model closely agrees with the experimental data thus confirming the validity of that model -at least for the samples analysed in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2.">Quantitative evaluation of the simulation</head><p>The qualitative evaluation of the 'reaction zone hypothesis' shown in Section 4.3.1 is now followed by quantitative tests by analysing the surface area of C 3 S during hydration (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). A comparison of measurements and predictions shows that the surface area of C 3 S decreases during hydration. A close agreement between both nano-tomography techniques and the simulation is observed. The maximum deviation between different techniques was as small as 0.06 m 2 /g (NF-PXCT versus HXCT for the anhydrous C 3 S). This difference is due to difficulties in the segmentation of the HXCT-data of this sample already noted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.

Calculated reacted rim thickness of the C 3 S particles in dependence on the degree of hydration (B). Section 3.3. The absolute differences between the methods are even smaller for all other samples with HXCT tending to give slightly lower values. The good agreement between simulation and experimental data implies that the 'reaction zone hypothesis' can predict the specific surface area of tricalcium silicate during hydration with high accuracy. This statement applies to the samples prepared in this study and a general validation of the model would require a systematic analysis of many other samples.</p><p>The surface area data in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> refers to the outer surface of the particles and may be modified by changes in micro-roughness of the particles during hydration. It has to be kept in mind that the values reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> account for particles larger than 124 nm as smaller particles cannot be detected by the experimental methods used in this study. The presence of smaller particles will lead to higher surface areas and can be included in the simulation. Such particles smaller than 124 nm had to be removed from the present simulation to be consistent with the experimental study. A repetition of the simulation using the particle size distribution from the laser diffraction data would derive surface area data that is systematically higher than the results in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. This difference is due to the fact that laser diffraction can analyse much smaller samples as it operates on a different physical basis. Such data was not included in the current study as it cannot be compared to the experimental results obtained by nano-tomography.</p><p>In view of the quantitative comparison in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, the reaction zone hypothesis enables to simulate the measured (HXCT and NF-PXCT) development of the C 3 S particle sizes during hydration (at least for the samples analysed in this study). Therefore, to predict the surface area of C 3 S during hydration, the starting particle size distribution and the degree of hydration of the bulk sample are sufficient as input parameters for Eqs.

These reported values can be used, for example, as parameters for the simulation of the C 3 S hydration kinetics during the first 24 h of hydration. For this purpose, Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes additionally the values obtained in the current study regarding the aqueous phase composition and related simulated surface area of C 3 S for the samples hydrated for 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 16 h with respect to 1 g alite at 0 h. An integration of our results into kinetic models and the discussion of basic mechanisms for C 3 S hydration in the light of our data is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>The reaction zone hypothesis was applied here for the computation of C 3 S layer dissolved during hydration and showed good agreement with the experimental data for the evolution of the C 3 S particle size distribution during hydration. In addition to this, the reaction zone hypothesis can be applied to the thickness of the C-S-H layer formed around the C 3 S particles during hydration as originally proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. However, the evaluation of such a model would require the extraction of the C-S-H rim thickness from the nano-tomography data which has not been successfully realized. It was also attempted to obtain information on the thickness of the hydrated rim from the SEM data but the uncertainty in the C-S-H shell thickness results obtained by this method was too high. This has prevented an evaluation of the reaction zone hypothesis to the C-S-H layer and such an extension can be the scope of future studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The present study focuses on the measurement of the time-dependent C 3 S particle size distribution during the main hydration period of C 3 S. Since the C 3 S particles are overgrown by C-S-H, phase selective synchrotron radiation nano-tomography was applied for the first time to cementitious materials by combining two different operation modes (HXCT and NF-PXCT). The obtained volume distribution of C 3 S particles shows good accordance between HXCT and NF-PXCT results. The experimental data indicate that the C 3 S particles sizes decrease during hydration, which leads to a decrease of the specific surface area of C 3 S due to the consumption of small particles.</p><p>The obtained experimental results are used to simulate the process of C 3 S dissolution during hydration using a constant reacted rim thickness for all C 3 S particle sizes that varies with the degree of hydration ('reaction zone hypothesis' <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>). For this purpose, the degree of hydration of the bulk samples and the C 3 S particle size distribution of the starting material are used as input parameters for these simulations. The degree of hydration during the first 20 h of hydration was independently determined by means of QXRD, 29 Si MAS NMR, and TA with consistent results. The simulation of the C 3 S particle size distribution based on the "reaction zone hypothesis" showed good agreement with the measured values by HXCT and NF-PXCT for our samples. It has to be noted that only particles bigger than 124 nm in diameter are investigated and compared to calculated values. Thus, the 'reaction zone hypothesis' appears to be an adequate description of the development of the particle size distribution of C 3 S during hydration. 3 4 5 6 7 8 . l o V [ n p o i t u b i r t s i d e v i t a l u m u c -% ] parƟcle diameter [μm] 0h NF-PXCT 12h NF-PXCT 16h NF-PXCT 20h NF-PXCT 12h Simu 16h Simu 20h Simu 0h HXCT 12h HXCT 16h HXCT 20h HXCT 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 . l o V [ n o i t u b i r t s i d e v i t a v i r e d -% ] parƟcle diameter [μm] 0h NF-PXCT 12h NF-PXCT 16h NF-PXCT 20h NF-PXCT 12h Simu 16h Simu 20h Simu 0h HXCT 12h HXCT 16h HXCT 20h HXCT B) </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
