<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was performed only two months ago. Since the data analysis for this type of experiment usually takes rather long, we cannot yet make definitive statements. Therefore, this report naturally contains preliminary results and conclusions.</p><p>The analysis is still underway. At this point, we can say the following.</p><p>1) As proposed, we studied crystalline thin films of the organic semiconductor diindenoperylene (DIP), which had recently identified, in collaboration with the ESRF, as a very suitable model system for this class of materials (A. C. DÃ¼rr, F. Schreiber, K. A. Ritley, V. Kruppa, J. Krug, H. Dosch, and B. Struth, Phys. Rev. <ref type="bibr">Lett. 90 (2003)</ref> 016104).</p><p>2) The diindenoperylene films proved to be as high-quality as shown in our previous experiments, as demonstrated by very narrow (0.01 deg) rocking widths and a large number (up to 10) Bragg reflections along the specular path.</p><p>3) The data on the specular path could be taken with very good resolution as a function of time and temperature. 4) Data of the diffuse reflectivity (mostly in the longitudinal direction, i.e. q_x) could be taken with high quality, again as a function of time and temperature.</p><p>5) The grazing-incidence data turned out to be less high-quality due to the limited coherence length of the film structure in the plane. This effect was to be expected for the system under study. 6) The interdiffusion studies were performed as a function of time and temperature. We are optimistic that the data will yield the desired information about the interdiffusion mechanism.</p><p>While we consider the beamtime successful, we wish to point out that experiments on new materials such as in the present case with a certain amount of preparative work on the site are fairly demanding and time-consuming.</p><p>We wish to acknowledge the excellent experimental conditions, the stability of the beam and the reliability of the beamline as well as the support by the local contact.</p><p>We are presently in the process of analysing the data, which we feel are of sufficient quality to warrant publication.</p></div>		</body>
