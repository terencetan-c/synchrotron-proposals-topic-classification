<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Structural characterisation of oxidoreductases dependent on flavin cofactors Experiment number: 16-01 -762 Beamline: BM16 Date of experiment: from: 2nd to: 3rd September Date of report: 3-11-2010 Shifts: 3 Local contact(s): Mickael Cherrier Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Ramón Hurtado-Guerrero Marta Martínez Julvéz University of Zaragoza BIFI -Edificio I + D Report:</p><p>-Ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase (Fpr/FNR) from Xanthomonas axonopodis: we managed to get the structure at home by molecular replacement. At the end phasing was not necessary and we only need to grow better crystals. We took some of the crystals to the ESRF and we managed to get better resolution, 1.5 A. At the moment we are carrying out kinetic data to complement the structure and hopefully publish the data. -Ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase (FNR) from pea: We managed to get a good diffraction for one of the mutants, L268V (involved in binding to the flavin cofactor). The rest of the mutants diffracted very bad (4 A or higher). We also took other type of mutants of FNR from Anabaena, S59A (mutant involved in the transfer of electrons in this type of proteins). We had very good diffraction from this crystal, 1.5 A. Both of these two proteins have been solved by molecular replacement. -Flavodoxin with complex C4: We also get the structure of this protein but unfortunately we did not have the inhibitor (C4). We are trying at the moment soaking experiments with this compound. The rest of the compounds cocrystallised with this protein showed twinning and we could not index them. -New protein that we managed to get crystals while they initially cancelled our first trip (first trip was at the end of July) due to problems with the beamline. This is a glycosyltransferase from which I am trying to apply for ID23-1 at the moment. This enzyme is involved in glycosylation of proteins such as trombospondin and would be a new crystal structure. For this reason I did some work in BM16 with these initial crystals soaked with different heavy atoms. I did not see any anomalous signal with any of these trials, and this is why I need to apply again to the ESRF for a tuneable beamline. Because I have tried so far around 35 different heavy atom soaks, I would like to carry out UV-RIP experiments in ID23-1.</p><p>The trip to BM16 was good because we managed to get better resolution for a new protein and also the structures of two different mutants. At the moment I need to use tuneable beamline to be able to solve the glycosyltransferase I mentioned above.</p></div>		</body>
