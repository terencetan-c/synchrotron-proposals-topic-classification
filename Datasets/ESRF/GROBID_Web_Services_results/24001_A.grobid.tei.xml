Nevertheless 25% of patients have a relapse after the first treatment, leaving only bone marrow transplantation as an option, although only for the younger relapsed patients. For relapsing patients a new drug is tested, injectable solubilised arsenic trioxyde. We used the microbeam synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence (µ-SXRF) technique to characterize he Arsenic content of hair after the therapy. The measurements were carried out on beamline ID22. Three kinds of measurement were performed.</p><p>By measuring As content along hair length we can achieve a kinetic study to monitor the arsenic content in patient's hairs. Taking into account a mean hair growth rate of 350 µm per day, the 100 µm step used for sampling corresponds to ca 7 h of hair growth. We observe a sharp  Transversal human hair sections (20 micrometer thick) deposited on 4 µm polycarbonate films were analysed. Micro-XRF mapping were performed using a monochromatic beam of energy 14 keV using the Si[111] double crystal monochromator. The beam was focused to 1x3µm 2 with the Kirkpatrick Baez double mirror devices, which deliver 2.0E+11 ph/s at 14 keV. Stepsize was 1*3 µm 2 . X-ray fluorescence spectra were collected with a Si(Li) detector. It appears that the arsenic is concentrated at the exterior part of the cortex, just under the cuticle, in a region believed to have lower cystine content than the main cortex (Figure 2). As chemical speciation was investigated locally from µ-XRF maps by scanning As absorption K-edge (11.863 keV) with energy step of 0.4 eV. Few scans collected in the fluorescence mode were averaged in order to improve the statistic. Micro-XANES spectra recorded at the points of hair with high arsenic content, shows that arsenic is at the As(III) oxidation state, i.e. as administered and not oxidised to As(V) as the metabolites found in urine, suggesting the incorporation of As in hair occurs before oxidation, in accordance to the kinetic observation about rapid incorporation after injection. Furthermore, the XANES spectra correspond to an oxygen type (N and/or O) and not sulphur environment, suggesting arsenic is not linked to the keratin cysteine residues, corroborating the 2D cartography results.

It is noteworthy that therapy interruptions are very well reflected to arsenic hair content as seen in figure1. The results show three successive cycles of increased arsenic content, separated by two periods of lower, although higher than normal, level. The total hair length between the first rise and last fall of arsenic level is ca 2 cm, corresponding to an 8 week treatment. This pattern is in accordance with the clinical background of this patient, which has received an As therapy for 40 non-continuous days in a period of two months.</figDesc></figure>
