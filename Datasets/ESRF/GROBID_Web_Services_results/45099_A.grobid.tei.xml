<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>High temperature fuel cells are promising systems to electrochemically generate electricity and heat for stationary applications. Fuel cells provide many advantages over traditional energy conversion systems including high efficiency, reliability, modularity, fuel adaptability and very low levels of polluting emissions. Among them, the most mature device is the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) which essentially consists in two porous electrodes separated by a fully dense oxide-ion conducting electrolyte (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). The operating principle of such a cell is illustrated in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Oxygen supplied at the cathode side of the cell reacts with incoming electrons from the external circuit to form oxide ions, which migrate to the anode through the electrolyte. At the anode side, oxide ions combine with hydrogen in the fuel to form water, liberating electrons. Electrons flow from the anode through the external circuit to the cathode. Nevertheless, SOFCs are in a very early stage of their commercialization due to several technical drawbacks caused by the high operating temperature (generally &gt; 900 °C) imposes by the electrolyte. La tely, different approaches have been developed in order to decrease the SOFC's operating temperature. One of them is the development of the Proton Conducting Fuel Cell (PCFC), a concept based on new type of charge carriers (H + instead of O 2-) (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). Since protons conduction requires lower energy than oxygen ions, this type of fuel cell is able to operate at lower temperatures, typically in the range 500-700 °C. However, both concepts present limitations related to the concepts themselves. In the case of SOFCs, water formation occurs at the anode side which is responsible for fuel (hydrogen) dilution and then decreases the activity of the electrocatalytic sites where hydrogen oxidation takes place. On the other hand, in PCFCs, water is formed at the cathode side which not only decreases electrocatalytic activity but most of all creates a highly corrosive mixture of water, oxygen and high temperature which is very demanding for the materials. In order to overcome limitations of the two already existing systems, a new concept of fuel cell has been proposed by the Centre des Matériaux of Mines ParisTech. This one (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>) consists in joining the anode side of a PCFC (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>) and the cathode side of a SOFC (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) through a central membrane (CM). Therefore, protons are created at the PCFC anode and are diffused through the electrolyte towards the CM while oxygen ions are created in the SOFC cathode and also diffused through an electrolyte towards the CM. Then, protons and anions combine to form water which is eliminated. This new concept of fuel cell is being developed by a European research consortium constituted by 9 partners both academic and industrial coming from five different European countries <ref type="bibr">(France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Bulgaria)</ref>. This project was financed by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Programme -theme Energy <ref type="bibr">(FET, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr">(FET, -2011))</ref>. The concept has been patented by the consortium leader.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. CM prerequisites</head><p>The CM of IDEAL-Cell is the core and critical element of the concept and then the truly innovative step in this fuel cell concept. It is a porous medium made of both the anion (ACP; YDC15) and the proton (PCP; BCY15) conducting phases. As the reaction of water formation (recombination of H</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">+ and O 2- (a) (b) (c)</formula><p>ions) takes place within the CM, its composition and morphology must be optimized for this basic purpose. As the proton conductivity in the PCP is expected to be much higher than the oxygen conductivity in the ACP at a given temperature, so that the optimized composition is not a priori the one for which the two active phases are in the same volume proportion. The volume fraction of both ACP and PCP is a parameter to considered since it offers an efficient lever to tailor the location where the reaction for water formation will take place in the CM; it is thought that the delocalization of this reaction toward the ACP electrolyte should allow giving room to integrating a channel pattern toward the PCP in view of an efficient water evacuation.</p><p>Moreover, all morphological parameters such as porosity and particle size and shape, tortuosity, percolation and permeability will influence the charge transport carrier and the water flow within the CM. There must be morphological sites where the three phases meet and in which ACP and PCP percolate towards their respective electrolytes, and porosity must percolate towards the outside of the cell (figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). However, the percolation of the TPBs is not requisite, which strongly releases the percolation conditions that prevail for the electrochemical reactions taking place in SOFC and PCFC electrodes. As the volume density of TPBs has a straightforward impact on the number of reactional sites where the water formation occurs, the more TPBs, the more the local volume-specific reaction rate and the more the exchange current density within the CM.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Scheme of the ionic and porosity percolation pathways within the CM.</p><p>In our case, two major aspects have to be considered about the design of the CM: (i) the reactive volume, represented by the TPBs must be extended to its whole volume and (ii) an effective evacuation of water must be ensured. Effective water evacuation will depend on the pores size and their tortuosity and percolation inside the CM. In fact, high porosity may not be enough for the CM's efficient performance if pores do not percolate in order to create pathways that allow water evacuation from the bulk towards the exterior. Moreover, water evacuation might be limited if tortuosity of pathways is far from unity, generating highly curve porosity wherein water can condense. A quantitative analysis of back-scattered scanning electron microscopy (BS-SEM) cross section image was carried out but it doesn't give useful information about the interconnected pore network (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>).</p><p>Pores that may seem closed in the 2D image can actually percolate thorough the missing dimension on the image. Therefore, knowledge of the real 3D morphology of the CM is of primary importance to model the fluid's flow and the membrane's electrical properties and consequently optimize its performance based on its microstructure and shaping process parameters.</p><p>For these reasons, we propose to use the ESRF facilities to carry out the 3D characterization of this CM microstructure by X-ray microtomographies. These experiments were carried out according to two session, first to study the reactive volume in the CM where the electrochemical reaction of ions recombination takes place to form water (17 th -18 th July, 2009) and second to explore channed structures for an effective evacuation of this latter (19 th -21 st October, 2010). III. Results from the first session: 17 th -18 th July, 2009 III.1. CM sample preparation</p><p>In order to study in 3D the morphological parameters (porosity size and shape, porosity, percolation…) that were identified by modelling as having strong influence on the electrical efficiency of the IDEAL-Cell, a set of CMs were produced for microtomography experiment, varying:</p><p>-The volume fraction of porosity: figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> clearly shows that this parameter can be easily controlled through an appropriate quantity of pore former. 3 amounts, 40%, 50% and 60%, were chosen in the present study; -The nature of the pore formers (figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>), poly-vinyl-butyral (PVB), graphite and corn starch in order to control the pore shape and size after sintering (figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>); -The volume ratio between the proton conducting (PCP, BCY15) and the anion conducting (ACP, YDC15) phases: 40/60, 50/50 and 60/40 ratios were selected here. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> displays micrographs of the powders used to design the pore within CM. Obviously, subsequent to sintering, the size and morphology of the residual pores will be directly related to the nature of the pore former used. As an illustration, an aggregated and almost spherical particles containing powder (corn starch; figure <ref type="figure">5c</ref>) gives rise to sphere-shaped pores as observed in figure <ref type="figure">6c</ref>. These single-layered CM were then characterized by X-ray microtomography at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at Grenoble, France (July 17 th and 18 th , 2009). Experiments were carried out on the beamline N°19 dedicated to "microtomography and phase contrast" requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III.2. Experimental conditions III.2.1. Microtomography</head><p>The principle of microtomography is very similar to that of the well-known medical scanner. It consists in recording a series of radiographs at different angular positions of the sample, which rotates around an axis perpendicular to the highly energetic X-ray beam. The best images, in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and quantitative exploitation, are obtained when a synchrotron radiation is used under high intensity, practically parallel and monochromatic incoming beam conditions. The range of pixel sizes available at ESRF goes from 0.30 to 30 µm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III.2.2. Phase contrast imaging</head><p>The X-ray beams produced at third generation synchrotron radiation facilities exhibit a high degree of coherence that allows recording "phase images" by varying the sample-to-detector distance. An increased sensitivity is provided that allows identifying materials with neighbouring densities (for example Al and Si, and in our case BCY15 and YDC15).</p><p>A significant number of samples were tested (27 CMs gathering 3 volume fractions of porosity, 3 compositions [ratio PCP/ACP] and 3 different pores formers); the best possible results at the highest spatial resolution that the technique could allow were obtained. 1200 tilt series were obtained for each sample, which will allow easily reconstructing the whole volume (an example is given in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>).</p><p>The best recording parameters are dependant on the:</p><p>-Nature of the sample holder; -Incident beam energy that allowed reducing background noise to signal ratio keeping the contrast between the three BCY15, YDC15 and porosity phases; -Signal acquisition time.</p><p>The best conditions which were retained were:</p><p>-The sample was pressed between the chaps of a stainless steel sample holder (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8c</ref>) to eliminate vibration; -Distance between the camera and the sample: 10 mm; -Incidence beam energy: attempts were made using also energies of 30.0, 38.0, 40.0 keV in order to maximize the contrast between both BCY15 and YDC15 phases and to reduce the noise to signal ratio. The best compromise was 22.5 keV; -Total recording time was 1 hour per central membrane sample.</p><p>(a) (b) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III.2.3. Reasons which justified the choice of experimental conditions</head><p>Through previous scanning electron microscope analyses (figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>), pore sizes between 1.0 and 15 µm were estimated. Therefore a resolution of 0.28 µm pixel -1 was required, which imposed the use of samples with 300 µm × 300 µm cross sections (whatever the length). As samples of the CM are highly porous (&gt; 40% of relative porosity), hence easily breakable, tape casted and sintered layers were first impregnated with an epoxy resin and carved in fine slices having the dimensions mentioned above.</p><p>The first sample was prepared by putting down its tip on a stainless steel support (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8a</ref>), whose surface was made sticky by means of resin (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8b</ref>). Nevertheless, the 2D images recorded were blurred because of vibration of the sample originating from the degradation of the resin under the highly energetic X-ray beam. A stainless steel sample holder was then selected successfully for all experiments insofar as high quality images were recorded. The beam energy (22.5 keV) was chosen so that the two materials present the highest difference in Xray absorption with the lowest possible background noise (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>). (a) (b) (c) (a) (b) (c) III.3. Image processing III.3.1. Image segmentation</p><p>After a first analysis of the images obtained at ESRF, it was decided not to work with the samples for which Poly-Vinyl Butyral was used as a pore former because the pores were too small for an accurate segmentation of 2D images. In the end, data for ten samples were used, five with corn starch and five with graphite as pore formers. Each of the phases (BCY15, YDC15 and porosity [replaced by the epoxy resin for the experiments]) had different X-ray linear absorption coefficients and therefore each of them presented different grey levels that allowed their segmentation by applying the correct threshold.</p><p>As it had been expected from the absorption coefficient data (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>), the proton conducting phase (PCP; BCY15) is brighter than the anion conducting phase (ACP; YDC15). Porosity was filled with an epoxy resin and appears black in the images. After obtaining the first segmentation (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">10</ref>), it appeared that at the interface between the pores and the brighter phase, voxels with an intermediate grey level were detected and then attributed to the anion conducting phase (YDC15). This effect created a fake ring around the brighter phase wherever it was in contact with a pore, as one can see in figures 10a and 10b. The presence of this ring was keeping the proton conducting phase from percolating in the first measurements that were made. A sequence of image processing operations was determined in order to eliminate this artefact. The final result is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11c</ref>, and as it can be seen the interfaces are noisy and unrealistic due to the former operations. A new sequence of image treatment operations was determined to smooth the surfaces. Each one of the phases was then properly obtained and to each one of them a grey level was attributed (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">11d</ref>). (a)</p><p>(b) (c) (d)  The detection of the active TPBs required to identify:</p><p>-The voxels of proton conducting phase (PCP; BCY15) connected to the anode; -The voxels of the anion conducting phase (ACP; YDC15) connected to the cathode; -The voxels of porosity (epoxy resin) connected to the exterior of the central membrane.</p><p>These voxels will be the ones reached by a geodesic propagation coming from the surface to which they must be connected. For example all the voxels of the proton conducting phase reached by a geodesic propagation coming from the anode are considered to be connected to it through a path in that phase. The intersection of the three phases gives the segments where the three phases are in contact and each of them percolates to the anode, cathode or exterior of the cell. If we intersect these segments with all the TPBs previously identified, we obtain the active TPBs. The percentage of active TPBs and their length was determined for all of the samples (table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). . Therefore the first results obtained here on non-optimized microstructures can be considered as realistic 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III.3.3. Phase percolation and tortuosity</head><p>After extraction of the three phases and triple phase boundaries, percolation rates and tortuosities were determined in the x, y and z direction for each one of the phases. The algorithm implemented to determine percolation applies geodesic propagations into the studied media along the forward and backward directions using a sphere as a structural element. Only the paths that reach the opposite face of the volume in both directions are extracted. For each one of the voxels belonging to the percolating pathways, tortuosity is determined as the ratio of the geodesic distance of the path connecting two opposite faces that passes through that voxel, to the Euclidean distance between the two surfaces (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">13</ref>). Therefore we obtain not a single value of the tortuosity for a porous structure but an histogram of tortuosities for the voxels that belong to a percolating path. In figures 14 and 15 are shown two examples out of the ten samples that were analysed. Through the results one can conclude that for both types of samples we obtain very high percolating ratios -always above 93% -for the three phases. The percolating paths created are very straight for the solid and gas phases with tortuosities close to one,which means that the path length is very close to the Euclidean distance which is very suitable for charge and mass transportation in the central membrane. On the other hand triple phase boundaries segments have a rather high tortuosity of about 2.5, which indicates that they are far from being straight; this is totally appropriate for an increased length of active TPBs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III.3.4. Prediction of the effective properties of the CM</head><p>The Centre de Morphologie Mathématique (CMM) of Mines ParisTech developed a software that allows to predict the physical properties of materials from images of their microstructure. It is based on the 3D computation of fields from 3D images, based on iterations of fast fourier transforms (FFT). On the occasion of the IDEAL-Cell project, it is therefore possible to give the following estimations for which preliminary results were obtained:</p><p>-3D prediction of the Darcy's permeability tensor by FFT resolution of the Stokes equations; -Conductivities (anionic and protonic).</p><p>A first estimation of the Darcy permeability for water of the sample represented in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref> was obtained in one direction of propagation of the fluid (Ox). Other directions should be considered, to account for the anisotropy of the porous medium. The estimated permeability gives k = 1.35×10 -10</p><p>, for a length in cm. This is similar to the permeability of sandstone (in the range 10 -10 -10 -11</p><p>). Similarly, a first estimation of the effective bulk conductivity of each component was obtained for samples C and I, and are given in table 2. They are obtained for the propagation of current in the same direction as for the flow of water. In this table, we give a relative effective conductivity,that must be multiplied by the absolute conductivity of the corresponding component.  In a next step, further points will be developed:</p><p>-Estimation of the full tensor of permeability and conductivity; -Estimation of the representative volume element (RVE) for each property; -Validation of the results by comparison with available data, for the input of properties in the macroscopic models.</p><p>Finally, after calibration, it will be possible to use this approach for application to simulations of models of random microstructures, in order to optimise the effective properties with respect to the end properties of the IDEAL-Cell. IV. Results from the second session: 19 th -21 st October, 2010</p><p>In order to go further in the optimisation of the CM microstructure and especially to make water evacuation more efficient, a 3D cross-linked channelled architecture has been considered (using polymeric meshes) along with the existent already optimized microporosity, dispersed in the whole ceramic volume and generated by adding pore formers (see part III). These sophisticated samples, were prepared by dip coating and tape casting. The single-layered channelled CMs were then subjected to X-ray microtomography analyses at the ESRF in Grenoble, France (October, 19 th -21 st October, 2010). Experiments were carried out on the high-resolution diffraction topography beamline (ID19) dedicated to "microtomography and phase contrast" requirements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV.1. Channeled CM sample preparation</head><p>A significant number of samples were scanned and are listed below:</p><p>-40 single layer CMs prepared by dip coating including 5 different meshes from SEFAR and 3 different pore formers; -18 single layer CMs produced by tape casting gathering 5 volume fraction of porosity, 3 compositions (different ratio between BCY15 and YDC15 active phases), 3 different pore formers and 6 thread mesh diameters; -6 "monolithic" CMs (as references), produced by tape casting, and containing only BCY15 with varying "standard" and channelled porosity. These samples were studied with the aim at integrating them into a monolithic IDEAL-Cell concept in which TPB segments are replaced by TPB suface (significant increases of active sites, decreases of polarization resistance…) as only one phase consitutes the CM.</p><p>(d) (e) (b) (c) (a) IV.1.1. Channeled CM prepared by dip coating</p><p>First dip coating experiments to fabricate CM samples with channelled microstructures were performed with the aim at ensuring an effective evacuation of water produced. A novel, simple and cost effective method was recently reported by J.C. Ruiz-Morales et al.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>, based on dip coating for the creation of a 2D/3D matrix of cross-linked channels through SOFC electrode materials. This method was adapted here to produce IDEAL-Cell CM samples with optimized microstructure, in favour of water removal, by means of successive optimization of operating conditions. The experiment consists in dipping a polymeric net (PET-based mesh) in a freshly prepared slurry made of the oxide powder(s) and organic additives. In most cases, one single immersion is sufficient to get complete coating of the polymer fabric. After drying at room temperature (RT) the coated net can be easily shaped into any geometry, cut out (as a disk, square base parallelepiped, etc…), bent or rolled. The final step is a slow firing process, which helps removing all organic materials producing the desired porous channels. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">16</ref>, the sketch of the experiment is reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 16. Sketch of dip coating experiment showing the succession of processes.</head><p>Obviously, the idea consists in implementing a cylinder-shaped channel network into the optimzed porous microstructure (high density of TPBs, percolating phases…) of the CMs; the use of pore formers (commercial starch or graphite) is then still relevant to create the porous matrix. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref> and figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">17</ref> report details (including grain shape and size) about the different pore formers used. As starting composition, a slurry based on the mixture of 50% BCY15 and 50% YDC15 in volume was prepared. With a view of simplifying shaping process for fabrication of IDEAL-Cell (avoiding composition variation from one layer to the other) while increasing its electrochemical performances, the use of the BCY15 material only was considered. Indeed, it has been demonstrated, in the frame of our research that BCY15 exhibits both anionic and protonic conductivities, that tend to equalize at 600 °C; then, it appears judicious to totally replace Y DC15 by BCY15 to form the BCY15 / CM-BCY15 / BCY15 succession of layers. Therefore, BCY15 based slurries were also prepared. In order to obtain stable slurries leading to a green layer with good rheological properties after dip coating, some additives must be added and mixed together with powders: as solvent, a mixture of methyl-ethyl-ketone and ethanol (3/2 w/w) was used while the dispersion is assumed by the addition of mono and di-phosphate esters (MONOFAX 057). Polyethylen glycol (PEG 400) and polyvinyl butyral (PVB) were finally added as plasticizer and binder respectively. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">4</ref> report the detailed composition of the slurry. After each component addition, the slurry was thoroughly ball milled in a PET bottle with small zirconia balls for 2 hours. After separating out the balls of the mixture by filtration, the slurry is ready for coating. Ball milling for 2 hours after the addition of each component</p><p>Obviously, the thickness of the prepared samples (mesh + slurry) is driven by the mesh thickness. Therefore, the use of thicker polymeric nets will lead to thick central membranes. In order to explore different central membrane samples, in terms of thickness and micro-channels diameter, five types of commercial nets were used, the diameter of channels being imposed by the thread diameter of meshes (table 5 and figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">18</ref>).</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. Characteristics of the nets from SEFAR. After dip coating of polymeric nets into the slurry, green samples were dried in air for 2 hours and then sintered with the following cycle: 400 °C for 4 hou rs with a 1 °C min -1 heating rate (to slowly remove organic additives and eventually starch), 650 °C fo r 2 hours keeping the previous heating rate (to oxidize graphite when present, otherwise skipped), 1250 °C for 5 hours reached with a 2 °C min -1 heating rate (sintering step), and cooling down to room temperature at 3 °C min -1</p><p>. Altogether, 40 samples (3 × 3 cm 2 and variable thicknesses) were prepared whose composition are reported in table 6. For ESRF experiments, dedicated 3 × 3 cm 2 samples are needed and were cut to appropriate sizes (parallelepiped with a square base of 300 × 300 µm 2 ) with the following procedure:</p><p>-embedding in epoxy resin; -slicing by a diamond saw of 0.2-0.3 mm cuts; -manual removing of resin by using an hot cutter blade.</p></div>

The procedure of resin extraction is schematized in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">19</ref> below.  Perfectly flat samples, without any observable cracks on the surface, were obtained (see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">20</ref>); thickness was quite homogeneous along the samples and strongly dependent on the mesh and slurry viscosity used. The diameter of channels formed during sintering exhibits a shrinkage of about 20% with respect to the initial thread diameter. In addition to channels, micro porosity is also distributed in the whole volume of the CM. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">21</ref>, the images recorded by SEM clearly show the effect of the nature of the pore formers on the resultant microstructure of the central membrane. In particular, the effect of graphite SFG75, graphite KS6 and starch is compared with the case where no pore former was added to the ceramic based slurry. This aspect is of particular importance because it could contribute significantly to the process of water evacuation. From EDS spectra, recorded on different zone of the samples (appearing in pink inserts, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">21</ref>), no composition variation has been detected.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV.1.2.

As expected by the absorption coefficient data (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>), the proton conducting phase (PCP; BCY15) appears brighter than the anion conducting phase (ACP; YDC15) in the images (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">23a</ref>). As for porosity that was filled with an epoxy resin, it appears black in the images. Therefore, the three phases can be identified by their different grey level. Regarding the histogram in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">23b</ref>, displaying the grey level distribution in frequency, it becomes apparent that porosity (in black; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">23a</ref>) and the ceramic materials (brighter in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_22">23a</ref>) can be easily separated in the images: indeed, the two peaks are not convoluted. The porosity is systematically identified using an iterative algorythm 3</p><p>. Nevertheless, and we did not expect this difficulty to happen, there is only one local maxima for both YDC15 and BCY15, making their segmentation impossible from image analyses. Moreover, an enlarged zone of an image (CM fabricated by dip coating; figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">24a</ref>) shows that the transition between the three phases is in the range of the image resolution (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_23">24b</ref>). Insofar as phases proportion is very sensitive to the threshold position, the latter being limited by the resolution, the separation might be possible but will be error-prone. To counter act this difficulty, the idea consists in determining the grey level distribution characteristic of each material. Indeed, the grey level of each pixel in the image will allow for identifying to which material it corresponds. In other word, a phase map in grey level should be extracted from each image so that the correct proportion of BCY15 and YDC15 must be obtained. Knowing the grey level histogram of a BCY15 sample and the one of a composite central membrane, which composition is well-known, it is possible to extract the histogram of a pure YDC15 sample (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">25</ref>). Indeed, the composite histogram is built up from the convolution of x% YDC15 and (1-x)% BCY15; as the histogram of pure BCY15 is accurately determined, the YDC15 one can be easily extracted (light grey line in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_24">25</ref>) knowing the value x. On the one hand, thanks to this protocol, each pixel can be attributed to a phase according to its grey level, and the intersection between the YDC15 and BCY15 distributions corresponds to the uncertainty of the method. On the other hand, the threshold that defines the proportion of the two materials, the latter being known, can be changed iteratively until the experimental values are achieved. This latter operation was carried out to extract results from images recorded during the first ESRF session. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. Futur activities</head><p>As porosity percolation pathway and tortuosity are directly extracted from the 3D image analyses, these morphological parameters can be used to compare the ability of different microstructures to deal with flow and evacuation of water vapour in and out of the CM respectively. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations can be carried out in a representative volume element (RVE) whose the size is representative of the whole volume of the porous CM. VREs can be meshed and the calculations are performed using finite element method. This latter will be performed by introducing a peak of water vapour concentration C o at t = to and then calculating the distribution concentration C out after it driving through the porous CM (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_25">26</ref>); obviously, C out will be closely dependant on the sample morphology in terms of tortuosity and percolation pathway. An estimation of 3D key parameters (free active surfaces, 3D tortuosity of pores or mixed conducting phases…) can be made on available 3D micrographs or on 3D simulations of microstructures, hence the prediction of the effective properties (Darcy permeability, effective anionic and protonic conductivities) via the implementation of the Morph-Hom code available at CMM of Mines ParisTech.</p><p>In the case of simulated images, an optimization of the microstructure with respect to effective properties will be looked for, from a systematic exploration of the models parameters. On this basis, the potentialities of the novel components microstructure will be quantitatively known, and the most promising ones will be checked experimentally by back and forth between modelling and experimental results. In addition, numerical extraction of TPB segments from reconstruction of 3D X-ray microtomography images will be performed (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">27a</ref>). The mirror 3D image of the active phases (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">27a</ref>) displays the porous volume (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">27b</ref>) in which circulation of water vapour can be modelled (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_26">27c</ref>) using the CFD code of COMSOL.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
