<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Allocated beamtime was used as followed: 2 hours for preparing grid atlases, 3 hours for grid screening and selecting the best grid, the remaining time was used for data collection. There were network problems at the facility, so the start of the data collection was postponed for a couple of hours, but the session was extended in order to compensate for the lost time. As a result, we were able to collect a dataset of 6278 movies for a large complex formed by the intermediate filament protein.</p><p>In total 7 grids with frozen sample were loaded into the microscope. However only grids #2 and #5 were showing good ice quality and decent particle distribution. In total 21 grid squares were selected on grid#2. Examples of a good grid square and a grid hole with particles are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref>  Processed and raw data are being copied from ESRF server using rsync command. During the download, we are giving priority to the pre-processed images that we can use directly for CTF estimation and particle picking.</p><p>Data processing is being carried at KU Leuven using CryoSparc v 2.15.</p><p>Using the 2D templates from previous data collection we picked more than 120k particles from ~5000 micrographs. After several rounds of 2D classifcation, we had 40k particles suitable for 3D reconstruction (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>). We managed to refine the structure up to 20Å (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>). However, this is not sufficient.</p><p>Further processing is necessary in order to improve resolution.</p><p>During the initial inspection of the micrographs, we observed that template-based particle picking selected a lot of aggregated particles. Additional work must be done in order to optimize particle-picking strategy using the deep learning models (Topaz or Cryolo) as we can see that single particles are present in the micrographs (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1B</ref>).  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Biocrystallography, KU Leuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium</figDesc></figure>

The data were collected with the following parameters: magnification 105k, pixel size 1.35 Å/pixel, dose per movie 40.0 e -/Å 2 , number of frames per movie 40, defocus range: -1.0 --2.4 µm in 0.2 µm step .
