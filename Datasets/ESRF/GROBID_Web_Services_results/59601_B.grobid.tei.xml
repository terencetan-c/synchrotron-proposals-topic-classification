<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Prof. Luis Oriol have synthetized series of amphiphilic linear-dendritic block copolymers (LDBCs) that combined the responses to both mentioned stimuli. These systems self-assemble in water <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and that have been shown to encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Experimental. Simultaneous synchrotron Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS) and Wide Angle Xray Scattering (WAXS) data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) on the beam-line ID02, with a wavelength of 1 Å. SAXS results were collected with the detector at a samples-to-detector distances of 30m 5m and 1m giving a q-range of observed q-range of 2•10 -3 nm -1 &lt; q &lt; 6.99 nm -1 . A detector located at closer distance from the sample allows the collection of the wide angle X ray scattering signal from the sample in a q-range of 6.2 nm -1 &lt; q &lt; 50 nm -1 2D data were radially averaged and standard reduction procedures (subtraction of air scattering) were applied. Results and discussion. Several set of samples were studied. Experiments under UV irradiation were performed at room temperature, and SAXS patterns were collected while the sample was irradiated with a UV lamp (Phillips PL-S 9W) placed at a distance of 10 cm. On the other hand side chain azobenzene homopolymers and corresponding poly(methyl methacrylate) block copolymers have been synthesized by modification of polymeric scaffolds having pendant alkyne groups using azides from 2,2bis(hydroxymethyl)propanoic acid decorated with two motifs, either two azobenzenes or one azobenzene and one biphenyl. These systems were prepared in the form of films by solution casting. a solution of the polymer in toluene 1% (w/w) (40 μL) at 6000 rpm during 60 s over an amorphous silicon substrate. Films were dried for 24 h at 30 ºC under vacuum, and annealed for 24 h at 150 ºC under vacuum. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the scattering obtained for P70AZO/AZO-b-PMMA20k. At low angle, the scattering can be described as arising from a Gaussian distribution of spheres with a mean diameter of 18 nm and a another contribution of smaller particles centered around 3 nm. These results are consistent with other obtained by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). In the case of P70CNB/AZO-b-PMMA20k (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) the scattering can be described as arising from a Gaussian distribution of particles with average diameter 5.2 nm, and this was also corroborated by TEM (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The comparatively, higher tendency to phase segregation of P70AZO/AZO-b-PMMA block copolymers can be tentatively associated to the liquid crystalline behavior of the functionalized block.
