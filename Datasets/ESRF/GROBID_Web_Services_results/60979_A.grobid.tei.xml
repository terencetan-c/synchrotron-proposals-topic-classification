This is a Confidential Report because none of the data are published.</p><p>We accomplished all of the goals described in our beamtime proposal. The results described below are exciting new observations of nanowire toxicity. In combination with associated beamtime on ID21, and with numerous complementary laboratory studies of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, we anticipate this work will generate a very good publication that we have begun to work towards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Approach</head><p>We studied mouse fibroblast cells grown on a silicon nitride membrane and exposed to a low dose of silver nanowires (Ag NWs) for 24 hours. We studied Ag NW of similar mean length (9 µm) and two diameters (30 nm and 90 nm) to test for differences in internalization and fate. The cells were washed, rapidly frozen and studied under cryogenic conditions. We performed X-ray fluorescence mapping at 33 keV of exposed and control cells to identify individual cells containing NWs. We acquired phase contrast microscope images at two incident angles to construct stereogram images of cells containing Ag NW to verify that the NWs had been internalized. We acquired a full tomographic tilt series for a single cell to</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Major Findings</head><p>All internalized Ag NW were morphologically altered relative to their shape in water or cell culture medium. The 90-nm NW were bent while the 30-nm NW were completely crumpled and looped. These observations show that the NWs experience significant forces during internalization that we will seek to estimate. The different in shapes could partially explain our prior findings of differential toxicity for the two NW sizes.</p><p>None of the Ag NW penetrated the cell nucleus. Thus, although we observed single-and double-strand DNA damage, the mechanism must be through an indirect chemical process.</p><p>A fraction of internalized Ag NW were co-localized with physiological elements, while a portion showed none. Based on prior fluorescence microscopy studies, we speculate that the a fraction had ruptured the endosome membrane and entered the cytoplasm. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 X</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 X-ray fluorescence mapping and stereographic phase contrast imaging of mouse fibroblast cells containing internalized silver nanowires with mean diameter of 90 nm and length 9 µm.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,34.08,165.60,527.28,281.76" type="bitmap" /></figure>
