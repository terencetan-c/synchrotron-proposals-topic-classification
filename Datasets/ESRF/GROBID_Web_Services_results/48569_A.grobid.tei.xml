<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>The Experimental results: The recombinant single (R5, RI and RV) and multiple tandem repeat (R8V, RVVI and RI-II-III) proteins generated from the 14-repeat mucus binding protein (MUB) of Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 53608, were taken in PBS gel filtration buffer to the ESRF beamline ID14-EH3 for SAXS analysis.</p><p>Scattering data was collected for all proteins in a 1:2 dilution series with concentrations of 21 to 0.2 mg/mL for RI and 10 to 0.3 mg/mL for all other constructs. Matching buffer samples were exposed before and after each sample as a control.</p><p>Ideal scattering curves were generated by merging curves of different concentration, analysed via PRIMUS and values for R g and I(0) were determined from Guinier plot. A distance distribution function P(r) was computed manually using GNOM to describe particle shape and size by determining D max , R g and I(0) (see table ). The P(r) functions of all Mub proteins show the characteristic curve shape of elongated proteins with a steep increase to an early peak at an R (=D max ) value of 2 nm and long linear fall (P(r) of R5 shown as example) [1]. Estimated Molecular Dimensions: The estimated D max for the solution envelope of all tested single and double repeat proteins is in line with an expected molecule length of 11.0 nm observed in the R5 [2] and RV [unpublished data] crystal structures. However, the D max of 23.5 nm for the triple RI-II-III repeat is smaller than the theoretically expected value of 33.0 nm based on X-ray structure data of a single protein repeat, when manually computing a P(r) function with a linear fall especially close to the intersection of the curve with the x-axis [see figure below]. GNOM analysis for the triple repeat allowing a D max of 33 nm was not possible. Hence, the collected data can not describe the theoretical size for the triple repeat proteoin RI-II-III of 33 nm. Therefore, the P(r) function with a D max of 23.5 nm was used for subsequent solution envelope reconstruction.</p><p>Single Repeat Solution Structures: Ab-initio shapes were calculated by GASPOR (Atsas online tool) with P1 point group symmetry and averaged using DAMAVER. Model calculations with two fold point group symmetry did not result in a sensible shape reconstruction. The resulting 3D envelopes without symmetry for all single repeat proteins showed an elongated shape of Mub proteins in solution with a length of about 10.5 nm. The superposition of low resolution shape reconstruction with high resolution crystal structures of R5 and RV was performed by SUBCOMP20. The crystal structures agree well with the solution envelopes for all single repeat proteins tested (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tandem Repeat Solution Structures:</head><p>The resulting 3D envelopes (P1 symmetry) for tandem repeat proteins showed an elongated shape of Mub proteins in solution with a length of about 19.5 and 24.1 nm for double and the triple repeat proteins, respectively. The superposition of low resolution shape reconstruction with high resolution crystal structures of R5 and RV was again performed by SUBCOMP20. The agreement with crystal structure data fror the R8V and RVVI tandem repeat proteins was good (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>). However, as expected, the solution envelope of RI-II-III does not allow an overlay with three single RV molecules due to the absence of suitable data to describe the expected particle size of 33 nm. This may be due to insufficient protein sample quality and presence of aggregation in PBS buffer.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Lactobacillus reuteriMUB is a cell-surface protein that is involved in bacterial interaction with mucus and colonization of the digestive tract. The 353 kDa mature protein is representative of a broadly important class of adhesins that have remained relatively poorly characterized due to their large size and highly modular nature. MUB contains two different types of Mub repeat (Mub1 and Mub2) present in six (R-I to R-VI) and eight (R-1 to R-8) copies, respectively (Fig.1A) and shown to be responsible for the adherence to intestinal mucus. Mub1 and Mub2 repeats share 30-35% sequence identity (Fig.1B) and are expected to have similar 3D structures. We have solved the X-ray crystal structures of both Mub1 (RV) and Mub2 (R5; Fig1C) repeats each comprising two structurally-related domains[2]. In this experiment we sought to use small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) methods to determine the solution structures of MUB fragments consisting of various combinations of Mub1 and Mub2 repeats by fitting X-ray crystal structures of individual repeat proteins to solution X-ray scattering envelopes.</figDesc></figure>
