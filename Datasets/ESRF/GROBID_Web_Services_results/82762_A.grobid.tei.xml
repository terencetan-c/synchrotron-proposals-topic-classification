<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to determine the atomistic model for oxidation behaviour of Pt(100) and Pt(110) surfaces. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the oxidation for both orientations in Ar and O 2 saturated electrolytes and to assess the irreversible reconstruction dynamics upon the extensive potential cycling. This experiment was a continuation of our previous work on Pt <ref type="bibr">(111)</ref> surface which was well received by the community (3 published papers, 2 submitted papers).</p><p>Unfortunately given the problems with the stability of the beam, we were able to finish only part of the foreseen experiments. We focused on Pt(100) surface and characterized the oxidation only in Ar saturated electrolyte.</p><p>We started with the thorough crystallographic determination of the surface structure at different potentials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). We measured large datasets of 6 CTR's for 8 different potentials to find the structural evolution for progressively higher potentials. The data show clear trend in the CTR's shape and can be fitted with the place-exchange model developed recently by our group [1-2]. The fitting is in progress and will allow us to understand the oxidation process with atomic resolution.</p><p>The next step was to understand better the oxidation dynamics. For this experiment we performed several cycles between 0.1 V and 1.17 V while measuring the intensity at antibraggg position, which is very sensitive to the extent of oxidation (Fig 2). To our surprise, the oxidation of Pt(100) surface has significantly different behaviour when compared to the same experiment at Pt(111). First, on Pt(100) the oxidation starts at lower potential and, second, it is irreversible even for lower cycling potentials. This suggest that the oxidation process is faster on Pt(100) and the place-exchanged atoms loose their register with the substrate for lower potentials This results in an irreversible structural change. Such result has a wide consequences. It will be difficult to stabilize shaped fuel cell nanoparticle catalysts as the (100) facet will dissolve at higher rate and at lower potentials. This will lead to lost of the shape and therefore the activity of the catalyst.</p><p>To further clarify this point we performed potential step experiments. These gave us further details about the processes taking place during the oxidation, mostly the place-exchange kinetics. The comparison of these results with the one obtained on Pt(111) surface is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. On the left are plotted the slopes of the lines fitted to the F vs ln(time) curves for each step experiment. Preliminary analysis showed that the activation energy of the placeexchange process is lower for Pt(100) while the rates can be higher for Pt(111) for higher potentials. The right side shows the ratio of initial and final intensities during one cycle. This is a quantitative marker for the reversibility of the process as a function of potential. While the oxidation is reversible to 1.13 V for Pt(111), the Pt( <ref type="formula">100</ref>) is much less stable and the process is irreversible after the first signes of the place-exchange process. Therefore the stability of the real fuel cell catalyst would be very dependent on the shape of the nanoparticle and how much of the total surface area is composed of each different facet.</p><p>Unfortunately all experiments with longer acquisition time (e.g. long cycling GISAXS experiment) will need to be remeasured due to the beam instability. The beam instability is also responsible that we did not finish the measurements on Pt(110) surface and measurements with O 2 saturated electrolytes.</p><p>As a conclusion we summarize the expected results which were mentioned in the experimental proposal:</p><p>1. Find the structure of electrochemically formed Pt oxide on Pt(110) and Pt(100).</p><p>• Done for Pt(100) 2. Understand the differences of the oxidation behavior for different Pt faces by determining the state of the surface at different electrochemical potentials. • Done for Pt(100), compared to previous results measured on <ref type="bibr">Pt(111)</ref> 3. Determine the potentials for O adsorption and place exchange (the onset of quasi-3D oxidation) in both deareated and O 2 saturated electrolytes.</p><p>• Not done due to the beam instabilities 4. Understand the structural dependence of the processes leading to irreversible roughening and Pt dissolution.</p><p>• Not done due to the beam instabilities References:  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.
