<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have performed single-crystal x-ray diffraction with a monochromatic beam (0.3738 Å) on solid 4 He and solid 3 He at low temperature up to the Mbar range. The equation of state of 4 He was measured to 122 GPa at 6K. The equation of state of 3 He was measured to 65 GPa at 300K and at 65K on the same sample. The single crystals were grown in a membrane diamond anvil cell equipped with boron seats to offer an x-ray aperture of ± 35° . In the angle dispersive geometry, the direct beam should not touched the seats and therefore, horizontal slits were made in the boron seats. We could then rotate the cell by ±20°. The loading of the DAC were done in a high pressure vessel. Due to the high cost of 3 He, the loading density could not be very high and therefore the sample was quite small ( 30 µm diameter ).</p><p>The technique has been validated previously on ID30 ( report HS-1208). It is based on the use of a focussed monochromatic beam ( about 15 µm square) and a fast readout on-line image plate detector (MAR) . Observed reflection were correlated by the Single program. That works reasonably well for a simple hcp structure like He in which the index of the diffraction peaks can be easily guessed and the orientation matrix calculated. In the present stage, neither the determination of the rocking curves nor the direct analysis of the pattern of the image plate as a single crystal information are possible. A CCD detector is now being commissioned that is associated with a single-crystal software package. This new facility will certainly help to perform fine single crystal structural analysis under pressure. A dedicated cryostat was developed for this project. It has a large X-ray viewing, it is very compact and flows directly inside the diamond anvil. Therefore the cooling is very fast ( 2 or 3 hours) and the rotation of the cryostat very precise. Unfortunately, the making and position of the seals is very delicate and not always reproducible. That is the reason why sometimes a small leak of helium gas occurs that breaks the vacuum and limit the lowest temperature that could be reached. That is why the EOS of 3 He could be measured only at 65 K. We are currently changing the design of the cryostat to remove this problem. The aim of the experiment was to measure the isotopic shift between the EOS of 3 He and 4 He at low temperature. As seen in the figure below, the correct isotopic shift, as expected from a zero point effect, is measured: the EOS of 3 He is above the one of 4 He. But at 300K, the two EOS are crossing in an anomalous way. Further analysis and calculations are being performed to understand this problem. 18 shifts were given to the project. These were fully occupied to perform these difficult data acquisition. The results are very encouraging and we are confident that the same measurements could be performed in hydrogen that is the aim of the continuation proposal. 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 2,0 2,5 3,0 3,5 4,0 4,5 4 He at 6K 3 He at 65 K V inet fit 4 He P (G P a)</p><p>V (cm 3 /m ole)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>2 and He up to 200 GPa at very low temperature by angle-dispersive single-crystal XNames and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): *Paul Loubeyre, DPTA, CEA.
