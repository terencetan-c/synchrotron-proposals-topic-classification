As a result, we were able to collect a dataset of 9830 movies for E.coli ribosome.</p><p>In total 6 grids with frozen sample were loaded into the microscope. However only grids #3 and #10 were showing good ice quality and decent particle distribution. In total 10 grid squares were selected on grid#10.</p><p>Examples of a good grid square and a grid hole with particles are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref> and 1B. The data were collected with the following parameters: magnification 165k, pixel size 0.827 Å/pixel, number of frames per movie 40, dose per movie 45.0 e -/Å 2 . The overall statistics for resolution and astigmatism distribution is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1C</ref>.</p><p>Processed data were copied from ESRF server using rsync command and raw data were copied on hard drive and shipped to Leuven. During the download, we were giving priority to the pre-processed images that we could use directly for CTF estimation and particle picking. Data processing was carried at KU Leuven using CryoSparc v 2.15.</p><p>Initial processing was done using first 1700 micrographs and 190k particles were picked using blob picker. After partical inspection and several rounds of 2D classifcation, we had 93k particles suitable for 3D reconstruction.</p><p>Initial map resolution was 3.0 Å. Afterwards, preliminary 3D reconstruction was used to generate 2D templates for optimized particle picking. Template picker was applied to 2556 micrographs with estimated CTF-fit resolution better than 3.5Å. In total 500k particles were picked followed by particle extraction and 2D The binding site of the trypsin modulating oostatic factor is still being refined but the data look very promising and suitable for future publication.
