<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>XAS spectra at the Eu and Ce L 3 -edge have been successfully collected for a group of silicate glasses representing very different melt compositions, spanning from granitic to basaltic. Also, two glass samples doped with 1.0% wt. Eu 2 O 3 , were synthesized at very low redox conditions (Iron-Wüstite buffer) and analysed in order to investigate the effect of reducing conditions on Eu oxidation state. The use of up to 30 scans per sample and the high purity Ge detector, allowed to obtain spectra with a very good signal to noise ratio even for the most diluited europium bearing glasses (0.1% wt.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Europium bearing glasses</head><p>Detectable changes in the XANES spectra are observed in the studied glasses as a function of bulk composition (fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Absorption peak located at ca. 6975 eV and ca. 6983 eV are attributed to the presence of Eu +2 and Eu +3 , due to ca. 7.5-8 eV difference in the energy (Rakovan et al., 2001). Significant change in the intensity of these peaks can be observed when passing from basaltic to granitic glass compositions (DiAn and HPG8-Na respectively). Moreover, even within samples of granitic compositions, the introduction of Ca produces small but still detectable changes as compared to Ca-free samples (HPG8-An and HPG8-Na respectively). These changes can be interpreted as variations in the Eu 2+ /(Eu 2+ + Eu 3+ ) ratios which appear to be related by the glass composition. Furthermore, interesting considerations can be carried out observing the spectra of two samples synthesized at very low (Iron-Wüstite buffer) oxygen fugacities (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>); the amount of Eu +2 increases visibly respect to Eu 3+ and also a phase shift is observed in the EXAFS region, which means a change in the Eu-O distances in the first coordination shell. It is evident that the change in the Eu 2+ /(Eu 2+ + Eu 3+ ) ratio is much more pronounced for basaltic compositions than for granitic compositions despite both glasses have been produced under the same redox conditions. This is a topic which needs to be investigated in details given the strong consequences on the behaviour of Eu in melts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cerium bearing glasses</head><p>Ce in the analyzed glasses, all synthesized in air, is mostly in the 3+ state, but it appears to have a minor contribution from Ce <ref type="bibr">4+</ref> . Also cerium XANES data show important changes in the spectra as a function of composition (fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Considerable variations are observed between the different compositions (NS2 and HPG8 An, which represent disilicate and granitic compositions, respectively) both in the XANES and EXAFS spectra. The composition seems therefore to influence not only the presence of Ce +4 , but also the local geometry around Ce in the different glasses. XAS data of Ce model compounds, CeO 2 and Ce-pyrochlore (Na,Ca,Ce) 2 (Nb,Ti,Fe) 2 O 6 F, have been collected as well, in order to interpret some spectral features (presence/absence of a pre-edge peak, and variations of the white-line intensity and energy position). Theoretical XANES calculations will be performed by the MXAN code in order to reproduce the spectral features found in the experimental data, whereas theoretical EXAFS calculations have been already performed using the GNXAS package.</p><p>6950 6960 6970 6980 6990 7000 7010 7020 Normalised Absorption (arb. units) Energy (eV) 1.0% Eu 2 O 3 Eu 2 O 3 HPG8 20%Na HPG8 20%An NS2 DiAn Eu +3 Eu +2 Fig.1 -Experimental spectra (XANES region) for silicate glasses of different compositions, synthetised in air and doped with 1.0% wt.
