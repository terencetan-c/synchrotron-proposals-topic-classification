<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In situ characterisation of sweet oilfield corrosion scaling as a function of salinity </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Internal corrosion of oilfield facilities fabricated from carbon steel due to the presence of CO 2 dissolved in the aqueous phase of the produced fluids (oil/gas/water) is of huge concern, and much effort is expended to keep it under control. A lack of mechanistic insight into relevant corrosion phenomena, however, is restricting progress in this area to largely empirically based advances. One key, missing ingredient is detailed knowledge of potentially protective CO 2 -induced (sweet) corrosion scales formed on carbon steel in oilfield environments. The aim of this study was to address this issue through elucidating the nature of such scales in situ with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), as well as probing the kinetics of their nucleation/growth. More specifically, we have focused on the impact of aqueous phase salinity, which varies significantly with oilfield geology, and is known to influence both scale composition and kinetics.</p><p>Typically, sweet corrosion scales on carbon steel are labelled as siderite (FeCO 3 ). However, these scales are almost certainly more complex. For example, a recent in situ GIXRD study conducted by our group at XMaS <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has shown that whilst the primary scale component on a pipeline carbon-steel (X-65) was siderite (FeCO 3 ), chukanovite (Fe 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 ) was also present. In addition, a so-called green rust carbonate (Fe 6 (OH) 12 CO 3 ) was apparent during the early period of immersion.</p><p>Concerning sweet corrosion/scaling as a function of aqueous phase salinity, our research group has been exploring this topic, employing electrochemical measurements in tandem with ex situ scale characterisation techniques. We have examined the corrosion of polycrystalline Fe in CO 2 -saturated NaCl (aq) solutions (0 M -1 M), and found that increasing NaCl (aq) concentration can retard the growth of the corrosion scale, as well as modifying the scale composition, i.e. in 0 M NaCl solution both siderite and chukanovite were found to be scale components, whereas only siderite was identified in 0.01 M -1 M NaCl solutions. The goal of the current work was to gain further insight into the impact of NaCl (aq) on scale growth mechanisms through in situ GIXRD to probe the evolution of the scales as a function of time in the presence/absence of NaCl (aq) (0 M/1 M). Two specific questions, pertinent to the mechanism of sweet scale formation, we wished to address through these in situ measurements were:</p><p>(i) Does chukanovite form as a precursor to siderite in the presence of NaCl (aq) ? (ii) Does the occurrence of green rust carbonate <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref> depend upon the presence of NaCl (aq) ?</p><p>In situ GIXRD measurements were undertaken employing synchrotron radiation from beam line BM28 (XMaS). For these measurements, a custom-made electrochemical-cell (E-cell), allowing both GIXRD and electrochemical corrosion rate monitoring, was mounted on the diffractometer stage. A photon energy of hν = 15 keV, and an incidence angle (α i ) of 3° were used for data acquisition.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> displays a selection of diffractograms, acquired in situ as a function of immersion time, from polycrystalline Fe immersed in CO 2 -saturated 0 M NaCl solution; pH = ~ 6.8, T = 80°C. The bottommost plot is that of the polished substrate, acquired prior to immersion. Three peaks, located at ~ 24°, ~ 34° and ~ 41°, can be attributed to originate from the bulk of the substrate, i.e. they are due to α-Fe. Features at low values of 2θ (~ 0° -14°) can all be assigned to scattering from the kapton film that was used as an X-ray transparent window in the E-Cell. After 4.5 h of immersion siderite (FeCO 3 ), chukanovite (Fe 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 ), and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) are all present on the Fe surface (as indicated by the annotation on the figure), and persist up to the last measurement shown at 10 h. The presence of chukanovite is consistent with the previous ex situ measurements, where this phase was also apparent at 0 M concentration of NaCl.</p><p>Unfortunately, no measurements with 1 M NaCl solution were performed due to a beam line failure (shutter started to leak), which significantly curtailed our beam time (~ 2 days were lost). Given this issue, further time is required to complete these measurements, and another application will be submitted.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): M.
