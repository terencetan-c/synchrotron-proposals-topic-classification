<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Context: Commercial wLEDs are composed of blue InGaN diodes and micron-sized Y3Al5O12 doped with 1 mol.% Ce 3+ (YAG:Ce) phosphors inserted in an epoxy or silicone dome. The use of micron-sized phosphors and their encapsulation in resins induce reduced efficiency and limited ageing properties. To overcome these drawbacks the idea is to use YAG:Ce nanoparticles (50 to 100 nm in size) that will decrease light scattering and allow a binder-free shaping. However, the oxidation of luminescent Ce 3+ into nonluminescent Ce 4+ is a common process in nanocrystals as it is often favored by the wet chemical methods used to produce nanoparticles and, moreover, it is promoted at the particle surface [1]. The presence of Ce 4+ ions, even at low concentration, is highly detrimental for the photoluminescence (PL) properties as Ce 4+ acts as a PL quencher, favoring non-radiative processes (PL poison), and should thus be absolutely avoided. The aim of these high-resolution XANES experiments was to follow the oxidation state of Ce in nano-YAG samples both post-synthesis and in situ in order to determine the best experimental conditions ensuring cerium in its 3+ oxidation state.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental:</head><p>The oxidation state of Ce in nanocrystals of Ce-doped Y3Al5O12 (YAG:Ce) was examined using high-resolution XANES experiments at the L3 edge of Ce (5.723 keV), both on already-synthesized nanopowders and during the solvothermal synthesis in the FAME high T-P autoclave <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The in situ experiments were performed in a vitreous carbon cell into which the precursors dissolved in 1,4-butanediol were introduced between two pistons equipped with Viton seals. The typical external pressure applied was 200 bars. Numerous synthesis parameters (temperature, precursor concentration, annealing posttreatment) were explored with the goal of determining the best synthesis parameters leading to the formation of YAG:Ce nanocrystals with minimal Ce 4+ concentration. For each synthesis the Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ ratio was determined and quantified using standards (CeO2 nanopowder for Ce 4+ and Ce(acetate)3 dissolved in 1,4-butanediol for Ce 3+ ). In addition to studying nano-YAG:Ce, we examined the oxidation state of cerium in nano-Gd3Sc2Al3O12 (GSAG), another very promising phosphor <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. A total of 4 in situ (in autoclave) and 16 ex situ (on powder) experiments were performed. The high sensitivity of the BM16 (FAME-UHD) was necessary to observe the Ce signal, especially during the in situ experiments for which the Ce concentration was very low (10 -3 mol/L). This low concentration is mandatory as Ce 3+ ions, doping ions responsible for photoluminescent (PL) properties, must be diluted in the matrix to avoid PL quenching through energy transfers between near neighbors Ce cations (1 mol% in YAG, i.e. Y2.97Ce0.03Al5O12). Moreover the YAG precursor concentration should be kept low to control the nucleation and growth of nano-YAG:Ce and obtain nanocrystals in the 50-100 nm range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>The oxidation state of cerium ions during the nano-YAG:Ce synthesis was successfully detected, even considering the low Ce concentration and could be quantified using standard references for Ce 4+ and Ce 3+ . The in situ detection of cerium oxidation state as a function of the synthesis temperature shows that the oxidation of Ce 3+ into Ce 4+ occurs at temperatures higher than 300°C and that the proportion of Ce 4+ increases as the synthesis temperature increases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). These results are consistent with our in situ Raman observations performed on the same system and under the same operating conditions. Indeed, Raman spectroscopy evidenced the dehydration of the solvent (1,4butanediol) above 300°C. This water departure probably creates an oxidizing environement that induces cerium oxydation. The presence of Ce 4+ is detected whatever the nanocrystal size, which tends to indicate that the oxidation occurs during the synthesis process and not afterwards at the surface of the particles. We show that a post-annealing treatement at 1600°C under vacuum allows the reduction of all Ce 4+ into Ce 3+ but also induce an unwanted particle sintering as observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy. Interestingly, Ce-doped GSAG nanopowder exhibits only Ce in its 3+ state (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). We believe the presence of Sc 3+ creates a more reducing environment and favors the preservation of the 3+ oxidation state of cerium ions. This result opens the door to new garnet-type nanophosphor engineering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions &amp; perspectives:</head><p>This set of experiments enabled for the first time to quantify in situ the Ce 3+ /Ce 4+ in YAG:Ce nanocrystals during their nucleation and growth in high T-P autoclave. It reveals that, although high-temperature high-pressure process is efficient to produce well-crystallized nanocrystals with a controlled size as we recently published <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>, it favors the oxidation of cerium at high temperature. Further experiments in reducing atmosphere should be performed to preserve the cerium ions in their 3+ oxidation state. Moreover, the results obtained on GSAG:Ce pave the way to new nanophosphor engineering.</p></div>
