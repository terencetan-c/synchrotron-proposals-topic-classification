<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We studied the 300, 500, 700, 710 and 7-10 reflections, which are all forbidden Bragg reflections of the Pnma spacegroup and present various interference effects between both Iron sites. Rocking curves revealed a quite high mozaicity of the crystal. Therefore we systematically measured rocking curves at several energies and on full azimuthal range, in order to correct the data with reliable integrated intensities. The azimuthal dependence of intensities integrated over the rocking curves is shown on Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Full bidimentional energy/azimuth maps were measured (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). 710 and 7-10 reflections could be measured on partial azimuthal range only, because of the limitation on theta rotation. The data are of very high quality, with good statistics and low noise. However, multiple scattering effects are responsible for numerous parasitic peaks. Data analysis should carefully identify them in order to provide a reliable data set for simulation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Iron orthobrarate (Fe 3 BO 6 ) is a complex magnetic material from spacegroup Pnma with two distinct iron sites. Preliminary measurements on XMaS beamline as well as computer simulations predicted interesting multipole effects in the x-ray resonant scattering at the Fe K-edge. Due to the lower symetry of the resonant atomic scattering tensor compared to the crystal symmetry, diffraction occur at forbidden Bragg reflections. The quadrupole-dipole and quadrupole-quadrupole terms of the resonant scattering yield diffraction in the pre-edge region with azimuthal dependence different from the main resonance lines.</p><p>In this experiment, we measured several forbidden Bragg reflections from a Fe 3 BO 6 single crystal at room temperature. Measurements were carried out with XMaS diffractometre in vertical 4-circle configuration. Motorized slits in front of the sample were used to restrict the beam to the size of the sample (a plate of surface ~ 2 mm x 3 mm with crystal a-axis normal to the surface). Data were collected with a Vortex Si Drift Diode providing energy resolution, thus allowing separation of elastic scattering from fluorescence.</p></div>			</div>
