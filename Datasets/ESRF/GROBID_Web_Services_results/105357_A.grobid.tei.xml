<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of this project was to study in situ MXene synthesis using reaction of T3AlC2 (MAX-phase) with LiF/HCl. This method is very common and provides "clay-like" Ti3C2Tx Mxene. The reaction occurs as an etching Al from MAX phase structure with formation of 2D layers of Mxene. Water washing is also essential step in the synthesis as it removes acid from Mxene interlayers and assists in termination of 2D layers surface with functional groups. So far, only the reaction products were studied using ex situ methods. The structural changes due to etching of Al from MAX phase, possible intermediate phases, effects of lattice expansion and swelling are not possible to study using ex situ characterization. The synthesis is sufficiently simple to allow in situ XRD study at slightly elevated temperatures (40-60 0 ) inside of plastic capillaries.</p><p>Following the experiment plan, we performed set of in situ synthesis experiments at ID22 with progressively increased temperature of reaction (40 0 C to 60 0 C). Special cell was designed for the experiment allowing to mix LiF and HCl over the precursor MAX phase directly inside of plastic capillary. Glass capillaries can be used in these experiments due to reaction with hydrogen fluoride. Using plastic capillaries creates some problems due to strong and non linear background. Over broad range of angles. However, background is not a problem at low angle region where the most important reflections from MAX phase and Mxene are found. Another problem is bubbles which for in process of reaction, especially within first minutes. Evolving bubbles move the whole powder sample and provide strong noise in terms of absolute intensity of diffraction peaks. Some plastic net</p></div>

As expected, the reaction was visibly easy to detect due to some bubbles evolving in first few minutes. However, no changes in the structure of material were observed by XRD during this stage of reaction. First signs of new MXene phase were detected after about 30 min.</p><p>Figure .1 shows results of first experiment started at 313K. Due to the rather slow rate of transformation the temperature was increased to 323k and later to 333K. As it follows from these data, the reaction is still slow but kinetics is improved at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, even after ~6 hours the transformation was not complete. Separate experiments were performed next with new samples for prolonged periods of time at 313, 323 and 333K. Preliminary analysis of data is shown in the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The data were obtained using batch fitting, some "bad points" will be later checked manually and possibly corrected. Additional experiment was performed with materials exposed to the reaction ex situ for 12 hours at 318K and for 19 hours at room temperature. In this case amount of etching solution is significantly larger and the reaction is more complete. Separate experiment was also performed with water washing of reaction products. Water was added to capillaries and XRD data recroded during certain period of time.</p><p>Preliminary analysis of recorded data shows the value of in situ XRD experiments. We are first to record XRD patterns directly in process of etching and before washing the reaction products with water. The c-lattice expansion observed for MXene directly in LiF/HCl is different compared to dry MXene material after water washing and in water immersed (swollen) state. We expect that analysis of XRD data will provide novel information about the mechanism of reaction and will be used as a core for high quality publication.</p><p>0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Relative area of Peak I vs Peak II Time (min) 313 K 323 K 333 K 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 280 240 200 160 120 80 40 Diffraction angle 2Θ (°) T im e ( m in ) Intensity (arb.un.)
