<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Materials: Regio-regular poly(hexylthiophene) (R-PHT) with &gt; 98% head-tail couplings, and FeCl 3 polymerised poly(octylthiophene) (POT) with ~80% h-t couplings, were used. Closely analogous results were obtained also for poly(dodecylthiophene) and other poly(thiophene) derivatives.</p><p>A few drops of low concentration (~ 1 mg / ml) of the polymer dissolved in chloroform were spread on a clean water surface in a shallow teflon trough. Ultra-thin (down to 10 nm), faintly reddish layers were produced by the spreading technique. Efforts to further reduce the film thickness by using more diluted solutions failed, leading to the formation of numerous islands rather than a homogeneous film.</p><p>The films were studied at the X-ray beam line ID10B at the ESRF, with ? = 1.55Å. A 1D position sensitive detector covering a vertical angle ? of approximately 8º was used for collecting the scattered intensity. The detector could be moved a horizontal angle d from the plane of the incident beam and the surface normal. An incidence angle of 0.15º was used.</p><p>For in situ doping of the floating films, NOPF 6 dissolved in acetonitrile was injected into the water subphase. Acetonitrile was chosen because it can dissolve NOPF 6 , and is miscible with water, but does not affect the polymer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diffraction results:</head><p>Using GID, we could observe the 100 and 010 reflections, also for films down to a thickness of 100Å (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for 100). For probing the anisotropy, the detector was scanned in the d -direction, thereby effectively mapping the Debye-Scherrer cone. Strong anisotropy was thus revealed: The intensity along the Debye-Scherrer ring of 100 is confined to the region of scattering vector perpendicular to the film plane, with FWHM along the ring as low as ~12º for regio-regular PHT. From previous knowledge of the structure, this implies a preferred orientation of the side chains and the thiophene rings perpendicular to the substrate plane, in fact as reported also for thicker films. Conversely, the 010 reflection could only be observed for scattering vector parallel to the substrate, as a broad peak around d = 23.5º± 0.5º. From the width of the 100 diffraction peak, the average dimension of the crystallites could be estimated to about 100Å. This shows that such ultra-thin films (consisting of only five molecular layers) are in fact single-domain in the direction of their thickness (see later for thickness determination); each crystallite protrudes the film.</p><p>Doping is known to give rise to some structural changes in PATs, notably a contraction of the b-axis and an expansion of the a-axis. In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> the change of the a-axis following in situ doping of the floating films with NOPF 6 is clearly seen, a remarkable effect. The doping could also be observed visually, as the film changed its colour from being weakly reddish to a hardly visible pale blue. Dedoping takes place; after 2 hours the film is regaining its original colour accompanied by a contraction of the a-parameter.</p><p>Morphology by reflectometry: Using specular reflectometry on a POT film floating on the water surface, the pattern of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> was recorded. The fitted curve is obtained by applying standard matrix formalism from optical theory of stratified media. Both curves are multiplied by Q 4 for increased readability, which also explains the drop in intensity for Q smaller than the critical wave vector of reflection Q c . The best fit was obtained using a density profile as shown in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The refractive indices of water and polymer were determined from tabulated values. The rough air-polymer interface was fit using a Gaussian smearing of the profile with s = 5.3Å. As is seen from the inset, the contrast is quite small between polymer and water. This particular film is seen to have a thickness of about 100Å, corresponding to roughly 5 repetition units along the a-axis.</p><p>The feature at Q ~ 0.3Å -1 is a result of the film's internal structure, a Bragg-like signal interfering with the reflections from the interfaces. The best fit was obtained assuming an exponentially damped harmonic variation of the electron density, a model sometimes used for modelling smectic liquid crystals. The periodicity of the fitted modulation was 20.8 Å, i.e. comparable to the a -parameter of solid POT, being 20.4 Å. Physically, the model can be interpreted as a well-developed layering near the air-polymer interface, deteriorating into the film. The ordering is least pronounced at the polymer-water interface, in qualitative agreement with the hydrophobicity of the aliphatic side chains. For intermediate depths, the arrangement is a compromise between the polymer's inherent tendency of layering and the reluctance of the side chains to being submerged in water.</p><p>0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 γ / °d et / mon ↓ pristine ↓ +5 min ↓ +130 min 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 10 -6 10 -5 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 Q / Å ~ R ⋅ Q 4 -50 0 50 100 150 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 -6 Depth in Film / nm ~ electron density Air Polymer Water .

The inset shows the fitted variation of the scattering density (the deviation from unity of the real part of refractive index) through the floating film, as placed between air and water. The periodic variation corresponds to the crystallographic unit cells (20.8Å), being damped by surface effects.</p><p>Other results: Some conjugated polymers films on Si or glass substrates were also investigated for structure, anisotropy or morphology: R-PHT, POT, PDoDT, PDOT 3 , PEDOT-PSS, PEDOT1-ClO 4 , PEDOT10-ClO 4 , the three former obtained by transfer to glass after being formed as floating films on water surfaces.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Fig. 1 Fig. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig.1 Diffraction signal from a floating R-PHT film before doping, immediately after, and about 2 hours after adding NOPF6 to the subphase.
