<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Preliminary report: The experiment was partly successful. A test measurement with graphite proved the viability of "looking inside" a working coin cell using the multi channel collimator (MCC) and obtaining high quality XRD data.</p><p>Unfortunately, the 30x18 micron focussed beam (focused with X-ray lenses) was so intense it shut down the electrochemistry at the illuminated spot and no changes were occurred despite clear electrochemical evidence of full lithiation of graphite. Scanning slightly away from the area illuminated during the operando test showed lithiation. We intend to publish this as a short study of beam deactivation during operando battery XRD (especially at very bright sources). The influence of the beam is not limited to the directly illuminated area.</p><p>For the main study on silicon and silicon nitride we used a sample holder to scan over 5 cells, allowing time for each to "cool" between XRD scans. We also made a line scan across each cell, averaging the data afterwards. This not only prevented the beam from stopping electrochemistry in specific areas, but also gave us different regions to choose from. Unfortunately, it was difficult to ensure that the electrodes inside the cells were aligned parallel to the beam, and this combined with the long footprint of the beam gauge volume and relatively thin electrodes meant that significant amounts of copper current collector were sampled along with the active material. This caused problems with the PDF analysis as the crystalline copper dominates the PDF, we are working on methods for improving this, including use of difference PDF. For future experiments a smaller beam is suggested. KB mirrors could be a possibility, but this level of focussing has apparently not been tried with the MCC before. For crystalline silicon the amorphization process during lithiation is clearly observed, from inside a normal coin cell (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). This kind of data collection previously proved impossible with XRDCT due to multiple scattering from different regions of the sample, leading to multiple overlapped Bragg peaks. Due to the small area of the Pilatus 2M detector covered by the MCC, effects from the sensor chip boundaries caused significant glitches in the integrated 1D scattering patterns-this introduced noise at low radial distances into the PDFs. We combatted this to some extent by collecting four images in each sample position, each with a slightly different detector position to cover the chip edges. In future we suggest using more detector scans or a taller MCC to further improve the results.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):David Wragg*, Alexey Koposov*, Casper Skautvedt*, Erlend T.
