These were on R2 crystals from mouse RNR soaked with Co(II) and Mn(II) for 3 hours. Earier experment with shorter soak times did only have one metal ion binding in the dinuclear site (earlier reported wrongly with site full in report LS 1884). The structures of the two metal complexes of R2-RNR have been satisfactorily refined and selected data for the models are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

Unfortunately, both datasets proved to be impossible to process, propably due to twinning in the enantiomeric space group P4 3 2 1 2. This very interesting mutant is now crystallized in another space group and data was collected collected at SNBL (see report 01-01-311/312).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Copy of Pubished abstract: Compound II in Peroxidases: New Resonance Forms Suggested by pH Dependent Structures of Myoglobin Intermediates Formed by Reaction with Peroxides. Hans-Petter Hersleth a , Bjørn Dalhus a , Carl Henrik Görbitz a , K. Kristoffer Andersson b . a Department of Chemistry, University of Oslo, P. O. Box 1033 Blindern, 0315 Oslo, NORWAY (e-mail: h.p.hersleth@kjemi.uio.no) b Department of Biochemistry, University of Oslo, P. O. Box 1041 Blindern, 0316 Oslo, NORWAY</p><p>The biological conversions of O 2 and peroxides to water as well as certain incorporations of oxygen atoms into small organic molecules can be catalyzed by metal-ions in different clusters or cofactors. The catalytic cycles of these reactions pass through similar metal-based complexes in which one oxygen-or peroxide-derived oxygen atom is coordinated to an oxidized form of the catalytic metal-center. In haem-based peroxidases or oxygenases the ferryl (Fe IV O) form is important in the compound I and compound II complexes, which are two and one oxidation equivalents higher than the ferric (Fe III ) form, respectively. In this study we report three high resolution X-ray structures of a compound II model protein, obtained by reacting hydrogen peroxide with ferric myoglobin at pH 5.2 (with 1.35 Å resolution), 6.8 and 8.7. The molecular geometry is virtually unchanged compared to the ferric form, indicating that these reactive intermediates do not undergo large structural changes. The essential Fe⋅⋅⋅O distance is 1.9 Å at all pH-values. This observation, together with the hydrogen bonding of the distal histidine, suggests that the dominating compound II resonance form is possibly a hydroxyl radical-ferric iron 1 at low pH and a hydroxyl-ferryl iron at high pH, and not an oxo-ferryl form as has been suggested previously. The 1.9 Å Fe⋅⋅⋅O distance is in agreement with an EXAFS study of compound II in horseradish peroxidase.</p></div>
