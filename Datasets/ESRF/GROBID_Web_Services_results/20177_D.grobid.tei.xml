<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Structure Heavy Atom soaks on Epsilon Prototoxin Two datasets were collected of recombinant epsilon prototoxin, of which a previous native dataset has already been collected to a resolution of 2.5Å. The two compounds chosen had previously produced promising but unsuccessful results with the wild type prototoxin. Both datasets went to a resolution of about 4Å and produced satisfactory statistics with SCALA, scaling in P321. Further processing has however indicated complete none-isomprhism with both the native dataset and each other, even when the data sets are reindexed. This problem has occurred with the wild-type prototoxin and so single crystal experiments will be needed to solve the structure.</p><p>K 2 PtCl 4 NaAuCl 4 Diffraction Limit (Å) 4 3.8 Rmerge (%) 8.3 10.3 I/sd 19 12.5 Comp (%) 98.7 98.8 Mult (%)) 4.8 4.5</p><p>Se-Met data from prototoxin and toxin crystals:</p><p>Single wavelength datasets were taken of the recombinant Semet derivatives both of these diffracted well to 2.5Å. Upon processing these data sets it became clear that they were however perfectly twinned with the an apparent symmetry of p6 3 22.
