<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Core-Shell nanoparticles composed of soft(-Fe 2 O 3 )-hard(Mn 3 O 4 ) ferrimagnets (FiM) were studied through X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). Two different types of particles with different core size and equal shell thickness were analyzed, Sample1 [-Fe 2 O 3 (7 nm)/Mn 3 O 4 (2nm)] and Sample2 [-Fe 2 O 3 (11nm)/Mn 3 O 4 (2nm)].</p><p>Measurements were carried out at the ID08 beam line in total electron yield (TEY) and fluorescence (FY) modes, using the 5 T cryomagnet setup. Note that the FY mode was mainly used to prove that TEY mode could penetrate enough to get information on the whole particle.</p><p>The XAS spectra the O K-edge and at the Mn and Fe L 2,3 -edges were recorded to get further insight into crystallographic structure of the core and the shell. On the other hand, XMCD at the Fe and Mn L 2,3 edges were measured to selectively address the magnetization of the two FiM layers. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows absorption spectra (XAS) measured using TEY mode at the Mn and Fe L 2,3 and O K edges at 5 T field at 10K, after field cooling in 5T. Confirming our Xray diffraction data, the Mn and Fe spectra are consitent with the expected for -Fe 2 O 3 and Mn 3 O 4 phases. Nevertheless, interestingly, the Mn edge spectrum seems to somewhat deviate from the theoretical one for Mn 3 O 4 . From the relative intensity of the peaks the spectra can be understood as a mixed signal from pure Mn 3 O 4 and another Mn-oxide phase formed mainly by Mn 2+ ions. The XMCD spectrum confirms that Mn is not in a single phase but it is formed by a mixed contribution of Mn 3 O 4 and another Mn oxide phase. This additional contribution can probably be ascribed to an intermediate, inner, shell between the core and the outer shell formed by a mixed Mn-Fe oxide. The XMCD also shows that the Fe-and Mn-based phases are magnetic both at 10 K and at room temperature, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, confirming the presence of another Mn-based phase with T C &gt; T RT , different from Mn 3 O 4 (T C ~ 40K). Hysteresis loops, Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, were acquired by recording the field dependnece of the XMCD signal at the energies coresponding to three main peaks of Fe-edge and for the main energy of the Mn-edge, after field cooling in 5T. The loops were carried out up 2 T to saturate the hard magnetic part. Remarkanbly, appart from a linear background in the Mn-edge loop, the loops at the Fe-and Mn-edges are very similar (e.g., with the same coercivity). This is somewhat unexpected and requires further experiments to fully understand this behavior.Moreover, both nanoparticles (small and large -Fe 2 O 3 core) exhbibit very similar behavior with Fe-edge and Mn-edge loops showing very similar features. The results may indicate that the soft and hard phase are strongly coupled to each other, thus reversing coherently.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, XAS spectra for O K ,Mn and Fe L 2,3 edges at 10 K in 5T after field cool in 5 T for Sample1 Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, XAS spectra for O K ,Mn and Fe L 2,3 edges at 300 K in 5T for Sample1 Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, Hysteresis loops recorded at 10K after field cool in 5T, the loops were acquiered for the main energie peaks of Fe (3) Mn (1) XMCD spectra for Sample1</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fisica Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona Facultat de Ciencies E-08193</figDesc></figure>
