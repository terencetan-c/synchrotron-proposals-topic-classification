<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>High frequency dynamics in amourphous and crystalline Carbon doped GeTe: investigating the origin of their similar ultra low thermal conductivity.</p><p>Experiment number: HC-2822 Beamline: Date of experiment: from: 25/01/17 to: 31/01/17 Date of report: 28/02/17 Shifts: Local contact(s):Luigi Paolasini Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): A. Tlili*, V. M. Giordano*, S. Pailhes*, P. Noe*, J.-Y. Raty Report:</p><p>Phase-Change Materials (PCM) exhibit a unique combination of properties from a reversible and ultra-fast amorphous/crystal transition to drastic differences in electronic properties, which put them at the forefront of research for optical and electronic storage. Among emerging non-volatile resistive memories, Phase Change Random Access Memories are at this day the most promising alternative technology in order to replace the current "flash memory". This technology exploits the unique properties of chalcogenide based materials, with an electrical resistance changing by several orders of magnitude upon crystallization and a very low thermal conductivity in both phases, especially important as it allows decreasing the electric power needed for inducing the crystal-to-amorphous transition by Joule heating, and makes further electronic devices miniaturization accessible.</p><p>In this context, much attention has been given to binary GeTe, where carbon doping has been found to greatly improve the high temperature retention properties, specifically increasing the crystallization temperature. Surprisingly, doping GeTe with carbon dramatically changes its thermal properties: measurements performed on C-GeTe thin films show that while doping only slightly decreases the thermal conductivity in the amorphous phase, it dramatically reduces the one of the crystalline phase, of a factor larger than 10, making it very similar to the value in the corresponding amorphous phase. Such reduction can only be due to a dramatic change in phonon transport, as the crystalline electronic conductivity is reduced by only 30% for C doping in the 10-15% range (our work).</p><p>In order to get insight into the similarities or differencies in the vibrational properties of amorphuos and crystalline C-GeTe we have performed an IXS investigation at ID28. Measurements have been done on samples deposited as thin films onto a Si substrate, the standard preparation for use in microelectronics. For this experiment, we have prepared 1 micron thick films for getting the signal from a larger material quantity, Measurements have been done in a grazing incidence geometry, putting the sample vertically and impinging on it with the X ray beam at an angle close to the total reflection angle. We used the Si 999 reflection of the monochromator, in order to have a larger flux, despite the lower resolution (3meV). In these conditions, we have succeeded in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: experimental spectrum collected on the crystalline film at q=5.4nm -1 measuring the acoustic dispersion in the polycrystalline sample for wavevectors larger than 4 nm-1. Indeed, at smaller wavevectors the phonons were hidden by the elastic line, due to its important intensity and large width. An example of a spectrum collected at q=5.4nm -1 is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p>Measurements on the amorphous sample turned out to be much more difficult due to the intense elastic line and to a smaller sound velocity. Nevertheless, we could extract phonon velocity and broadening in the limited 4-6 nm -1 range.</p><p>A spectrum collected at q=5.4 nm-1 is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> in the left panel. The right panel reports the same data after subtraction of the elastic line, together with the fit with a single excitation mode. Only positive energies are here reported for better visibility. Note the intensity values: 10000 counts for the elastic line and 40 counts for the phonon.</p><p>Our preliminary analysis indicates that the polycrystal has a larger average speed of sound but a comparable phonon broadening, leading to a mean free path of only about 1 nm for wavevectors larger than 5 nm-1. At lower q, however, the mean free path is much longer, as the resolution-limited width of the phonon at q=4.2 suggests.</p><p>We also collected test data at high q (q~35nm -1 ), where the spectrum should reflect the orientationnally averaged vibrational density of states. In this case the subtraction of the elastic line turned out to be quite difficult and not reliable for energies below 5 meV. These data have motivated us in submitting a DOS proposal at ID18, with the aim of exploring lower energies, thanks to the higher and sharper resolution.</p><p>Concerning the phonon dynamics, we would definitely need to complete our data by using the Si 12 12 12 on the crystalline and amorphous systems to access smaller qs. At the end of the beamtime, we could test the Si 12 12 12 on the polycrystalline sample in order to obtain the feasibility demonstration. However, there was no time to collect good statistics data. An example of spectrum at q=3.2 is reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>In the case of the amorphous sample, we plan to peel the film and prepare a powder sample between 2 diamond windows, with the optimal thickness of 80 microns. In this way we will be able to have a much stronger phonon signal. Fig. 3: high q spectra, as summed over all analysers after the elastic line subtraction. Fig. 4: Test spectrum on the polycrystalline film at the Si 12 12 12 reflection of the monochromator at q=3.2nm -1 . The red line corresponds to the elastic line, to improve the visibility of the inelastic signal.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig.2: left: spectrum collected on the amorphous C-GeTe at q=5.4nm -1 .
