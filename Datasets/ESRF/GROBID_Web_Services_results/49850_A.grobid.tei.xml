Where appropriate, MgCl 2 (5 mM) and double-stranded phage λ DNA were added. To reduce the degree of protein aggregation some of the samples were treated with Triton-X100 (0.05%) followed by centrifugation on a dialysis membrane 10 kDa. For all samples the data show high degree of protein aggregation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), pointing to formation of amorphous polydisperse aggregates with the size of 25 nm and larger. Decrease of the protein concentration from 4.5 to 0.5 mg/ml did not affect the aggregation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Treatment with Triton-X100 had some effect on the scattering spectrum but did not eliminate the aggregates. Protein aggregation did not allow us to make any conclusions regarding the protein oligomeric state. However, the subsequent investigation of the aggregation of TIP49a protein aggregation by DLS have revealed the presence of two aggregate fractions with the hydrodynamic diameters of 16 nm (mass fraction ~70%) and 60 nm (~30%). An addition of Triton-X100 completely eliminated the fraction of the smaller aggregates with the reduction of the mass of the larger aggregates to less than 2% of the total mass. The average size of the larger 60 nm aggregates did not change, while the most of the consistent with particles with the gyration radius of 4.7 nm. These results appear consistent with those obtained in the presious SANS measurements but due to scattering by the aggregates can not be considered reliable and further purification of the sample from the aggregates (which, according to DLS account for less than 2% of the protein mass) is required.</p><p>Results were recently presented on FEBS-2013 congress and included in: Lebedev D.V., Sokolova M.L., Fedorova Ya.V., Pobegalov G.E., Chervyakova D.B., Landa, S.B., Khodorkovskiy M.A. Supramolecular structures formed by TIP49A protein in vitro.
