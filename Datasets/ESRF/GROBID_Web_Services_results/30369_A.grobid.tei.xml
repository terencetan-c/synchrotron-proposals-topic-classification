<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report : During the present 01-01-677 In-House experiment three series of zeolitic sorbent/water systems have been investigated : (1) -the NaY/water, (2) -the BaY/water and (3) -the CsMFI/ water system. Il all cases the samples (12 to 14 for each series) correspond to powder filled glasscapillaries heated and sealed at increasing temperatures in order to obtain, at room temperature after equilibration (2 weeks), several hydration degrees. For systems (2) and (3) ESRF Reports have already been deposited. Accordingly, the present report is restricted to preliminary results concerning the structural evolution of a Na 58 Y/water system during dehydration.</p><p>The labelling of the cationic Na sites in FAU type zeolites is given in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> the migration of the Na cations versus water fillings is represented. These results represent the very first example of a complete description of the structural evolution at RT of a zeolitic sorbent/water system. The water molecules are located on five distinct sites and the distribution of their populations versus water fillings is presently established. The most unexpected result is the presence of the NaIII' site (blue tringles) at all water fillings except at total dehydration. Once again it must be emphasized that figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> represents the Na miration at room temperature in progressively dehydrated Na 58 Y/water samples : in fact, in the case of rehydrated samples at room temperature calorimetric results seem to show that the structural evolution is quite different. Therefore, a continuation experiment concerning progressively rehydrated samples has to be performed.
