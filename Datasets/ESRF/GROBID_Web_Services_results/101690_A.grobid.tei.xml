<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Objective and expected results: Vanadium spinel oxide has been intensively investigated as one of the forefront topics in modern orbital physics and its potential benefits for new technologies. FeV 2 O 4 (= FVO) is a unique compound since both Fe 2+ and V 3+ ions have orbital degrees of freedom, bringing about orbital-ordered states in the material. This orbital ordering can be retrieved by characterising the polyhedral distortions, for which the precise location of the oxygen atoms is crucial. While FVO's orbital ordering has widely been studied in bulk form, it has not been proven for thin films. However, precisely locating oxygen atoms in nanosized systems is a real challenge. The traditional strategies used for bulk samples fail in probing those with much less matter. Resonant Elastic X-ray Scattering (REXS) experiments in the Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) domain have been proven successful in indirectly locating oxygen atoms in thin films. Therefore, we aim at using REXS-EXAFS to precisely locate oxygen atoms at different temperatures, in order to study the temperature evolution of the orbital ordering of FVO thin films.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental :</head><p>Resonant Elastic X-ray Scattering experiments were perfomed on the D2AM beamline equiped with a cryofurnace. The ~ 40 nm thick FVO thin films samples, have been deposited by pulsed laser deposition either onto a SrTiO 3 (001) substrate or onto a MgO(001) substrates. They were placed inside a Be dome specimen holder evacuated down to 10 -6 mbar (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), and maintained to a fixed temperatures, between 300 and 20 K, by an ARS compressor. Some resonant diffraction spectra were acquired at the Fe K-edges, over the 7.070-7.370 keV energy ranges, for about different reflections chosen for their sensitivity to the positions of the oxygens in the cell, at 8 different temperatures <ref type="bibr">(300, 200, 150, 120, 100, 70, 40, and 20 K)</ref>. In addition, reciprocal space mapping of the 008 node have been made for each temperature. Preliminary Results and Conclusions: a) Structural transition a low temperature</p><p>We observed the splitting of the 008 node at low temperature for the FVO\MgO thin film (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) which may be due to a cubic to monoclinic transition. This structural transition, which had not been evidenced up to now, seems to occur alongside the already-knozn magnetic transition in our material. This splitting has not observed for the FVO\STO thin film. The study of the different RSM will allow us to compute the unit cell parameters of this new structure. Figure 3 : REXS spectra of the 115 node of FVO\STO REXS spectra were recorded for all the samples at different temperatures. As an illustration, some of the experimental spectra acquired for various temperatures, at the Fe K-edges for the 115 reflection of FVO\STO are shown in the figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The signal is probably partly absorbed by the Be dome but one can however clearly observe distinct features on the spectra. The spectra will be fitted with the FitREXS and FDMNES codes, in order to determine the cationic distribution within the two cationic sites, and the positions of the anions for each temperature. After a long analysis procedure, the large set of data should thus give conclusions on the positions of the atoms, and therefore on the possible temperature-dependent lattice distortions. This will reveal whether the material posseses an orbital ordering in the thin film form or not, as well as its evolution whitin temperature. The fluorescence of three standards was recorded in order to evidence the iron oxidation state in the different characterised samples (figure 4 left) . Those were metallic iron (Fe 0 ), ferrous oxalate (Fe +II ) and hematite (Fe +III ). The first analysis of theses spectra allows to draw up the iron oxidation state as a function of the edge (figure 4 right). This graph will be essential for the determination of the iron oxidation state in the different studied thin films.</p></div>
