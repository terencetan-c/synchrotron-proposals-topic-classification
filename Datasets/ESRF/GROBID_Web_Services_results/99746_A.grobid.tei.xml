<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type A. Real-time crystallization</head><p>In this type of experiment, the triglyceride (TAG) dilution was added into a capillary and placed on the Linkam stage. The stage was set to 80°C for 15 minutes, and then the adequate crystallization profile was conducted (e.g., cool to X °C at Y°C/min). Time-resolved WAXS-SAXS and WAXS-USAXS were acquired during the phase transition. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> presents the experiments that were successfully registered.</p><p>Table 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Type B. Static acquisitionpilot scale experiments</head><p>In this type of experiment, the samples were prepared in Belgium (Ghent University). Employing a pilot-scale scraped surface heat exchanger, samples were prepared with different shearing and cooling rates. These experiments are quite relevant from an application standpoint, as the setup mimics the industrial processing of shortenings. The samples were placed inside a metal ring with two Kapton tapes. For measurement, the metal ring containing the sample was placed on top of a Peltier cooled stage at the required measuring temperature (15°C). WAXS-SAXS and WAXS-USAXS were acquired.</p><p>Two different designs of experiments (DoE) were measured in line (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>(A) (B) With the results of the first DoE (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>), the influence of the following parameters can be assessed:</p><p>• Concentration • Presence/absence of a pin worker (C unit)</p><p>• Outlet temperaturelinked to the degree of undercooling.</p><p>With the results of the second DoE (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>), the influence of industrially relevant shearing protocols can be assessed:</p><p>• A unit (Scraped surface heat exchanger)</p><p>• C unit (Pin worker) Both of which have a direct effect on cooling and shearing rate.</p><p>Additional techniques used in this setup include rheology, texture analysis, polarized light microscopy and Cryo-SEM. At the moment, advanced statistical methods are being used to address relationships between USAXS, SAXS and WAXS and Macroscopic product behavior.</p><p>Due to the confidentiality of the results, no further declarations would be made regarding the findings. Publications in progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
