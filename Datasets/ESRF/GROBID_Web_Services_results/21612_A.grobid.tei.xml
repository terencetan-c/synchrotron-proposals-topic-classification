<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5HSRUW</head><p>During polymer processing the crystallization of a material gives rise to its mechanical and aesthetic properties. Studying the relationship between crystallization and structure development in materials is an important and major aspect of the polymer processing industry. Thus, gaining a deep understanding of the process allows greater contol and so aiding the development of new application specific materials in the future. Following the crystallization of sem-crystalline polymers has been easily performed using simulatneous SAXS/WAXS techniques and Rheology. However, following the rheological responses of a polymer system during crytsallization simultaneously with SAXS/WAXS has not been attempted until now and is usually done separatley using off-line Rheometers and SAXS/WAXS at synchrotron X-ray sources where it is difficult to link the time resolution and validity of data collected. Here, a system has been developed on ID02 where simutaneous SAXS/WAXS/Rheology of the crystallization of Polyethylenes has been performed. This has enabled the long range structural ordering from SAXS with unit cell/crystallinity information from WAXS to be coupled with the rheological data to be collected simultaneously for the crystallization of model polyethylene systems. Experimentally, a couette geometry system has been used controlled by a Haake Rheometer, which records the rheological responses during crystallization being synchronized with the recording of SAXS/WAXS data from two CCD detectors. The experimental set-up is show in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, for example, details some of the data taken from the crytsallization of a mono disperse sample of hydrogenated polybutadiene (hPBD50k) blended with a similar sample containing long chain branching (comb10). Here, the sample was crystallized at 105 o C having been quenched from the melt. The SAXS/WAXS and Rheology was recorded throughout the crystallization process. This expeimental set-up has enabled crystallization studies of specially synthesised polyethylenes to be followed. The great advantage here, is that the samples which have differening architectures can have profound effects upon the rheology of the materials thus, recording the rheology simultaneously with the scattering allows valuble processing information to be gained and the effects that unique architectures have on the macro-and micro-structure as well as the overal crystallization kinetics.</p><p>&amp;RXHWWH VDPSOH FHOO +DDNH 5KHRPHWHU P HYDFXDWHG 6$;6 EHDP ,QFLGHQW ;UD\V 6$;6 &amp;&amp;' :$;6 &amp;&amp;' W W PLQ W PLQ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0.05 0.15 0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 0.65 Ã D Ã t = 0 t = 22 min t = 32 min t = 52 min t= 92 min t = 132 min t = 172 min 0.0 1000.0 2000.0 3000.0 4000.0 5000.0 6000.0 0.0 1x10 5 2x10 5 3x10 5 4x10 5 5x10 5 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 time [s] G' ( ) [Pa] G" ( ) [Pa] tan_delta ( ) [ ] ÃB ÃBÅ Ãhfqr yh :$;6 6$;6 5KHRORJ\</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>)</head><figDesc>LJXUH 6$;6:$;65KHRORJ\ H[SHULPHQWDO VHWXS RQ ,' )LJXUH 6$;6:$;6 5KHRORJ\ GXULQJ FU\VWDOOL]DWLRQ RI K3%'N FRPE DW R &amp;</figDesc></figure>
