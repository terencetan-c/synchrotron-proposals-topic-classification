Several large placoderm (Romundina) scales were imaged at 1.4µm with half-acquisition mode, in order to get full view of the speciemens. The we used 0.678µm resolution to image other types of scales, including some representitive acanthodians and early osteichthyans. The crown part of placoderm scales were also imaged at 0.678µm.</p><p>The scan session allows us to start building up the dataset to study the growth patterns of polyodontode scales of early jawed vertebrates. It further proves that the PPC-SRμCT is the best tool to study the 3D histology of vertebrate microfossils at high resolution. The growth model of the Andreolepis (early bony fish) scale has been reconstructed and the related paper has recently been published. The Psarolepis scale model and an acanthodian scales model have been partially finished and the two papers are in preparation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publication abstract:</head><p>Qu Q, Sanchez S, Blom H, Tafforeau P, Ahlberg PE (2013) Scales and Tooth Whorls of Ancient Fishes Challenge Distinction between External and Oral 'Teeth'. PLoS ONE 8(8): e71890. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0071890</p><p>The debate about the origin of the vertebrate dentition has been given fresh fuel by new fossil discoveries and developmental studies of extant animals. Odontodes (teeth or toothlike structures) can be found in two distinct regions, the 'internal' oropharyngeal cavity and the 'external' skin. A recent hypothesis argues that regularly patterned odontodes is a specific oropharyngeal feature, whereas odontodes in the external skeleton lack this organization. However, this argument relies on the skeletal system of modern chondrichthyans (sharks and their relatives), which differ from other gnathostome (jawed vertebrate) groups in not having dermal bones associated with the odontodes. Their external skeleton is also composed of monoodontode 'placoid scales', whereas the scales of most early fossil gnathostomes are polyodontode, i.e. constructed from several odontodes on a shared bony base. Propagation phase contrast X-ray Synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SRmCT) is used to study the polyodontode scales of the early bony fish Andreolepis hedei.</p><p>The odontodes constructing a single scale are reconstructed in 3D, and a linear and regular growth mechanism similar to that in a gnathostome dentition is confirmed, together with a second, gap-filling growth mechanism (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These results contradict the hypothesis that oropharyngeal and external odontode skeletons are fundamentally separate and suggest that the importance of dermal bone interactions to odontode patterning has been underestimated. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. The reconstructed growth pattern of odontodes in the scanned scale of Andreolepis, crown view. A-J. The referred sequential addition of odontodes ① -⑪ in the crown of the scale. The first generation odontodes (odontodes ① -⑤, see text) form a growth series, but the other younger odontodes (⑥ -⑭) do not necessarily fall neatly into the same sequence even though they generally continue to get larger; the yellow horizontal vascular canal system is used as landmark to show the positions of the odontodes K. Crown view of the scale with buried odontodes, showing the actual surface composition of the scale. Note that the most dorsal denticles compose the enamel layers from both odontode ⑨ and ⑫, odontode ⑨ is partially overlapped by ⑫; odontode ⑩ is only overlapped by ⑫ and ⑬ posteriorly and exposed to the surface otherwise.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,61.07,45.27,479.05,410.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
