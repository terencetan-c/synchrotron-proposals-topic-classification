<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>RBC have been prepared and characterized at the University of Palermo.</p><p>"Smooth" and "healthy" cells have been obtained by properly choosing the salt concentrations. To avoid problems with the precipitations of the cells during the data collection we have waited for the cell to sediment and used an orthogonal pump-probe beam geometry with the laser beam coming from below (see fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> This ensured a stable concentration of cells during the experiment. At the beginning of the experiment we had some problem with a fast x-ray induced deterioration of the cells resulting in a loss of signal to the Hb. This has been solved changing the preparation protocol (see figure in the next page)</p><p>The data have been reduced (from the CCD images to averaged difference curves) while collecting data using programs available at ID09B. Indeed the disappearance of the peak at around 0.45 Å-1 can be taken as fingerprint of the quaternary transition of Hb. According to this very rough analysis it seems to happen later with respect to the solution case. The lower photolysis fraction could be a partial reason for it and a more detailed analysis will follow.</p><p>Bibliography 1 M. Cammarata, M. Levantino, F. Schotte, P.A. Anfinrud, F. Ewald, J.
