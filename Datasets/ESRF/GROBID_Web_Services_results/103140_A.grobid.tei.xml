<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aims of the proposed experiments were the synthesis of new Sc-N compounds at multimegabar pressure, characterization of their crystal chemistry and compressional behavior, tests of theoretical predictions, and search for regularities in polynitrogen chemistry.</p><p>The diamond anvil cells, containing a sample composed of scandium pieces embedded into molecular nitrogen, were compressed to 78, 96, and 125 GPa and laser-heated to 2500 K. The precise 2D X-ray diffraction map, collected with a step of 0.75 µm at ID11 ESRF beamline from the heated area, revealed the crystallization of novel phases and allowed to pinpoint the location of crystallites most appropriate for single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). Highquality synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were then collected from the sample. The subsequent crystal structure solution and refinement revealed the formation of four novel Sc-N phases -Sc2N6, Sc2N8, ScN5, and Sc4N3at pressures between 78 and 125 GPa. Nitrogen-rich scandium polynitrides Sc2N6, Sc2N8, and ScN5 demonstrate a unique nitrogen catenation: they feature N6 units, N8 units, and 2D polynitrogen</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(N 5 3-) ∞ 2</formula><p>layers consisting of N12 fused rings, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). The discovery of such catenated nitrogen units gives an insight into the possible ways of nitrogen catenation depending on the pressure, significantly extends the chemistry of polynitrides, and may have an impact on general organic and inorganic chemistry. One can expect that the N6 and N8 units will be stabilized at ambient conditions in the future, considering a positive example of the N5 -anion. It may not only open access to novel high-energy density materials but also to analogues of Li-and Mg-metalorganic compounds that are currently widely used in organic synthesis. N6 and N8 units, if used as building blocks in organic chemistry, may provide new routes for the targeted synthesis of novel N-heteroatomic organic, metalorganic, and coordination compounds.</p><p>The fruitful results of this experiment have been submitted to Nature Chemistry and the manuscript is under review now: A.
