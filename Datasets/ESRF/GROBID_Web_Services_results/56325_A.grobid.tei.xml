<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Mössbauer spectra of the binary alloy and ternary quasiordered Fe 65 Al 35-x М x and Fe 65-y Al 35 M y alloys (x, y = 5, 10 at.%) were measured at variable temperature (3.3 -80 K) and magnetic field (0 -7 T). The form of the spectra is typical for systems with some degree of chemical disorder inherent in superstructure of non-stoichiometric composition. The average hyperfine magnetic field (HMF) at various temperature calculated from the 57 Fe HMF distributions р(B hf ) is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. B hf (T) dependences of three systems: Fe 65 Al 35 , Fe 65 Al 30 Ga 5 and Fe 60 Al 35 Mn 5 are similar. One can see a sharp collapse of the high-field magnetic components of spectrum starting with 30-40 K and followed by relatively slow decrease of a low-field magnetic splitting above 80K. These dependencies can be described by two functions Brillouin type, belonging to different magnetic phases with different values of magnetic ordering temperature and B hf (0). The B hf (T) dependence for the Fe 65 Al 30 B 5 alloy is closest in their behavior to the systems with a ferromagnetic ordering, but there is the segment in the curve near 40K, indicating that not a single magnetic phase is presented in the alloy.</p><p>Mössbauer spectra of the Fe 65 Al 35 alloy at Т = 5K in external magnetic field were measured according to the scheme 0.1 T → 2.5 T → 0.1T. A comparison of the spectra did not reveal any significant differences neither in their shape nor in the average HMF.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Analysis of a series of in-field Mössbauer spectra clearly showed that the spectra contain components with an effective HMF, which decreases with the increase of external magnetic field <ref type="bibr">(Fig 2.)</ref>. That is, these components correspond to the probe atoms whose magnetic moments are ordered ferromagnetically. The values of the 57 Fe effective HMF of these components are arranged in the interval [15.0÷33.0 T] and are close to the field values for some local configurations of probe atom in the ordered Fe-Al alloys <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Comparison of HMF distributions (calculated using SpectrRelax [2]) for spectra, measured without an external magnetic field and in the magnetic field, proves that there are components in the spectra, demonstrating the behavior in the field, not typical for ferromagnetic ordering of magnetic moments (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The values of the effective HMF of these components are arranged in the interval [0÷15.0-17.5 T]. From these considerations the model of magnetic microstructure was developed. The Mössbauer spectrum is represented as a superposition of a set of discrete components (related to a probe atom in a certain local environment) and of the contribution from the resonance of atoms whose magnetic moments form an incommensurate spin density wave. Correct processing of the Mössbauer spectra in context of this model is a nontrivial problem and requires detailed validation.</p><p>Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis of the alloys showed that the influence of sp-admixtures on is essentially different: adding Ga to the initial binary alloy results in a slight increase in the average 57 Fe HMF, whereas addition of 5 at % of boron to the initial alloy Fe 65 Al 35 makes grow the average HMF of 57 Fe considerably, from 14.0 to 20.0 T. The same is observed for 3d-admixtures: replacing Fe with V in ternary alloy Fe 65-х V x Al 35 leads to collapse of weak hyperfine magnetic splitting. Insertion of Mn atoms into the initial alloy results in an increase of hyperfine magnetic splitting and disappearance of the nonmagnetic component.  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Fe 65 Al 30 Ga 5 (5K) Fe 65 Al 30 Ga 5 (5K, 5T) p(B hf ), arb.units Effective hyperfine magnetic field B hf , T 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Fe 65 Al 30 B 5 (5K) Fe 65 Al 30 B 5 (5K, 5T) p(B hf ), arb.units Effective hyperfine magnetic field B hf , T Fig 2. p(B hf ) distributions for the spectra of the Fe 65 Al 30 Ga 5 and Fe 65 Al 30 B 5 alloys measured at T=5K and at T=5K, under magnetic field H=5T. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>1.
