<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>New Report:</p><p>In the first year of the long-term project we had used only 6 shifts from the 30 allocated. This delay was caused by a) the long-time unsuccessful negotiations with two suppliers asked to fulfil our technical requirements for the synchrotron laminography set-up, b) a considerable effort devoted to the development of the adequate simulation and reconstruction programs. At the time being, all these difficulties are overcome (negotiations with the companies HUBER and AZ-Systèmes of the final contract are in a final stage and programs are available). The new set-up will presumably be implemented on the ID19 beamline at the end of the year 2004.</p><p>In the second allocation of beam-time for MI-576, further test experiments on the prototype sample manipulator (as already described in the first report) for synchrotron laminography (SL) were carried out. As for the first experiments of May 2002, the alignment procedure was difficult and time consuming. It was carried out with a 50 µm thick W wire and a Cu mesh (i.e. a Cu mesh 351", corresponding to a periodicity of 73 µm). The final sample manipulator is conceived to facilitate the alignment procedure by stringent requirements on the perpendicularity of the axes. Working energies were 14.7 keV and 35 keV obtained using wiggler radiation and multilayer as a monochromator. The detector used was FReLoN camera with 2048×2048 pixels, having pixel size of 1.4 µm with a resulting field of view of width 2.87 mm. A variety of samples was investigated performing the laminography scans, i.e. the tomography-like projection data sets were recorded when rotating the sample by 360º. The typical parameters of the scans were: 900 images, measuring time 3 s/image, step 0.4°, distance sample-to-scintillator 26 mm.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> show an example of obtained data, it corresponds to a single projection image of a flip-chip bonded device.</p><p>The implemented laminographic reconstruction program was employed to reconstruct 3 dimensional data sets which give evidence of the sample structures. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> exhibits two mutually perpendicular slice through solder bumps of the flip-chip bonding. Voids in the 80 to 100 µm thick solder bumps are clearly visible. Furthermore, we see the faint outline of the Si chip and pores in the printed circuit board. The corresponding reconstructed 3 dimensianal rendering is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.</p><p>The experiments have encouraged our decision to invest in a dedicated laminographic manipulator. If the required precision can be met, an image quality better than currently available by laboratory laminographic setups is expected. Futher methodic advantages are likely to arise from the use of phase contrast imaging exploiting partially coherent synchrotron radiation. 180 µm Fig. 3: 3 dimensional renditions of the reconstructed segmented solder bumps of the flip-chip device.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fraunhofer Institut IZFP EADQ, Dresden, Germany P.
