<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>The rich elemental composition, surface chemistry, and outstanding electrical conductivity of MXenes make them a promising class of two-dimensional (2D) materials for electrochemical energy storage. To translate these properties into high performance devices, it is essential to develop fabrication strategies that allow MXenes to be assembled into electrodes with tunable architectures and investigate the effect of their pore structure on the capacitive performance. Here, we report on the fabrication of MXene aerogels with highly ordered lamellar structures by unidirectional freeze-casting of additive-free Ti3C2Tx aqueous suspensions. These structures can be subsequently processed into practical supercapacitor electrode films by pressing or calendering steps. This versatile processing route allows a wide control of film thickness, spacing within lamellae (to give electrolyte accessible sites), and densities (over 2 orders of magnitude) and hence gives control over the final properties. The as-prepared MXene aerogel with a density of 13 mg cm -3 achieves 380 F g -1 capacitance at 2 mV s -1 and 75 F g -1 at 50 mV s -1 . The calendering of the MXene aerogel into a porous 60 μm thick film with a density of 434 mg cm -3 leads to a superior rate capability of 309 F g -1 at 50 mV s -1 . In addition, the rolled electrodes present an improvement in volumetric capacitance of 104 times as compared to the as-prepared MXene aerogel. Finally, the outstanding cyclability of rolled electrodes strengthens their nomination for supercapacitor applications. In this paper we demonstrate the possibilities in tuning the porosity and the electrochemical properties of aerogels highlighting the importance of evaluating new and hybrid processing methods to develop energy storage applications. The simplicity and versatility of the developed fabrication strategy open opportunities for the utilization of MXene lamellae architectures in a wide range of applications requiring controlled porosity including catalysis, filtration, and water purification.</p></div>

Tailoring the Microstructure of Lamellar Ti3C2Tx MXene Aerogel by Compressive Straining. ACS <ref type="bibr">Nano, 16(2), pp.1896</ref><ref type="bibr">Nano, 16(2), pp. -1908</ref><ref type="bibr">Nano, 16(2), pp. . 2022. .</ref> Abstract: Aerogels are attracting increasing interest due to their functional properties, such as lightweight and high porosity, which make them promising materials for energy storage and advanced composites. Compressive deformation allows the nano-and microstructure of lamellar freeze-cast aerogels to be tailored toward the aforementioned applications, where a 3D nanostructure of closely spaced, aligned sheets is desired. Quantitatively characterizing their microstructural evolution during compression is needed to allow optimization of manufacturing, understand in-service structural changes, and determine how aerogel structure relates to functional properties. Herein we have developed methods to quantitatively analyze lamellar aerogel domains, sheet spacing, and sheet orientation in 3D and to track their evolution as a function of increasing compression through synchrotron phase contrast X-ray microcomputed tomography (μCT). The as-cast domains are predominantly aligned with the freezing direction with random orientation in the orthogonal plane. Generally the sheets rotate toward flat and their spacing narrows progressively with increasing compression with negligible lateral strain (zero Poisson's ratio). This is with the exception of sheets close to parallel with the loading direction (Z), which maintain their orientation and sheet spacing until ∼60% compression, beyond which they exhibit buckling. These data suggest that a single-domain, fully aligned as-cast aerogel is not necessary to produce a post-compression aligned lamellar structure and indicate how the spacing can be tailored as a function of compressive strain. The analysis methods presented herein are applicable to optimizing freeze-casting process and quantifying lamellar microdomain structures generally.</p></div>			</div>
