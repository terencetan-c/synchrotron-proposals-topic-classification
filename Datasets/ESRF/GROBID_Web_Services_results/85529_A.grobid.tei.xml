<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment number:</head><p>HC-3411</p><p>Beamline: Date of experiment: <ref type="bibr">from: 22.11.2017 to: 28.11.2018</ref> Date of report:  Left paned of Fig. 1 illustrates the observation of arc-like features and diffuse intensity spots, presumably both related to Fermi surface nesting features. Right panels of Fig. 1 shows the intensity evolution in the proximity of modulation spots. Remarkably, the intensity around 3kq1 spreads along b* both above and below the transition temperature TC1, in line with the observation of phonon softening by M. Maschek et al. [1]. Remarkably, maximum of diffuse intensity is also observed in q2 positions. Here |q1|~0.3c* and |q2|~0.3a*</p><p>Qualitative analysis of satellite intensities in low-temperature phase, including combined satellites, indicates that the low temperature modulation vector is rather (q2 1 0) than previously reported (q2 0 0). Otherwise, it can be accomodated by centering in 5D superspace group.</p><p>Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate IXS data taken in this experiment revealing the absence of softening at the approach of the phase transition. This result is in complete contradiction with that published in <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. As a result we have decided to explore the phonon excitations in more details in order to gather a clear cut picture. The effect of the electric field on the charge density wave excitations is left to a forthcoming continuation proposal.  The current dependency of diffuse scattering in TbTe3 was measured at ambient conditions employing compact setup shown on Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The sliding of charge density waves was observed in current-voltage characteristics, though the effects on the diffuse scattering remain inconclusive, resulting from current-induced heating.</p><p>Next step of present work is the CDW sliding study on GdTe3, where TC1 ~380 K is well above ambient temperature and thus current heating can be nearly neglected.</p><p>[1] M.

Contrary to what has been stated in[1]  the measured profiles can be well accounted for by an increasing of the phonon damping rather than by the occurrence of a soft mode.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,60.00,309.10,250.90,187.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
