			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A novel promoter material 10-Mg-Fe-Al-O showed remarkable stability and high CO yield towards a CO 2 utilization process [1]. The structural evolution during the reaction was investigated using in situ XRD, however no noticeable changes in the evolution of various iron oxide phases were observed. Hence, a detailed in situ XAS study was conducted on this material to identify the changes in oxidation state of iron oxides by probing around the Fe environment. The XAS study was performed along with in situ XRD study which could follow crystallographic changes in a six degree window. This could yield insight about the possible extraction of Fe through the lattice parameter evolution. The in situ XAS and XRD can provide information about the oxidation state evolution along with changes in local structure.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>XAS measurements were performed at the Fe-K edge (7112 eV) in transmission mode. The redox properties of 10-Mg-Fe-Al-O were studied during H 2 reduction (up to 800 o C), CO 2 reoxidation (up to 800째C). In situ XANES was performed to follow the oxidation state changes during these treatments. Further, EXAFS measurements were recorded before reaction, and at selected stages of treatments (after reduction and reoxidation). These steps will allow for modeling and hence supply quantitative structural information. In addition, EXAFS was measured at -196째C using a cryostat for selected samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed and results</head><p>The oxidation state evolution was identified during XANES at Fe-K edge in 10-Mg-Fe-Al-O for fresh and 60 times cycled material during H 2 -TPR and CO 2 -TPO. The XANES of fresh material shows that during H 2 -TPR a shift of edge and pre-edge occurred, indicating reduction, but the iron oxide was not completely reduced to metallic Fe (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>). The XANES evolution during the CO 2 -TPO (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) show that the material was oxidized back to its as prepared state (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). (a) (b)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fe foil</head><p>The diffraction changes were followed during reduction and reoxidation in a six degree window around the main spinel diffraction position. They show a slight decrease in lattice parameter during H 2 -TPR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>). In addition to thermal expansion, which gives rise to a downward shift of diffractions, the observed shift in TPR could point to reduction and/or Fe extraction from the spinel lattice. A more complex variation occurs during CO 2 -TPO. Further, for the 60 times cycled sample, a room temperature XANES spectrum after H 2 -TPR and CO 2 -TPO shows that the material did not oxidize back to the as prepared state (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). This could be due to the prolonged cycling which could result in deactivation. Comparison with references of Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 show that these materials are electronically different. The pre-edge features show that in both fresh and cycled material Fe is distributed in octahedral and tetrahedral sites, as they exhibit sharper preedge peaks. EXAFS of fresh and 60 times cycled sample at -196째C, yield k-space features (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>) with clear structural differences from the reference materials (Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 ). Further analysis of the pre-edge features and the k-space signals will allow for detailed modelling of the second shell, which will yield structural insight in the material.
