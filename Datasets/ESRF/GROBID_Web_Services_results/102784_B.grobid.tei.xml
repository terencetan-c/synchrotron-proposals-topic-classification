<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Many samples were successfully measured at ESRF. Here, we will focus only on a few samples to highlight the success of the measurements. The polymers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) are polyacrylamides with DP = 200 randomly functionalized with side-chains. Benzene-tricarboxamide in red, coumarin as cross-linkable unit in green, and dodecylamine are the hydrophobic grafts, and the relatively bulky Jeffamine@M1000 graft is the hydrophilic moiety. Here, we highlighy three polymers functionalized from the same backbone. P4 incorporates all different grafts, P3 lacks coumarin grafts, and P7, incorporates exclusively the hydrophilic graft Jeffamine@M1000. The DPs are twice as large as used for previously studies amphiphilic polymers, 2,3 which showed a strong effect on the particle shape. Cross-linking of P4 into P4_PW1 occured via dimerization of the coumarin moieties using UV-light (λ = 365 nm). The polymers are dissolved and subsequently cross-linked in water.</p><p>All scattering curves were fitted with a worm-like chain model, which describes the polymers as semi-flexible polymers. The agreement between the model and the obtained data is high, as χ2 is close to 1 for all models.  Spherical, ellipsoidal, or Gaussian coil models can not succesfully fit the obtained SAXS curves. These models were tried by others on similar systems in the past. 2,4 Hence, our polymers behave distinctly different.</p><p>The scattering curves of P3, P4, P7, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> (left), reveals that the length (50 -70 nm, consistent with polymer contour length), flexibility (lk = 9 -10 nm), and radii (2.5 -2.8 nm), are very comparable between the samples. Hence, the graft composition does not seem to influence the polymer dimensions much. This notion strengthens the idea that the hydrophobic grafts form small, local hydrophobic pockets, but do not result in macroscopic collapse of the polymer chain. Instead, the high incorporation density of bulky Jeffamine@M1000 grafts dictates the shape of the polymer. This could not be determined using other analysis techniques we have used before, such as light scattering. Absolute scale fitting revealed that the polymers are present as single chains in solution.</p><p>Coumarin dimerization of P4 into P4_PW1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> right) results in a decrease of the chain length and radius, indicating that smaller particles are formed. Additionally, the upturn at low q observed for P4_PW1 indicates the presence of a small amount of larger aggregates, consistent with previous size exclusion chromatography results, and was fitted using an additive power law model. Whereas the cross-linking is mostly intramolecular in nature, there might be small amounts of intermolecular cross-linking. The presence of aggregates hinders the use of absolute scale fitting to determine the polymer aggregation number. We therefore performed SEC-SAXS, but due to dilution on the column, the signal-to-noise ratio was poor. For future SEC-SAXS experiments, we will have to increase the polymer concentration by three-to-four fold to get satisfactory statistics. Coupled with the UV-detector, this will additionally allow absolute scale fitting of the data for samples containing small amounts of aggregates.</p><p>In summary, the current experiment was successful and the high quality data allowed for absolute scale form factor fitting to a worm-like chain model. These new insight will help us rationalize the catalytic activity of the polymers.</p><p>Literature 1) G. ter Huurne et al., CCS Chem. 2019, 1, 64. 2) G. ter Huurne et al., Macromolecules 2015, 48, 3949. 3) G. ter Huurne et al., Macromolecules 2017, 50, 8562. 4) P.
