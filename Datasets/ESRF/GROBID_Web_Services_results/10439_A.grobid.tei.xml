<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>l-Introduction</head><p>The study of the ternary boride CeRh3Bz is of great importance because of its exceptional ferromagnetic state. One of the most surprising feature is that the Curie temperature is unusually large (T,= 115 K) for a Ce compound without 3d magnetic constituents [ 11. Magnetisation measurements show that the saturation moment is only about 0.5-0.4&amp;m <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>: this is much smaller than the free-ion value and has been attributed to large crystal effects and/or a Kondo type interaction <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>.</p><p>The structural properties of CeRh3B2 seem also anomalous: CeRh3B2 crystallises in a distorted hexagonal p6lmmm CeCosB&amp;ke structure, with a= 5.484 h; and c= 3.087 A; this latter value is the shortest never observed in intermetallic Ce compounds. The linear thermal expansion is large and highly anisotropic : along the a axis the expansion is nearly temperature dependent whereas along the c axis the expansion is three time larger than in an usual metal [ 51.</p><p>Postal address: User Office, ESRF, B.P. 220, F-38043 GRENOBLE Cedex, France.</p><p>Telephone: (33) 76 88 25 52; Fax: (33) 76 88 20 20; e-mail:</p><p>To precise the role played by the 4f and 4d electrons in the magnetic properties of CeRh3Bp, we present in this paper x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) experiments at the Ce and Rh L2,3 edges. The comparison of the spectra with those obtained from some reference systems evidence the itinerant behaviour of the 4f electrons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2-Results and discussion</head><p>The Ce and Rh L2,~ XAS measurements were carried out at the ESRF beam-line ID 12A in the total fluorescence detection mode. The XMCD signal was monitored by keeping the helicity of the incoming x-rays fixed and flipping the direction of the applied magnetic field. The XAS spectra presented here are recorded with the incoming light parallel to the direction of the applied magnetic field (2T) and perpendicular to the c axis, i.e. parallel to the easy axis of the magnetisation, at T= 10K.</p><p>As a first approach in the understanding of the magnetic properties of CeRh3B2, one could expect that the high Curie temperature result from the Rh-4d electrons. However, our own XMCD experiments performed at the Rh-L2,3 edges exclude this assumption (Ma I 0.004urJ. This result is in agreement with both valence-band photoemission and recent polarised neutron diffraction measurements <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p><p>We now discuss results obtained from measurements at the Ce-L2,3 and show that the character of the 4f states are intermediate to that found in strong localised and well delocalised Ce compound.</p><p>In highly correlated systems the Ce-L2,3 absorption edges may present a satellite located at about 10 eV above the main white line. This structure can be interpreted either as a "shake up" or the signature of a 4J" configuration in the ground state (the 4f electrons interact strongly with the 2p core holes leading to 2ps4$Wi and 2ps4f5&amp;' final states <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>). The interpretation of the satellite is far from trivial; however the Ce-M,, edges also show a weak satellite. This suggests that the structure (not observed for trivalent Ce compounds such as CeRu*Ge$ results from a 4$ configuration. Consequently, the 5d-4f hybridisation is certainly non negligible in CeRh3Bz. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates the XMCD response at the Ce-&amp; edges for CeRu2Gez (T,=SK), CeRh3Bz (T,=llOK) and CeFe2 a (T,=220K). The presence of signal reveals the existence of a 5d polarisation. The large palette of magnetic signais observed shows that the 5d XVCD is very sensitive to the Ce ground state. For CeRuzGez, where the 44 localised character is undisputed, the XMCD signals are characterised by a negative (positive) signal at the L3 (L2), The signs of the integrated intensity are opposite to that expected from the oneparticle model.</p><p>Moreover, the branching ratio (+2), is far away from the -1 value expected by the &amp; edges band structure and corresponding to a pure spin contribution. Such dichroic signals, always observed for well localised 4jr systems, are taken as a reference for weak Kondo temperature systems <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9]</ref>. In contrast, for CeFez both the sign and the branching ratio of XMCD are in accordance with the one-particle model, in agreement with the small Ce-4f moment contribution and then with the itinerant 5d band character, without orbital contribution. The unusual XMCD observed in CeRh3B2, which can be interpreted as a combination of that observed in CeFe? and CeRuzG@, demonstrates the importance of the 4f hybridisation in the peculiar properties of CeRh3B1. Indeed, the arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrate the possible correspondence of the main XMCD structures of CeFe;? and those of CeRh3B2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3-Conclusions</head><p>In conclusion, the XMCD signals in CeRh3Bz suggest that the 4f does not reach the high degree observed in CeRuzGez due to 5d-4f hybridisation. This result is in agreement with the additional features observed in Ce-k&amp; absorption edges.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. l -</head><label>l</label><figDesc>Fig. l-Ce-L,, edges in CeRh3B2, CeRu2Ge2 and CeFe2 (from ref. 8).
