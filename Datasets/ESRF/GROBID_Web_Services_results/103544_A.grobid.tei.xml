<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>1. Overview The objective of the experiments were to explore the unknown damage mechanisms occurring during cavitation erosion with a strong focus on dynamic phenomena using X-ray tomography on ID19 beamline. Cavitation erosion is one of the main damaging mode occurring on hydroelectric turbines. Understanding the cracking mechanisms occurring in stainless steel exposed to cavitation erosion is hence a strategic concern within the scope of energetic transition. The initiation and propagation of cracks leading to mass loss will be monitored insitu using a unique homemade apparatus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Measurement</head><p>The experiment took place from the 18 th to the 21 st of April 2023 on ID19 beam line. The studied materials were two strategic grades of stainless steel (X3CrNiMo13-4 and X4CrNiMo16-5-1) mainly used for manufacturing hydroelectric turbine blades. Each grades were investigated in two different heat-treated conditions (QT760/QT780 and QT900) in order to understand the influence of the local hardness. The specimen scanned were cylindrical samples of 4 mm in diameter. The experiment was performed at an energy of 70 keV with an exposure time 0.2 s. The voxel size for this experiment is approximately 0,32 µm. Three types of analysis were made during this experiment:</p><p> Post-mortem scans. Before to ESRF experiment, specimen were damaged using an ultrasonic horn at different exposure time for the four grades. These specimen were scanned in order to estimate the exposure time to cavitation requiered for observing cracks using X-ray tomography.  Long exposure time in-situ scans. The four grades were scanned from texposure = 0 min to texposure = 120 min by steps of 10 min for monitoring cracks propagation.</p></div>

Three of the four grades were scanned from texposure = 120 min to texposure = 136 min by steps of 1 min for having accurate crack propagation monitoring.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Result</head><p>All in-situ experiment 3d volumes are already all reconstructed and segmented to distinguish stainless steel and cracks as shown on figure 2. The main information extracted from these scans is the evolution of the crack in the material with the exposure time to cavitation. We conclude that the cracks propagate from the surface to the volume. The non metallic elements seem to have a minor influence on crack propagation. As shown on figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, cracks seem to propagate perpendiculary to the surface. 70 min 80 min 90 min 100 min Figure 2: 3D reconstruction of cracks (in blue) propagating in the specimen (grade X4CrNiMo16-5-1 QT760).
