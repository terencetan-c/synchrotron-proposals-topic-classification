<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Five samples of SN from four deceased-donors affected by PD and one age-matched control were imaged at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The whole SN was acquired at a resolution of 3 and 0.6 microns. Then, targeted regions were imaged at a resolution of 50 nanometers. No contrast agent was used in this study. All samples came from deceased donors. The bodies were treated with respect and respecting the French funerary legislation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The experiment went well, without troubles during the data acquisition. Targeting of neuromelanin neurons was not difficult, and few artefacts were observed. Neuromelanin neurons, were individualizable in the SN (Fig1). Some Parkinsonian neuromelanin neurons contained dense spheric structures repelling the neuromelanin granulations, recognized as LB (Fig2 and Fig3). Pale bodies which are described as precursors of LB were identified too. We were able to visualize different densities of neuromelanin grains within the neuromelanin neurons, correlated to the duration of the disease, and quantify this difference in 3D (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this study we proved non-inferiority of multiscale S-PCI for visualizing LB in PD compared with conventional histological technique, and the capacity to study them in 3D for the first time, as well as the amount of neuromelanin grains in the neurons affected by PD. A deeper understanding of LB 3D structure and their localization in pre-motor organs with the S-PCI technology could allow new therapeutic targets. Figure 3. Lewy Bodies in 3D Figure 4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was a success, despite the particular circumstances related to COVID at the time of the experience, and the reduced period of shifts. We were able to visualize for the first time in 3D Lewy bodies and to quantify and correlate the density of neuromelanin grains with the duration of Parkinson's disease for the first time in 3D. This project is the subject of a new beamtime application in order to increase the scope of our results by showing the presence of Lewy bodies in the organs responsible for the pre-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The data from this experiment will be presented in an oral communication at the European Academy of Neurology Congress in 2022 (see below) and will be the subject of a publication which is currently still in writing process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract to be presented at the 2022 European Academy of Neurology Congress in Vienna</head><p>Background :</p><p>Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease. It is histologically characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregates forming the Lewy Bodies (LB), mostly found in the substantia nigra (SN). Conventional imaging techniques such as MRI or TDM lack of spatial resolution. Histology and electronic microscopy do not allow 3D analysis, require staining and are limited in the size of sample (Âµm). Synchrotron Phase contrast X-ray imaging (S-PCI) is an emerging modality that exploits the differing refractive indices of materials to create additional contrast, especially in soft tissues. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of multiscale S-PCI to visualize the morphologic abnormalities present in human SN affected by PD.</p></div>			</div>
