<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Improvements to the purification, crystallisation conditions and freezing protocols meant that the this protein which only diffracted to 3.5 Å with poor spot shape on the previous synchrotron trips gave good diffraction to 2.1 Å on ID14-2 in June. A full data set in space group P43212, cell 59.45, 59.45, 233.0 was collected to this resolution with Rmerge=0.077(0.322). Two copies were found in the unit cell by molecular replacement using a related small G protein. The structure has now been refined to R=18.4 Rfree=21.5. Although a member of the well described small G protein family, this protein is unusual in that it appears to be physiologically constitutively in the GTP state, similar to some dominant mutants of ras. Using the crystal structure we are able to see some clear reasons for this. We will try and make mutants that do turn over GTP and with our collaborators see what the effect on the cells are. Our collaborators are already finding binding partners for this protein and we hope to obtain some complexes for crystallisation. We are about to prepare a manuscript on this structure.</p><p>A fuller report on the biological implications of this structure will be made in February 2002.</p></div>			</div>
