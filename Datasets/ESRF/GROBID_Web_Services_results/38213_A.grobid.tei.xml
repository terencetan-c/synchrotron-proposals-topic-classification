<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Highly asymmetric Laue diffraction (sagittally focusing Laue monochromator) </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was devoted to study properties of a double surface-shaped Laue-diffracting monochromator.</p><p>The possibility of sagittal focusing of SR by an asymmetric Laue crystal with profiled surface was experimentally demonstrated in our last experiments MI -751 and MI -848. This time we used two identical samples of Si single crystals with two parallel holes of the diameter of 8 mm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) in a dispersive arrangement. The axes of the holes formed an angle of 7.95° with (111) diffracting planes. The minimum thickness of this Laue crystal was 0.5 mm.The 15.35 keV SR was diffracted in the space between the holes. The impinging and diffracted beam formed the angle of 0.55° with the local surface. The diffracted beam entered the second crystal under the same angle and was diffracted as well. The dispersive setting was used in the goal of canceling both the vertical and horizontal spread of the focus observed in the previous experiment. We observed a diffraction with a focusing effect (convergent beam) after the first crystal and after the second crystal separately. In our last experiment (MI -848) we observed several interesting scattering effects (see MI -848 report). During this experiment we could repeat these parasitic scatterings and explain them. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> we can see two such "scattering centers" which are created due to total reflection of the incident beam. The interference fringes which we observed in the last experiment were created by the surface inhomogenities due to the drilling process. The low incident angle (0.55°) is very sensitive to sufrece inhomogenities. After we polished the surface again, the interference fringes disapeared. We wasn´t able to observe the diffraction after two crystal, because from the total impinging radiation after two 0.5 mm thick Si crystals and 150 cm of air just 9% remained. Considering the background radiation, the used CCD camera wasn´t sensitive enough the register the diffraction, which was in the last experiment observed. Futhermore we observed a double difraction, which was due to higher harmonics, figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Even we de-tuned the monochromator by 20%, we observed the higher harmonics. This gives the possibility to study a new kind of harmonics rejection based on diffractive -refractive optics. Furthemore we will simulate with help of ray-tracing programs the calculated focus and compare it with the CCD images we obtained.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Peter Oberta* Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Martin Kittler* Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Petr Mikulík* Institute of Condensed Matter Physics, Brno, Czech Republic</figDesc></figure>
