<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The project was aimed at: 1) revealing the structure modifications of FF nanotubes at various temperatures and pressures, and 2) understanding the dynamics of water-FF interaction and related quantities. The first aim required to use ID27 beamline, whereas the second -ID28. Since only ID27 beamline has been assigned, we restricted ourselves with the first aim.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the project we have performed single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments of three types: 1) determination of FF nanotubes' structure at high pressure, 2) determination of FF nanotubes' structure at low temperatures, and 3) determination of the structure of crystals of derivatives of FF dipeptides at ambient pressure and temperature. We have studied single crystalline microtubes representing bundles of arranged FF nanotubes and needle-like solvate crystals of cycled FF monomers formed in the solution. Both microtubes and crystals have typical lengths up to 5 mm and diameters 50-100 μm, which were suitable for the beamline station. It was found that the intensity of diffraction peaks is quite low. Therefore, careful integration of the obtained diffraction patterns was required, and this took more time than we expected. For the moment we have processed only data for temperature measurements and for solvate crystals and have solved their crystal structures.</p><p>Pressure measurements were performed in helium filled DAC in pressure range 0.11-14.5 GPa. In total 18 measurements have been performed. At each pressure point a survey diffraction pattern has been measured and then a set of detailed patterns with a 0.5 degree step were collected. The integrating of the obtained diffraction patterns is in progress and the results will be reported in the forthcoming paper.</p><p>Temperature measurements were performed in the temperature range 95-290 on cooling and heating. In total 14 measurements have been performed. To control the temperature a CryoStream system was used. At each temperature point a survey diffraction pattern has been measured and then a set of detailed patterns with a 0.5 degree step were collected.</p><p>The obtained results reliably showed that at ambient conditions FF nanotubes belong to P6 5 space group, whereas P6 1 is usually reported in the literature. It is known, that 230 crystallographic space groups were obtained for the right-handed coordinate system, whereas for a number of chemical compounds a left-handed system is necessary. Therefore this difference can be attributed to the chirality of the used dipeptide. In our study we used D-Phe-D-Phe form, whereas L-Phe-L-Phe is usually reported. The results will be reported in the paper (in preparation).</p><p>The solved crystal structure at ambient conditions is presented at Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. Parameters of this structure coincide with those reported in the literature. Analysis of low-temperature crystal structures demonstrated non-monotonic behavior of cell volume and cell parameters of the nanotubes with local minima at about 200 K. At the same temperature an anomaly in the temperature dependence of dielectric permittivity has been observed by us. Thus the results obtained in this project allowed us to shed light on the origin of this anomaly.</p><p>We also have solved the structure of solvate crystals of cycled FF monomers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). Similar cycled monomers occur at elevated temperatures (above 140°C). The solvate form of monomers' FF crystal has not been studied yet. The results are being prepared for the publication. To conclude, we suppose that the project SC-4587 has been succsesfully realized. The results revealed important details of the crystal structure of FF nanotubes and allowed to shed light on data, obtained earlier by other methods. For sure, further analysis will bring new valuable information important for the understanding the role of water in the process of self-assembly of peptide nanotubes, phase transitions under varying external conditions, and FF-water interactions. The obtained results are going to be published in high-impact scientific journals and presented at international conferences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
