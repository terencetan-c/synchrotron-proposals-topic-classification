<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>X-ray diffraction tensor tomography (XRDTT) experiments were performed according to the plan in the beamtime proposal. Two samples consisting of porcine bone and cartilage of approximate dimensions 2 x 2 x 2 mm 3 were measured with XRDTT. Additionally a third bone and cartilage sample and a sample of Pierre shale 1 were measured with X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT), using similar setup as for XRDTT using a single tomography axis. Complementary propagation phase-contrast CT (PPC-CT) and attenuation contrast CT was performed after the XRDTT/XRD-CT experiments.</p><p>For XRDTT a multi-axis rotation stage was used to tilt the sample around a horizontal axis while rotation of the sample around a conventional tomography axis. A total of 65 × 67 points in (x,y) were collected per projection, with a step size of 50 µm in x and y. For each sample, 259 projections were obtained from combination of projection angles β ϵ <ref type="table">[0</ref>, <ref type="table">40º]</ref> and <ref type="table">α ϵ [0</ref>, <ref type="table">360º]</ref>. For β = 0, equivalent to ordinary perpendicularaxis tomography, 61 projections with α ϵ [0, 180º] were obtained. For β ϵ [5, 40º] a reduced number of projections were measured compared to β = 0. A total number of 65 × 67 × 259 = 1,127,945 diffraction patterns were collected. An exposure time of 50 ms for each diffraction pattern was used, giving a total exposure time of 15.2 hours. With additional overhead time for motor movements, the total measurement time was approximately 26 hours.</p><p>For the shale sample XRD-CT measurements were done by using a single tomography axis, i.e. α = 0, cf. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The beam was line scanned in x while the sample was rotated about y between each line scan. The scanning direction was reversed between each line scan, to reduce motor movement time. 71 steps in x and a total number of 61 angular steps of β ϵ [0, 180º] were used (Δβ = 3.0º). The scan procedure was repeated for 29 steps in y to measure the full 3D volume, effectively giving 74 × 61 × 29 = 155,559 recorded diffraction patterns for the full sample. An exposure time of 30 ms was used. The total measurement time was approximately 2 hours, including over-head time for motor movements.</p><p>Hydroxyapatite (HA) crystallites in the bone regions of the samples provided oriented diffraction signal which could be used for tensor tomography reconstruction of the local orientation of the HA crystallite c axis orientation within the bone/cartilage samples, illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. For the shale sample the XRD-CT provided spatatially resolved chemical information about the sample and in addition the clay mineral orientation could be studied, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Hydroxyapatite crystallite orientation in a bone and cartilage sample from a pig, obtained by XRDTT. a) Cross-section of the sample. b-c) Magnified sections corresponding to the dashed boxes in a).
