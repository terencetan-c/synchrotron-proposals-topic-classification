<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>Prohibitins are composed of two subunits prohibitin-1 (PHB1) and prohibitin-2 (PHB2), each subunit possesses an N-terminal helices (NT-PHB1 and NI-PHB2). The N-terminal helices have been hypothesized to have the function of anchoring the complex to the membrane, but experimental evidence is missing. With XRR we aim to clarify how the interaction between the N-terminal helices of prohibitin and the membrane occurs, as well as the role of lipid membrane composition is still ongoing. Data analysis is not completed, however, a not strong interaction could be observed between the peptide and the membrane. Fitting of the data will allow a better understanding of this phenomenon.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scientific background:</head><p>Prohibitins are a highly conserved protein heterodimer complex composed of two subunits prohibitin-1 (PHB1) and prohibitin-2 (PHB2), which form a large multimeric ring (12-20 dimers) in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IM). Each subunit possesses an N-terminal helices (NT-PHB1 and NI-PHB2). The formation of the Prohibitin ring is influenced by cardiolipin (CL). In the IM, Prohibitins interact with m-AAA protease [1, 2], and play a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>. Prohibitins have N-terminal transmembrane helices that display a degree of amphiphilicity and are thought to anchor the proteins to the membranes <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>. Alteration or deletion of PHB leads to viral infection, cardiac and neurovascular diseases, and cellular ageing. Several hypotheses have been postulated with regards to the Prohibitin complex structure but their exact molecular arrangement at the inner mitochondrial membrane is still unresolved. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) will help us investigate the interaction between the N-terminal helices of prohibitin (PHB) and the membrane by locating and quantifying peptides in the bilayer. The aim of the experiment was to investigate the concentration threshold of the peptide-membrane interactions. The role of the lipid membrane composition in the peptide-membrane interaction was also studied in this experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Material and methods:</head><p>The experiment was performed at a solid-liquid interface employing a cell without a fluid flow system. To vary the scattering vector Qz, the grazing angle was varied stepwise from 0 to 1.8 degrees to cover a Qz range from 0 to 0.8 Å employing a monochromatic beam with energy 22 keV corresponding to the wavelength 5.627 x 10 -1 Å. The incident beam size (HxV) was 22x13 μm 2 .</p><p>Bilayers with peptides were characterized in a Q-range of 1x10 -3 and 1 Å -1 with 6 scans, while the bilayer without peptides was characterized covering a Q range between 1x10 -3 and 1 Å -1 , performing 3 scans with DOPC and 6 scans with DOPC: DOPE: CL 18:1 (40:40:20% wt %) and DOPC: CL 18:1 (80: 20 wt %).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results:</head><p>Reflectometry experiments at the solid-liquid interface were performed.</p><p>The effect of different peptide concentrations on DOPC, DOPC:DOPE: CL 18:1 bilayer was tested after having well characterized the bilayer alone. Bilayers were deposited with vesicle fusion. Data analyses were performed with DOPC and DOPC: DOPE: CL 18:1 with motofit.</p><p>Several scans of the same sample were performed to assess the homogeneity of the samples.</p><p>The different scans performed on the two bilayers show a higher similarity for the DOPC bilayer while presenting a higher variability for DOPC: DOPE: CL 18:1. They were subsequently averaged discarding obvious outliers.</p><p>The presence of the bilayer for both systems was confirmed by the preliminary fitting of the data. NT-PHB1, NT-PHB2, and NT-PHB1+2 were injected in the bilayers at different concentrations. The X-ray reflectivity profile with and without peptides do not present significant differences, indicating a not strong interaction interaction between them. However, data analysis is still ongoing. This experiment will be part of a manuscript that is under preparation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Dr Alice Piccinini (ILL Grenoble, France) Dr PREVOST Sylvain (ILL Grenoble, France) FRAGNETO GIOVANNA (ILL Grenoble, France) Prof. FORSYTH Trevor (Linx, Lund, Sweden) Dr WINTER Anja (Keele University, United Kingdom)</figDesc></figure>
