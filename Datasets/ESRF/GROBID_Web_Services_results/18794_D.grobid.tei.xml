<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We used a new crystal form of mouse acetylcholinesterase (AchE) that permits more accurate studies of the peripheral anionic site of this enzyme. This new crystal form diffracts up to 2.2 Å resolution and contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit, with the catalytic gorge entrance being freely solvent accessible in each subunit. This differs from the previous 3 Å resolution structure (1) for which only one molecule out of two possessed a solvent-accessible gorge entrance. In addition, the previous crystal form grew with a high salt concentration compared to a low salt concentration required for the new crystal form, a critical parameter to study ligands directed to the peripheral anionic site. We used a new compound that displays high affinity for this site and performed co-crystallization experiments with AChE using large excess of this compound. Indeed, previous data from similar crystals soaked with similar compounds showed only partial occupancies. Data obtained from these crystals are of excellent quality. For these two structures, rigid-body refinement was then performed on each subunit with CNS using data between 30 Å and 3 Å and gave an R-factor and R-free value of 23.7. For 2% of the reflections against which the two models were not refined, R-free was 23.1%. Refinement of this two structure is underway at 2.4 Å resolution. The final model will be used for a comparative study with other peripheral ligands for which data have been recently collected at ESRF.</p></div>

Aiguier 13402 Marseille Cedex 20 2 Laboratory for Phytopathology and Plant Protection, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium We have obtained crystals of a new lectin from tulip bulbs, TxLCI, that possesses uncommon carbohydrate binding sites. The lectin is composed of two distinct domains, each domain possesses a different sugar specificity, one domain recognizes mannose while the other one binds N-acetyl-galactosamine (1). One domain possesses high homology with a lectin from snowdrop bulbs while the other shares only few homologies. A complete native data set has been already collected on beamine ID14-EH2 at 2.1 Å resolution. Attemps to solve the structure by molecular replacement using different homologuous structures failed. Because this protein cannot be over-expressed in bacteria, we plan to use the new method consisting of a rapid soak of crystals in the cryo solution supplemented with highly concentrated halide salts to solve the phase problem.

Ribavirin (1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent whose exact mode of action remains controversial. Many viruses are inhibited by ribavirin. It is currently used for treatment of infections such as HCV as well as of co-infections due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HCV. The inhibition mechanism is still elusive and may result from both direct and indirect effects. Since ribavirin is a guanosine analogue, NS5 is a candidate to be a target of ribavirin. It was also shown that ribavirin-triphosphate is a direct inhibitor of the viral MTase of vaccinia virus. GpppA is a cap analogue which is commercially available. It has already been used for the characterization of several capping enzymes. The three dimensional structure of the complex between CEF and GpppA would be of great help in localizing the active site and understanding the mecanism of the mRNA transcript recognition. CEF crystals were soaked in either GpppA or Ribavirin triphosphate, flash frozen and collected during this experiment.

AGX1 and AGX2 are the human enzymes responsible for UDPGlcNAc biosynthesis from UTP and GlcNAc-1P in presence of Mg2+. These enzymes are isoforms of the same gene and differ by the insertion in AGX2 of an additional 17-residue segment near the C-terminus. Substrate specificity studies showed that these two enzymes have both UDPGlcNAc and UDPGalNAc synthesis activity at a ratio of 1:3 for AGX1 and 8:1 for AGX2, suggesting that the 17-residue insert is responsible for a change in the enzyme activity 1 .</p><p>To better understand the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes as well as the 17 residue-induced substrate specificity change, we have solved the structures of AGX1 and AGX2 complexed with UDPGlcNAc. The structure of AGX1-UDPGlcNAc was solved by Se-Met MAD at beamline BM14 and refined it at 1.9 Å resolution, whilst that of AGX2-UDPGlcNAc was obtained by molecular replacement using the AGX1 model and data collected on beamline ID14-3. (in first part of the year 2000).</p><p>These structures reveal an AGX fold composed of 3 domains: a large central domain reminiscent of the Rossmann fold, as found in other nucleotidyltransferases, flanked by two smaller extra domains, the N-terminal domain which defines a new fold and the C-terminal domain which is mostly involved in dimerisation of AGX1. In order to get further insight into the catalytic mechanism and most precisely to determine the role of the divalent cation indispensable for the reaction, we crystallised AGX1 in presence of MgCl2 and collected diffraction data. Unfortunately, no extra electron density was observed in the active site suggesting that the magnesium cation was not present.

Nov 2000 Date of report: Feb 01 Shifts: 6 shifts Local contact(s): Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): *Mirjam Czjzek, CNRS-AFMB Marseille Bernard Henrissat, CNRS-AFMB Marseille Julie Allouch, CNRS-AFMB Marseille Report: High molecular weight cytochrome HMC from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough</p><p>Multiheme cytochromes c are type III cytochromes, present in the periplasm of all sulfate and sulfur reducing anaerobic bacteria. The structures of tetra-heme, octa-heme and nine-heme containing cytochromes c are known, but no representant of the 16 heme containing, high molecular weight cytochrome is known to date. It seems however evident, that this high molecular weight cytochrome is composed of cytochrome c 3 -like domains. Molecular replacement is therefore the adequate technic to solve the structure. The precise physiolgocal role of these different multiheme cytochromes have not yet been completely elucidated, the cytochrome HMC is supposed to interact with a transmembrane electron transporter.Recently, we obtained one single crystal of HMC and a native data collection in the laboratory was possible at 3.2 Å resolution. Diffraction spots were visible up to 2.8 Å. The molecular replacement in the resolution range 12Å-4.5Å gave a clear solution for "half" of the protein (correlation coefficient 25.</p><p>1, R-factor 49.1), and density is clearly visible for the other half. A complete data set was collected on ID14 EH2 at 2.4 Å resolution. The data collection statistics are given below. The construction of the 16 heme containing molecule is under way. Table 1.

These modules, such as the catalytic domains can be grouped in families, having the same structural fold. Within a family the specificity may vary but the members are marked by highly conserved residues, responsible for the binding sites. The CBM from xylanase U, 133 amino acids long, has been classified in family 6 of the CBM's and no structure is known to date. In order to understand the origin of different specifcities the structural model is a precious information that helps interpretate bichemical and enzymatic results. CBM6 from Xylanase U naturally does not contain methionine residues. Four mutants, each introducing a methionine residue, Y40M, R72M, W92M and Y112M, were therefore produced in conditions leading to selenomethionized proteins. Two of the mutants crystallized under the same conditions as the native protein. The crystals have the form of very thin needles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) and diffraction was not detectable on a rotating anode. In order to prepare a MAD experiment on ID14 EH4, two "native" data sets were collected on ID14 EH2 prior to the available beamtime on ID14 EH4.
