<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Names and affiliations of applicants (*indicates experimentalists):</head><p>Report:</p><p>The object of the experiment was to detect parametric down conversion of x-rays by a phase matching scheme which was originally used by Eisenberger and McCall. Being a nonlinear-optical effect, it is very weak and hard to detect. Due t.o a small nonlinearity in the electrical susceptibility of free electrons, there is small cross section f'or the process of an x-ray photon spontaneously decaying into two whose energies add up to that of the incident photon. The converted photons become directed to two detectors if a phase matching condition is fulfilled by detuning a crystalline sample by about 0.01 degrees (depending on the exact experimental geometry) from a Braggh reflex. The converted photons then exit the sample at angles of ca. 1 degree on opposite sides of the (rather weak) reflected beam of unconverted photons. Thc experimenta.1 setup is shown in fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In order to separate the converted photons from the back-gro~tn(l~ a t,ime correlation technique and energy discrimation were used. Since energy discrimination ~'a11 Ilever be 100 percent perfect, there is always a background of events produced by photons which are scattered elastically at the sample. These events produce a statistical coincidence rate which can 1~ determined from the rate of statistical time correlations at time differences other than zero. 'l-11(1 conversion process shows up in the time correlation spectra as a. peak at zero time dela,y above a Background of statistical correlations. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows such a time correlation spectrum, collected within :j hours at an incident flux of 1.5. 1011 photons of 14.4keV per second. The detuning angle was 0.0217" for which the maximum conversion rate was expected. At a detuning a.ngle of -0.0217" for which no conversion was expected, the corresponding time correlation spectrum, also takin within 3 hours, shows no coincidence peak (fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
