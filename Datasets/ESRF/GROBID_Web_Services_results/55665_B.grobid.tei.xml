<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>executed. In the end the experiments could start on the second day of our 2-day beamtime in the evening at 18.00 hour. So we could only measure in the last night. Therefore we decided to do only fast experiments. Furthermore because of the orientation WAXD was not combined with SAXS, but instead WAXD patterns were recorded from compression tests performed at elevated temperatures, using a custom made oven.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Did you encounter experimental problems?</head><p>YES. In the night from 4 to 5 November a water cut in the ESRF took place. Therefore the turbo pump could not be cooled any more, and as a result it stopped working. The vacuum on the monochromator vented away, resulting into problems. An example of the problems was that the beam started to drift. This also caused huge deviations in the intensity measured at the beamstop, also during the experiments we were able to do.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Was the local support adequate?</head><p>YES. The problem with the monochromator was complicated, but in the end G. Portale and D.</p><p>Detollenaere managed to solve the problems. The setup was mounted by F. Ledrappier and the result is shown in the picture below on the left. The custom made oven is shown on the right. For more information please contact the secretariat, tel.: +31-70-3494011, e-mail: dubble@nwo.nl December 2012</p><p>5. Are the obtained results at this stage in line with the expected results as mentioned on the project proposal? YES. We are able to see phase transitions from iPP gamma phase to alpha phase at elevated temperatures (110 degrees Celsius) as a result of the applied deformation. Also in case of beta crystals we see a transformation towards alpha crystals. The alpha crystals remain in the alpha phase however, also in case of alpha crystals a decrease in crystallinity is observed. This is shown in the figures below, where the results for all three crystallographic structures, measured at 110 degrees and a strain rate of 0.01 reciprocal seconds are shown. Also the true stress resulting from the applied true strain, as a function of time is shown here. Similar results are obtained for measurements performed at 50 degrees Celsius and room temperature. In that case the crystallinity dropped upon the application of strain 0 40 80 120 160 200 240 0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 crystallinity [-] time beta 10 -2 s -1 @ 110°C 0 4 8 12 16 stress [MPa] crystallinity β α compression </p></div>
