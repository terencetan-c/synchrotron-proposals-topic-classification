<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>ii) X-ray induced degradation: BAM-based phosphors suffer from damage during VUV irradiation and this is the main drawback concerning their technological use as efficient blue phosphors. X-rays irradiation induces a very fast degradation of BAM samples which can ave the same origin as VUV damage. We mounted a UV-vis portable spectrometer near the sample stage and by measuring fast XANES (2 s exploiting continuous scans) we were able to follow x-ray induced damage on the local structure of Mn and Eu impurities and on the UV-vis luminescence emitted by the samples under x-rays excitation. We clearly see that Mn electronic structure stays unchanged, while Eu undergoes a very fast oxidation to Eu 3+ . On the other hand, luminescence from Eu and Mn are both degraded. iii) Mn local structure during Eu excitation: We finally mounted two 405 nm lasers to excite Eu impurities and measured Mn K-edge XANES while alternating laser on/laser off cycles. Mn is efficiently excited through Eu excitation and it has a higher lifetime compared to Eu. We thus decided to monitor Mn Kedge to look for structural changes connected to the excited state. We optimized the set-up to focus as much as possible the excitation source and alternate laser on/laser off measurements to minimize the effects of drifts, but we were not able to detect any spectral difference. Most probably a higher excitation power is needed to consistently excite Mn impurities. Moreover, the sample investigated had a very high amount of Mn (as indicated by laboratory characterization after the beamtime) making the observation of differences harder.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Left: Mn K-edge XANES with laser on (red) and laser off (black) and the relative difference. Right: a detail of the strong pre-edge feature. We were not able to detect any variation of Mn electronic strucutre upon excitation. The fast deexcitation process and the medium power of the 405 nm lasers made the observation of differences difficult.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure1:</head><figDesc>Figure1: Left: Mn K-edge XANES of samples containing Mn.
