<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of stress on the lamellar thickness of HDPE and PP. Under the assumption of a two-phase model, both SAXS and WAXD results are required to determine the lamellar thickness. The results from the SAXS-study have been used to determine the long spacing of the samples. The WAXD-results give the amount of crystallinity in the sample and are meant to determine lamellar thickness from the long spacing data. The x-ray experiments have been performed under the following conditions:</p><p>• 1D-WAXD detector • 2D-SAXS detector at 5,5 meters</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">• E = 12 keV, λ = 1.0333 Å</formula><p>Tensile bars of 1mm thickness were cut from a 1 mm compression molded thick sheet (PE-Q). In addition, a number of these HDPE samples were annealed (PE-A) in a hot air oven for 24 hours at 100ºC. A special temperature chamber was built to investigate these samples under static loading at elevated temperatures, see figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. It was chosen to investigate the lamellar thickness of the PE-Q samples in-situ at 100ºC and the PE-A samples at 110ºC for about 3 hours (=10800 s). The loads applied were 0MPa, as a reference, and 2MPa or 3MPa. Due to a lack of time, there was no chance to investigate the PP samples properly.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref> shows the long spacing in the course of time for the PE-Q samples with a load of 0MPa, 2MPa and 3 MPa derived from the SAXS-data. It can be seen that the long spacing of the loaded samples grows faster than the unloaded sample. However interpretation is complicated by a variation in the initial long spacing. In addition, the long spacing of the PE-A samples varied, but a selection of samples with identical initial long spacing shows clearly that the long spacing of the loaded sample increases faster than the unloaded samples, see figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>. Also the initial degrees of crystallinity of the different samples show a large variation (0.38-0.48). However, the trends observed in the long spacing are promising, and a better sample preparation might show the same trend for lamellar thickness.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>An in-situ study on the influence of stress on the lamellar thickness</figDesc></figure>
