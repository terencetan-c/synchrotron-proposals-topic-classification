<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V-DOPED SAMPLES</head><p>The samples have been shown to contain V in the olivine lattice, and not as secondary phases. The substitution mechanism Li 1-X Fe 1-X V X PO 4 has thus been confirmed by both XRD data and theoretical XANES calculations which agree well with experimental XANES data at the V Kedge. V K-edge EXAFS data are currently under examination. The fact that V is in the 3+ state in both the oxidised and reduced electrodes means that it does not participate in the redox reaction (Li exchange upon Fe reduction/oxidation) in the voltage range used for the electrode cycling.</p><p>Comparison of the Fe redox ratio with the electrochemical data determined for the cathodes allowed to ascertain that the Fe utilization increases with the V content despite V is not electroactive. The higher Fe utilization is tentatively explained by the presence of Li vacancies in the M1 site produced by the purposed substitution mechanism. Moreover, also local lattice distortion triggered by the V entry in the M2 site could help Li exchange. The results of this study have been published in Moretti et al., (2013)  Zn-DOPED SAMPLES Also these samples have been shown to contain Zn in the olivine lattice, and not as secondary phases. The substitution mechanism Li 1 Fe 1-X Zn X PO 4 has thus been confirmed. These data are still under study. In particular, EXAFS data will be compared with XRD data to determine the geometrical variations induced by the Zn entry in the M2 site.</p><p>Further theoretical XANES calculations will be performed by the MXAN code in order to reproduce the spectral features found in the experimental data at the Zn K-edge, while theoretical EXAFS calculations is being performed by GNXAS package. A further paper will be submitted on the Zn-bearing LiFePO 4 samples.</p><p>Driven by the consumer market, more efficient use of renewable energy sources and by possible applications in electric vehicles, the demand for advanced energy storage batteries has increased significantly during the past decade. Because of their characteristics, lithium ion batteries are one of the most important candidates for all the above applications. At present the main challenges for development of lithium ion batteries for mass market are cost, safety, energy and power densities, charge/discharge rate and service life. <ref type="bibr">1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref> In this context, the olivine LiFePO 4 is considered a possible alternative to commonly used metal oxides (LiMO 2 ) and spinels (LiM 2 O 4 ) positive electrodes in Li-ion batteries, because of its reasonably high theoretical energy storage capacity (170 mAhg -1 ) combined with electrochemical and thermal stability, low cost and environmental benignity. <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> The main limitations of LiFePO 4 are its low intrinsic electronic conductivity (10 -9 Scm -1 ), which prevents full use of its theoretical capacity and the low Li-ion diffusion coefficient (ranging between 10 -11 and 10 -13 cm 2 s -1 ). 6,7 Several approaches have been proposed and explored to overcome these drawbacks, including particles coating with carbon 8,9 or other conductive species, <ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">11</ref> and decreasing particles size to nano-scale. <ref type="bibr">12,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> In recent years, lattice engineering has also been investigated as a possible way to obtain electronically conductive phospho-olivine. <ref type="bibr">14,</ref><ref type="bibr">15</ref> Although many publications report the feasibility of aliovalent doping (e.g. Mo 6+ , Ti 4+ , Al 3+ , Zr 4+ ) and its beneficial role on the electrochemical properties of LiFePO 4 , <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> this issue is still under debate due to conflicting results. <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr">[23]</ref> Some authors observed that the improved electronic conductivity after metal doping may arise from carbon contamination 24 or phosphides formation. <ref type="bibr">25</ref> Moreover, using atomistic simulation techniques, Islam et al. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> found that only divalent metal dopants can be introduced in the LiFePO 4 lattice while aliovalent doping is not tolerated.</p><p>Among the different transition metals employed as dopants, vanadium is one of the most intriguing elements because of its various oxidation states and different coordination chemistry. Furthermore, vanadium can form electrochemically active compounds such as Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 , 27-29 α,β-LiVOPO 4 30,31 and V x O y 32-34 that can find application as cathode materials in lithium ion batteries. Recent studies on V-doped LiFePO 4 have shown that vanadium substitution into olivine lattice enhances the electrochemical performances of this cathode material. <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr">[46]</ref> However, there are still open issues about coordination geometry and oxidation state of the dopant that prevent a precise * Electrochemical Society Active Member. z E-mail: arianna.moretti@unicam.it correlation between structure and the improved electrochemical performances.</p><p>Yang 36 and Sun 38 observed V 3+ substitution on Fe site and consequent increase of the unit cell parameters. On the contrary, Ma 40 showed an inverse dependence between unit cell volume and the amount of V 4+ replacing the iron up to 7 at% of substitution. After that limit, secondary phases as VO 2 and Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 are formed. Zhang 41 limited the range of solid solution between V and Fe up to 3 at.% substitution before the formation of Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 and LiVOPO 4 . Zhao 47 investigated, by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, the solubility of V at both Fe and P sites showing the formation of Li 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 and the absence of any structural changes of the LiFePO 4 phase. As also pointed out in the recent work of Hong 46 these discrepancies could probably arise from the different synthesis methods used.</p><p>In this context, and with the aim of clarifying whether aliovalent doping of LiFePO 4 is possible or not, we synthesized a series of V-doped LiFePO 4 samples and systematically studied the effect of V-doping on the crystal lattice parameters using a variety of techniques. Among many possible substitution mechanisms (such as those reported e.g. in Meethong et al. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> ), we decided to study the effect of V 3+ substitution for Fe 2+ trying to balance this aliovalent substitution by creating a lithium vacancy in the M1 site according to the formula Li 1-x Fe 1-x V x PO 4 . The study of different substitution mechanisms other than those reported in the literature can be useful in view of the fact that different V oxidation states and different defect creation mechanisms can lead to different electrochemical properties.</p><p>The samples have been characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) techniques to provide detailed information on structural variation as a function of the V content, oxidation state of the dopant and its location in the lattice. The electrochemical performances of doped samples have been evaluated in comparison with those of pristine LiFePO 4 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In recent times, considerable efforts have been devoted to study physical and chemical properties of Li-phosphate olivines, mainly for their possible use as a storage cathode for rechargeable lithium batteries. Compounds under consideration include LiMPO 4 olivines where M is a transition metal (see for example [1]). Key factors for using these materials in batteries are their electrical and ion (Li þ ) conductivities.</p><p>In particular, the olivine-type LiFePO 4 (triphylite) has attracted much attention as a suitable cathode material for high-power Libased batteries [2]. LiFePO 4 has been extensively studied because of its attractive properties such as inexpensiveness, non-toxicity, high theoretical capacity (w170 mAh g À1 ), excellent cycling and thermal stability [3e5].</p><p>The key drawbacks of LiFePO 4 are its low electronic conductivity and reversible capacity. Various synthesis and processing approaches have been employed to improve the conductivity and cyclability of the LiFePO 4 [6e8]. Many studies have been devoted to optimize the material for better electrochemical performance and try to understand the lithium intercalation/deintercalation mechanism [9e11].</p><p>It has been shown [1,2] that significant increases of the electrical conductivity can be induced by controlled nonstoichiometry and cation doping, improving the performances of current electrodes.</p><p>Structural changes in triphylite due to solid solutions of a metal M with iron (LiFe 1Àx M x PO 4 ) may have significant effects on its solid electrolyte properties, including rates of Li diffusion and activation energies. Thus, detailed knowledge of structure in solid solutions is important in the development and design of Li-based olivine storage cathodes. Several structural studies have been performed on LiFe 1Àx M x PO 4 solid solutions [12e18], few discussing structural variations that occur as a function of M content x. In particular, no detailed structural works on LiFe 1Àx Ni x PO 4 solid solutions have been attempted so far, although this material can be possibly useful in a wide range of concentrations in view of the similarity of the cation radii.</p><p>In this work, we present new results of a structural study of LiFe 1Àx Ni x PO 4 solid solutions for different Ni concentration x.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Journal of the electrochemical society (160 (6), A940-A949.Ni-DOPED SAMPLES Also these samples have been shown to contain Ni in the olivine lattice, and not as secondary phases. The substitution mechanism Li 1 Fe 1-X Ni X PO 4 has thus been confirmed by both XRD data and XANES data on the Ni oxidation state. These data are preliminary, and further data have been later collected at ELETTRA. The local structure measured by XAS shows that average Fe-O and Ni-O distances do not change appreciably with Ni doping indicating that the reduction of cell size is mainly associated with the presence of shorter Ni-O distances at M2 sites. The study of Fe and Ni K-edge data allowed to publish a paper by Tabassam et al. (2012), Journal of Power Sources, 213, 287-295</figDesc></figure>
