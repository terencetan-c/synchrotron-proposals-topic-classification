<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>First, we would like to apologize for the delay regarding the submission of this experimental report.</p><p>The aim of the CH-5346 experiments was to unravel the degradation mechanisms of Fe-based electrocatalysts in situ (i.e. under potential control) using WAXS and SAXS. A pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of the WAXS data was planned as we knew that this class of materials is structurally amorphous/disordered. Three different Fe-N-C electrocatalysts were synthesized specifically for the experiment using ZIF-8, Fe acetate, and phenanthroline. The Fe, N and C precursors were mixed via dry planetary ball milling and pyrolysed at 1050 °C under Ar. We labelled the materials as Fex, where x is the weight fraction of Fe before the pyrolysis step (0, 0.5 or 5.0 weight. %). The catalysts were extensively characterized by X-ray absorption (XAS), transmission electron microscopy, Raman and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller techniques. We observed that the Fe5.0 catalyst comprises Fe carbide nanoparticles surrounded by a shell of N-doped graphitic carbon, while the Fe0.5 catalyst comprises Fe cations atomically dispersed in the N-doped carbon matrix. Moreover, the carbon matrix was found more graphitic for Fe5.0, and more amorphous for Fe0.5 (the most promising material for oxygen reduction reaction, the cathodic reaction in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> displays the PDF analyses of the WAXS patterns for Fe0.0, Fe0.5 and Fe5.0. As brutto G(r) graphs were poorly informative, we subtracted the signal of the carbon matrix (Fe0.0) and normalized the intensity of the G(r) traces by the intensity of the C-C peak at ca. 1.41 angströms. Intense bands at 2. <ref type="bibr">60, 3.77, 4.23, 4.57 and 5.19</ref> angströms in the 'Normalized Fe5.0-Fe0.0' difference signal confirmed that Fe5.0 is essentially composed of Fe3C nanoparticles, not Fe0.5 (at least within the detection limit of the technique). The weak intensity of the Fe5.0-Fe0.0 PDF analyses for the Fe0.5 catalyst cast a doubt on the use of WAXS data. This fear has been confirmed as the intensity was noisier and lower after the Fe0.5 catalyst was coated with a thin layer of Nafion and immersed in liquid electrolyte for electrochemical measurements. Despite all our efforts, we were unable to extract any relevant information from the in situ-measurements on Fe0.5.</p><p>Nevertheless, a manuscript combining the PDF analyses of WAXS spectra with other data has been written, and submitted to Applied Catalysis B: Environmental in January 2022. It is currently under revision, and ESRF will be acknowledged for excellent support and beamtime allocation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
