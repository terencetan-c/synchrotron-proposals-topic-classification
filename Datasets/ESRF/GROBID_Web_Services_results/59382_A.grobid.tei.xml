<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Lattice Dynamics of the Superconducting monophosphate tungsten bronze P4W14O50 with two charge density waves </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The family of monophosphate tungsten bronzes with pentagonal tunnels (PO 2 ) 4 (WO 3 ) 2m is a large family of low dimensional metallic oxides presenting an interesting lattice dynamics, with up to three Charge-Density Wave (CDW) transitions occurring at temperatures ranging from 730K to 30K. The transitions are accompanied by a periodic distortion of the atomic structure that induces the appearance of satellite reflexions on the diffraction pattern. During this experiment, we studied the member m=8, with formula P 4 W 16 O 56 , presenting two commensurate CDW instabilities appearing at approximatively 260K (T CDW1 ) and 160K (T CDW2 ) with different nesting vectors coupling different parts of the Fermi surface. The crystal had been characterized by elastic X ray diffraction and diffuse scattering showing diffuse line at above T CDW1 which then condenses in satellite reflexions below the first transition at T CDW1.</p><p>The aim of the experiment was to evidence the mechanisms of the CDW formation along the successive transitions using inelastic x-ray scattering on a single crystal of P 4 W 16 O 56 as a function of the temperature and by studying acoustic phonons and their eventual softening. We first checked the value of the two transition temperature T CDW1 and T CDW2 by monitoring the intensity near a CDW1 satellite position. As shown in figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> we observed two transitions at 250 and 140 K in agreement with previous experiment. Then, we have measured by IXS constant q energy scans along several directions at different temperatures. A first set of measurements was carried out with the Si (9 9 9) with resolution of 3 meV for longitudinal and transverse direction, in order to explore rapidly different Brillouin zone and locate the best q and T measuring conditions. We then switched to the Si(12 12 12) mono to get an energy resolution of the order 1.4 meV.</p><p>Measurements were carried out mainly in almost transverse geometry around the strong (4 0 0) Bragg peak.</p><p>In particular we explored the dynamical response along the direction of strong diffuse scattering (-ξ 0 -10ξ) above T CDW1 at different temperature. Indeed this strong diffuse scattering intensity condenses in different CDW satellite reflections positional along the diffuse line, see figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. This experiment leads to two main results: i) For scans along the direction (-ξ 0 -10ξ) we observe a clear phonon softening, with a minimum energy equal to roughly 3.8 meV when q is close to the strong elastic line at (3.5,0,5) as shown in the diffuse scattering in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The FWHM graph in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref> shows a tendency of the phonon to become larger near the softening; ii)</p><p>We did not observed, in the explored range (Tc=260K Tmax=400K), any significant temperature evolution of the soft phonon mode energy. We rather have observed a rapid decrease of the central elastic line intensity as the temperature is increased as shown in the Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref> and <ref type="figure">1c</ref>. This seems to be the signature of an order/disorder transition, as proposed in a polaronic model by Aubry et al. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> in the context of strong coupling theory, rather than a 'classical' displacive soft phonon mode softening as in a Peierls transition, where the phonon goes to zero energy at Tc. Indeed in the case of strong coupling one expects a central elastic contribution to remain above T CDW1 , however accompanied by a 'hardening' of the soft phonon mode when T increases. The phonon dispersion along this direction at higher temperature should show this behaviour. This experiment was successful, with the first measurements of lattice dynamics in this Bronze family. Whereas, the current data set do not allow us to give a decisive answer on the mechanism that plays for this particular transition and further measurements are required at higher temperatures. To complete this project, we plan to submit a new beamtime request to complete the temperature mapping and analysis of elastic vs inelastic contribution in the different CDW states.
