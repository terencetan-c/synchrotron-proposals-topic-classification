<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have studied the structure of the keratin intermediate filament (IF) network in eukaryotic SK8/K18 (IF free SW13 cells transfected with fluorescent keratin protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) at the nano-beam set-up at EH3 of ID13. The keratin IF is one component of the cytoskeleton. It provides a pronounced tensile strength to epithelial cells and thus prevents cell rupture as a consequence of external stress. In cells, keratin IFs form bundles and dense networks (see fluorescence micrograph in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) with bundle diameters between a few tens and a few hundreds of nm (measured by electron microscopy). Our goal was to probe the structure of individual bundles in the cell with a nano-focussed beam to obtain knowledge about characteristic length scales in the arrangement of keratin filaments to a bundle. Samples of freeze-dried cells grown on silicon nitride membranes were prepared and characterized beforehand. During sample characterization, the keratin network in SK8/K18 cells was visualized using fluorescence microscopy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) and interesting cells for x-ray measurements were selected. X-ray measurements were carried out in transmission geometry at a photon energy of 15.25 keV. The beam was focussed to 140 x 110 nm² (h x v) using the crossed nano-focusing refractive lens system, yielding a primary beam intensity of ~3x10 9 photons/s. Taking advantage of the high-magnification beamline microscope and the precise sample stage, the samples were positioned in the focus of the beam. After a coarse mesh-scan over a large sample area (not shown), region-of-interest-scans with a small step size on the order of 200 nm with long illumination times were performed. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> shows a dark field image reconstructed from a mesh scan on the keratin-rich "arm" of the cell in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> with a step size of 250 nm. The total diffraction signal on the cell's "arm" is significantly higher than the background scattering. A composite image of all diffraction patterns from this scan (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> and the magnified region in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>) shows a high degree of oriented scattering in each diffraction pattern on the cell's "arm" corresponding to an aligned arrangement of keratin filaments in the bundles. In the magnified image the pronounced scattering at the outermost edge of the cell is clearly visible. Further steps in analysis include radial integration of diffraction pattern to determine intensity maxima corresponding to characteristic length scales or distances in the sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>. We also performed measurements using the same setup on a different biological sample, auditory stereocilia isolated from the mammalian inner ear. These hair cells´ protrusions are filled with a highly ordered array of actin filaments and our goal is to characterize these structures. By running a mesh scan with a step size of 200 nm on the freeze-dried stereocilia visible in the fluorescent image (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>, inset) we have reconstructed the correspondent dark field image (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). The total diffraction signal on the structures is not as high as for the SK8/K18 cells (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Nonetheless, oriented scattering that varies between different regions of the sample is observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref> shows the magnified composite image of region E from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). Single diffraction patterns from this scan reflect the predicted predominant direction of the actin structure in the selected spots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Prof. Dr. Sarah Köster*, Britta Weinhausen*, Dr. Valeria Piazza*, Jens Nolting*, Marius Priebe* Institute for X-Ray Physics, University of Göttingen</figDesc></figure>
