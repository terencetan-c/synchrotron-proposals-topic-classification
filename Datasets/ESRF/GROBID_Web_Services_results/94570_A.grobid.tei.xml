<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context and motivation of the research</head><p>When introducing a Co1-xAl2+2x/3O4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) spinel or a CoZr4(PO4)6 pigments in a porcelain glaze, the pigment reacts with the vitreous matrix and gets partially dissolved, changing the chemistry of the glaze, the crystal phases present and the resulting colour and possibly causing the devitrification of the glaze. This work aims at better understanding the reactions that take place and how to avoid them.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>List of the analysed samples with some details on their preparation (powder, cross-section…)</head><p>Co1-xAl2+2x/3O4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) and MZr4(PO4)6 (M = Co, Cu) pigments were prepared and introduced into porcelain glazes (33 wt% of pigment and 67 wt% pf PbO-B2O3-SiO2 glass, fired at 880 °C). Powder samples of the pigments (in 500 µm capillaries) and glazes (in 300 µm capillaries) were analysed at ID22. 13 powder samples were analysed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main results obtained</head><p>The Co1-xAl2+2x/3O4 pigment has a spinel structure with a tetragonal distortion. CoAl2O4 was analysed and the structure of γ-Al2O3 was solved. It follows the group space I41/amd with occupation of Oxygen atoms in 16h site and Al atoms in 8d, 8c, 4a, 8e and 16g sites. Co0.25Al2.5O4 pigment and corresponding glaze were analysed. The pigment consists of two spinel phases, one close to CoAl2O4 and the other close to γ-Al2O3. The structures of both these phases were solved.</p><p>Once put in the glaze, the γ-Al2O3 reacts with B2O3 of the glaze to create Al4B2O9 crystals and cause the devitrification of the glaze. Similarly, both CoZr4(PO4)6 and CuZr4(PO4)6 were analysed, and their structure solved. They are nasicon-type compounds and follow the same structure as NiZr4(PO4)6. Once put in the glaze, these pigments react with it to form ZrSiO4 and PbZr4(PO4)6. This latter product's structure was also solved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eventual communication of results (manuscript in preparation, conference…</head><p>This work is part of a PhD project and will be presented in two papers, one about the reactivity of Thénard Blue pigments in a porcelain glaze and another about MZr4(PO4)6 (M = Co, Cu) pigments and their stability in a porcelain glaze.</p></div>		</body>
