<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>HPr-kinase/phosphorylase is a bacterial Ser/Thr kinase which has no sequence similarities with other known protein kinases. Sugars enter the cell via the PTS system, then glycolysis produces FBP which activates phosphorylation of the small protein HPr on residue Ser-46, catalysed by HPr-kinase. Further interaction of P-Ser-HPr with the transcription regulator CcpA activates the carbon catabolite repression signalisation pathway. The aim of this study is to understand the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme HPrkinase/phosphorylase.</p><p>In 2000, we solved the structure of the enzyme at 2.8 Å resolution by MAD. Here we collected a 2.5 Å native data set, which has allowed us to improve the quality of the structure. In addition, we collected 2 data sets of a new crystal form, but the data were of insufficient quality for structure solution.</p><p>Marie-Helene Le Du, Marc Graille, Paula Llinas, (1.5 shift)</p><p>The parasite Toxoplasma gondii is responsible for toxoplasmosis, a worldwide infectious disease that can be life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals and in pregnant woman. The protein P30, present at the surface of the invasive form of the parasite plays a major role in parasite attachment to the host cell. Then, the crystal structure of the complex between P30 and the Fab of a neutralising antibody is of biological importance to map the epitope responsible for parasite entry in the host cell. No protein of known structure possesses a sequence identity sufficiently important to be used as a model to solve the structure by molecular replacement method. Previous crystals of the P30-Fab complex had diffracted to 4.3 Å resolution. No data set have been collected. However, heavy atom derivatives were tested but the crystal diffracted poorly (4.5-5 Å). Then, we need to collect native data set to a higher resolution and to obtain phases from MAD or MIR to solve the structure.</p><p>The human urokinase receptor, a highly glycosylated protein, plays an important role in cancer and cell invasion. The elucidation of the structure will be of great importance in the diagnosis and therapy in cancer. This receptor in complex with different peptides crystallise in a cubic space group and one of these complexes contains an anomalous scatterer (Hg). We had previously collected a MAD data set (3.9 Å) from this complex at BM 30 and we wanted to improve this resolution in ID 14-4. We tested the complex that contains the anomalous scatterer and some heavy atom derivatives (and anomalous scatterer) but they did not diffract at better resolution than we already had.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Sonia FIEULAINE*, PhD student, Ines LI de la SIERRA-GALLAY*, Post-Doc, Joel Janin, Professeur Universite Orsay, Laboratoire d'Enzymologie et Biochimie Structurales (LEBS), CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette Marie-Helene Le Du*, CEA, Marc Graille*, PhD student, Paula Llinas*, PhD student, Dépt.
