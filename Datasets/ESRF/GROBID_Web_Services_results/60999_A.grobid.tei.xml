<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The objective of our experiment was to use holotomography to determine the intrinsic porosity of calcium phosphate cements at the micro scale (pore size between 0.01 and 10 µm). For this purpose we prepared 200 µm thick and 2 mm length sticks of calcium phosphate cement using coarse and fine powder (liquid to powder ratio = 0.35). The folowing SEM images show the micro structure of the material (using coarse powder at the left and using fine powder at the right):</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2µm 2µm</head><p>We scanned two specimens, one of coarse powder and one of fine powder, using three different sets of parameters for each specimen in order to determine the configuration that allow us to capture the porosity. The scanning parameters and the corresponding image reconstruction are shown in the following table : 

Coarse powder Fine powder The images obtained had artifacts (rings and shadows) that make not possible to discretize between pores and material. In order to improve the quality of the images, thicker specimens of cylindrical section must be fabricated. However, we do not have the technology required to do it. The problem of the ring artifacts have to be solved.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>• X-ray energy: 17 keV • Scanned volume: 50 µm side length • Nominal isotropic voxel size: 50 nm • Number of projections: 3000 Setting 3: • X-ray energy: 17 keV • Scanned volume: 100 µm side length • Nominal isotropic voxel size: 100 nm • Number of projections: 3000</figDesc></figure>
