<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Eu1-xCaxTiO3-δ solid solutions are novel and promising thermoelectric (TE) materials produced in pure form by the proponent group. Partial substitution of Ca 2+ for Eu 2+ results in interesting physical properties, because the lattice thermal conductivity κL decreases dramatically, while the electrical conductivity σ is significantly enhanced at RT leading together to an increased figure of merit ZT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Xiao18]</ref> The latter effect is linked to additional point defects formation that increases the charge carrier concentration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Xiao18]</ref> Possible explanations for the huge reduction of κL are, e.g., the "rattling" of Ca 2+ in the AO12 cuboctahedron due to the much smaller ionic radius of Ca 2+ leading to underbonded Ca 2+ cations or local symmetry breaks in respect to the average structure. Both structural modifications should deeply affect the phonon scattering rate.</p><p>In order to understand the physical properties of Eu1-xCaxTiO3-δ solid solutions, an accurate determination of their crystal structure at different length scales is vital to any further investigation on this novel and promising TE materials to reveal the T-x stability ranges of different structures and the mechanism of phonon scattering. Despite this, no crystallographic study on this solid solution as a function of T and x (the structural phase diagram) is present in the literature.</p><p>The aim of this experiment was to establish the previously unstudied structural phase diagram of Eu1-xCaxTiO3-δ as well as the local deviations from the average structure, in order to relate the TE properties to their structure. Data collected during experiment CH-5342 have been partially published by the proponent group in Refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Xiao18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Widenmeyer20]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Samples</head><p>Eu1-xCaxTiO3-δ solid solutions (where x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) were synthesized using a modified Pechini method followed by annealing the samples at 1273 K and sintering at 1623 K-1673 K for 10 h under reducing conditions (10% vol. H2 in N2) as described in Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Xiao18]</ref> and references therein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Data collection strategy</head><p>High resolution Powder X-Ray Diffraction (PXRD) data were collected at the ID22 beamline of the ESRF on powdered samples of Eu1-xCaxTiO3-δ (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) using an X-ray wavelength λ = 0.35439(1) Å and a 9-element detector array. A cryostream and a blower were used to collect patterns in low (100 K -423 K) and high (373 K -1268 K) temperature ranges, respectively. Data were collected in a wide Q range (up to 12.5 Å -1 ) at fixed T values (100 K, 200 K, 300 K, 373 K, 473 K, 573 K, 673 K, 873 K, 973 K, 1073 K, 1173 K, 1268 K) for Rietveld analysis. Fast patterns acquisition was applied in between couples of T values while heating at 5 K/min to follow the unit cell parameter changes.</p><p>The same samples were also measured at the ID15@ESRF for PDF analysis. Powder samples were loaded into 0.7 mm diameter quartz glass capillaries and mounted on a goniometric head on top of a rotation stage of the ID15A beamline of ESRF at 320.7 mm distance from the detector, a Dectris Pilatus 2M CdTe. Wavelength was λ = 0.123984 Å. Maximum value of momentum transfer used for PDF calculation was Qmax = 25 -26 Å - 1 . Also PDF quality patterns were collected at fixed T values (100 K, 300 K, and 973 K) and also while heating at 5 K/min.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Brief description of the structural model of the EuTiO3-CaTiO3 system</head><p>The structure of the end members of the solid solution has been widely investigated. At room temperature, EuTiO3 adopts the cubic undistorted perovskite structure (space group 𝑃𝑚3 ̅ 𝑚). In the cubic phase, the atomic sites are 1a Ti (0, 0, 0); 1b Eu/Ca (½, ½, ½); and 3d O (0, ½, 0). TiO6 octahedra share corners with six different TiO6 units, while Eu ions fill the cuboctahedral sites forming EuO12 units. Below ~ 235 K a cubic to tetragonal (space group I4/mcm) phase transition takes place [Allieta12] driven by the antiferrodistorsive tilting of TiO6 octahedra along the c-axis (a 0 a 0 c -using the Glazer notation [Glazer75]). The tetragonal cell vectors ao, bo, and co are obtained starting from the perovskite ones ap by the following axis transformations (1 1 0), (1 1 ̅ 0), (0 0 2) and their moduli are aT = √2ap, bT = √2ap, and cT = 2ap. Each cell contains four ABO3 formula units (Vo = 4Vp). CaTiO3 takes the same undistorted perovskite structure only at very high T values. Starting from the high temperature cubic phase, CaTiO3 transforms into the tetragonal I4/mcm space group around 1635 K and undergoes a further phase transition around 1512 K towards an orthorhombic space group Pbnm (ao = √2ap, bo = √2ap, and co = 2ap,) and is maintaining this last structure down to room temperature [Ali05, Yashima09].</p><p>Using the setting of Ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Baran96]</ref>, in the orthorhombic phase the Ca ions are in 4c (0+xCa, 0+yCa, ¼) site, the Ti ones are in 4b (0, 1/2, 0) site, while two different oxygen site exists: O(1) 4c (0+ xO(1), ½+yO(1), ¼ ), O(2) 8d (¼ +u, ¼+v, 0+w); this notation highlights the shifts of the atomic coordinates in respect to the same in the cubic phase. In Pbnm the TiO6 octahedra undergo an out-of-phase tilting with the same tilting amplitude ϕx (= ϕy) along x-and y-directions (which lie in the ap-bp-plane) and an in-phase-tilting along the z-direction ϕz, along the cp-axis. This tilting architcture is defind as a -a -c + , according to the Glazer tilt systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[Glazer75]</ref>. The tilting angles ϕx and ϕz are related to the u, v, w shifts of the equatorial O(2) atom by: 𝜙 𝑥 = tan -1 4√2𝑤 and 𝜙 𝑧 = tan -1 2(𝑢 + 𝑣).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results:</head><p>In the following we will focus mainly on a subset of compositions (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8) and to the Rietveld refinements of high quality patterns collected at 100 K and 300 K. For the EuTiO3 end member we refer to already published results [Allieta12]. Moreover, in case of Eu0.8Ca2TiO3 we will describe in more details its unexpected structural modifications as a function of T that reveals the importance of studying the structural phase diagram at different length scales to gain a correct picture of this system.  Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> displays the fitted unit cell parameters (top panels), tilting angles as defined above (middle panels), and isotropic atomic means square displacement parameters: Atomic means square displacement parameters, Amsd (bottom panels).</p><p>Rietveld refinements reveal that the structure of the Ca-richest samples (0.9 ≥ x ≥ 0.4) is orthorhombic with space group Pbnm at both 100 K and 300 K. At both temperatures, on lowering Ca concentration the tilting angles decrease and eventually the system undergoes an orthorhombic to cubic phase transition: the x = 0.2 sample holds the undistorted perovskite structure. The structure of the EuTiO3 end member is cubic at 300 K and tetragonal at 100 K [Allieta12].</p><p>The analysis of the refined thermal parameters reveals that almost all Amsd values display smooth changes as a function of composition (see bottom panels of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). The only exception is exhibited by the oxygen Amsd parameter of the x = 0.2 sample, which is almost twice as large as the other values. This suggest that some structural disorder should exist at the local scale for this sample. At 1268 K, i.e. at the highest T values reached during the experiment, only Eu-rich compositions (x ≤ 0.3) have the cubic perovskite structure, while samples with x ≥ 0.4 show either orthorhombic or tetragonal distortion, depending on composition. Eu0.8Ca0.2TiO3 shows a phase transition during heating from cubic (100 K &lt; T &lt; 592 K) to tetragonal on the long-range scale and back to cubic at T &gt; 846 K. It should be stressed that the phase transition at T = 592 K is reversible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Widenmeyer20]</ref> The PDF analysis of ID15 data allowed to relate this unexpected sequence of phase transitions to the local structure of Eu0.8Ca0.2TiO3: at 100 K it is composed of a complex nanodomain arrangement of Amm2-and Pbnm-like local structures with different coherence lengths. The competition between ferroelectrically distorted octahedra (Amm2 as in BaTiO3) and rigid, tilted octahedra (Pbnm as in CaTiO3) results in a cubic long-range structure at low temperatures. The discrepancy between local and average scale leads to a peak in Amsd values for Eu0.8Ca0.2TiO3 as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. More detailed investigations are reported in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[Widenmeyer20]</ref>. Some insight of the disorder at the local scale in the solid solutions Eu1-xCaxTiO3-δ come from the analysis of PDFs collected at ID15 beamline. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>(a) reports the experimental G(r) function collected at RT on selected samples (light blue circles).The first and second G(r) peak at around 1.95 Å and 2.75 Å represent the nearestneighbor Ti-O and A-O (A = Ca, Eu) distances, respectively; the third G(r) peak, around 3.3 Å, contains the A-Ti pairs. Local interatomic distances obtained by peak fits decrease more markly in respect to bond lengths obtained by Rietveld refinements passing from x = 0.2 to 0.9 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b-d</ref>)). In particular, shorter and more broadly distributed A-Ti distances reflect the larger orthorhombic strain and the smaller unit cell volume obtained by introducing Ca 2+ into the solid solution. The contraction of Ti-O and A-O bond lengths at the local scale clearly exceeds the Vegard-like compositional dependence inferred from the long-range structures and is an indicator of the chemical pressure induced on both the A-and B-sites.</p><p>Applying different structural models to the G(r) curve in the compositional range of 0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.9 (red curves in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref>) show that the extra contribution to locally stretched bond distances originates in the nature of the short-range distortions of Eu-rich samples. All G(r) curves are fitted up to r = 8 Å by a 2×2×2 supercell of the primitive cubic perovskite, in which atomic positions are refined within the symmetry constraints set by the Pnma space group, that is a differerent setting of Pbnm (both are n. 62), here chosen to get the c-axis unchanged while passing from the orthorhombic to the tetragonal structure.</p><p>The symmetry-decomposition of the refined Pnma phases into single-irrep distortion modes is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(e) and indicates which distortions contribute to the short-range structure at different compositions. The modes of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(e) are depicted schematically in Fig. <ref type="figure">3(f)</ref>. A detailed description of the modes analysis, is reported in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[Xiao18]</ref>.</p><p>The Ca-rich compositions (x ≥ 0.6) are dominated by two octahedral tilt modes (belonging to irreps 𝑅 4 + and 𝑀 3 + ) by which rigid TiO6 units rotate around one axis, accompanied by a scissor mode (𝑀 4 + ). The composition of these modes rationalizes the split, symmetric A-O peak observed in x = 0.8 and x = 0.9. As x decreased, the octahedral tilt modes are replaced by a quadrupolar distortion (𝑀 1 + ) driven by Asite disorder and by an unconventional tilt (𝑋 5 + ), also accompanied by a scissor mode (𝑅 5 + ). Unlike rigid octahedral tilt modes, the 𝑀 1 + quadrupolar distortion stretches all the out-of-plane A-O distances, forming the 4 + 8 distribution of distances observed in the G(r) for x ≤ 0.6. Both 𝑀 1 + and 𝑋 5 + tend to form ordered short and long Ti-O distances, thus causing the Ti-O peak to be more smeared out at low-x. The longer Ti-O distances detected at the local scale (see Fig. <ref type="figure">3(b)</ref>) can be explained by considering that the distortion of the TiO6 octahedra by the coupled 𝑋 5 + and 𝑅 5 + modes is needed to improve the B-site coordination sphere in absence of an octahedral tilt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlook and future developments</head><p>The high Q-resolution of the ID22 beamline coupled to the high energy and the fast data collection rate of ID15A beamline made it possible to study the mechanistic details of the crystal structural change of EuTiO3-CaTiO3 system at different length scales in a wide temperature range: 100 K ≤ T ≤ 1068 K, which is the T interval accessible using cryostream and blower as sample environments. Exploring this T range allowed to correlate the physical properties (in particular the thermoelectric ones) of Eu1-xCaxTiO3-δ compounds with their average and local structure. As an example, the observed coexistence of polar and tilted nanodomains in Eu0.8Ca0.2TiO3 could be responsible for the obtained decrease of the lattice thermal conductivity κL by giving the possibility for an enhanced phonon scattering rate. However, the latter requires further experimental verfification. As an outlook, it is anticipated to extend this investigation in order to complete the structural phase diagram of the EuTiO3-CaTiO3 system. On one hand, this would allow a complete analysis of all the phase transitions present in the system from the lowest T values, so saturating the order parameters of Pbnm distortion, up to the cubic perovskite structure. On the other hand, it would also reveal the origin of anomalies in the thermal conductivity of Eu1-xCaxTiO3-δ solid solutions recently detected at very low T. <ref type="bibr">[Xiao]</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1(a) reports a part of the XRD patterns collected at RT on all the selected samples about the cubic 220 reflection.
