<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>has a strong activity on hydrogen storage materials, involving many national and international collaborators. The strong position of the group is to a high degree based on the good access to neutrons for powder neutron diffraction (PND) using the PUS diffractometer at the Institute's own research reactor JEEP II. Synchrotron power X-ray diffraction (SR-PXD) has proven to be an invaluable supplement to PND due to its superior speed and resolution. The data acquisition times are typically 3 orders of magnitude shorter using the MAR345 image plate at BM01A compared to PUS at JEEP II. This allows in-situ investigations of chemical reactions that we cannot possibly follow with PND. In addition, the very high resolution offered at BM01B enables indexing and space group determination from complex structures where the problem with peak overlapping makes the task unmanageable with PND-or laboratory PXD data. So far, the predictable, long-term access to the beam lines at SNBL through the previous long-term projects 01-01-805 and 01-02-862 has been an invaluable supplement to our neutron diffraction facilities and the rest of our experimental activity. This report summarizes the results that have been obtained in connection with the project 01-01-863.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The mechano-chemical reaction between LiBH 4 and TbCl 3 or ErCl 3 in a molar ratio of 3:1 has led to the formation of new compounds. For both reactions the products were determined as LiCl and an additional cubic phase with lattice constants of 11.9 and 11.8 Å respectively, as was determined by laboratory X-ray diffraction. HR-SR PXD measurements at BM01B with a wavelength of 0.5032 Å confirmed the initial findings. The structures were solved by ab initio methods (FOX) in space group Pa-3 and were found to be novel, solvent-free rare-earth borohydrides, respectively Er(BH 4 ) 3 and Tb(BH 4 ) 3 . Rietveld refinement of the structure model with GSAS resulted in the following reliability factors: wR p = 6.54%, R p = 4.90% and chi 2 = 3.187 for Tb(BH 4 ) 3 ; wR p = 4.38%, R p = 3.45% and chi 2 = 1.672 for Er(BH 4 ) 3 . Soft constraints were applied for the geometry of the <ref type="bibr">[BH 4</ref> ] units, as well as common isotropic displacement factors for all hydrogen atoms. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the final state of the refinement procedure for both compounds. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> depicts selected interatomic distances and angles for both compounds. Table 1: Tb(BH 4 ) 3 and Er(BH 4 ) 3 are both isostructural to -Y(BH 4 ) 3 and consist of rare-earth ions surrounded by 6 [BH 4 ] units, resulting in a distorted octahedral environment. The Tb 3+ /Er 3+ cations themselves form a distorted cubic arrangement with the [BH 4 ] units oriented along the cube edges (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The lattice constant for Tb(BH 4 ) 3 is 10.9125(2) Å and lies in between those reported for Gd(BH 4 ) 3 and Dy(BH 4 ) 3 , which are 10.983(5) Å and 10.885(3) Å respectively. The lattice constant for Er(BH 4 ) 3 has been determined as 10.7790(7) Å, and is considerably smaller than that found for the Dy, Gd and Er compounds. The reduction in lattice constants (cell volume) for the series of GdTbDyEr borohydrides is a direct consequence of the decreasing ionic radii as a result of the lanthanide contraction. The experimentally determined lattice constants show a linear dependence on the ionic radii of the lanthanide ions, as is expected for a series of isostructural compounds. Both compounds currently await further characterization by Powder Neutron diffraction in order to obtain reliable information about the position of the hydrogen atoms.</p><p>The results will be published in a forthcoming article <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>More on CaB 2 H x : An intermediate obtained from the decomposition of Ca(BH 4 ) 2</head><p>A CaB 2 H x phase has previously been identified as an intermediate phase in the decomposition scheme of Ca(BH 4 ) 2 (see final report for long-term project 01-02-772).</p><p>Based on desorption experiments and difference Fourier mapping of synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction data, the full composition was suggested to be CaB 2 H 2 , and a structure model was proposed. However, recent theoretical calculations have indicated that the proposed structure is not stable and further investigations are required to verify the structure. The aim of the experiment carried out at SNBL was to improve that data quality for the high-angle region. Due to the short b-and c-axes of the unit cell, the 0kl, 0k0 and 00l reflections are scarce in the 2 region used for indexing and structure determination. Moreover, the phase always forms in a multiphase sample, and the Bragg intensities are relatively weak. A procedure with longer measuring times at higher angles significantly improved the diffraction data quality (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 Intensity (counts) scattering angle ( o ) New data old data Figure 2: Comparison of previously obtained diffraction data (red) and the new data set (black) measured with increased measuring time at higher angles.

The data sets are not corrected for a small difference in wavelength.</p><p>However, no new information from systematic absences could be obtained, and the data supports the previously reported results. Raman-and IR spectroscopy as well as neutron diffraction experiments have not contributed to further insight, and the next step is to perform elemental analysis using TEM and to continue the analysis on the improved data set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Formation of a fluorite-type hydride in the Mg-Ti-Co-H system processed by ball milling</head><p>Based on thin films studies it has been shown that the Mg-Ti-H system exhibits a high hydrogen storage capacity and a very good electrochemical performance. However, studies on the bulk material have not confirmed such outstanding properties so far. The synthesis of ternary or/and quaternary hydrogen containing phases with FCC type structure in the Mg-Ti-Co-H system have been performed to study possible Co induced changes in its kinetic and thermodynamic properties. (MgH 2 )Ti 0.5 Co 0.5 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) and (MgH 2 ) 0.7 (Ti 0.5 Co 0.5 ) 0.3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) powder mixtures were ball milled in a high-energy mill SPEX 8000 under Ar atmosphere. The asprepared samples were investigated at BM01B. The HR-SR PXD data show the formation of a fluorite-type structure in both samples. In (MgH 2 )Ti 0.5 Co 0.5 the fraction of hydrogen containing phase (a = 4.4226(9) Å) accounts for 25 wt.%. Apart from that, the presence of TiCo (75 wt.%) and TiH 0.7 (5 wt.%) has been confirmed. In (MgH 2 ) 0.7 (Ti 0.5 Co 0.5 ) 0.3 the abundance of FCC hydride phase with a slightly bigger unit cell volume (a = 4.427(1) Å) seems higher; however the presence of numerous additional phases hinder the Rietveld refinement significantly. The synthesis conditions need to be optimized in order to eliminate the occurrence of undesired phases and simultaneously retain a high fraction of the hydride. The structural characterization and detailed compositions of both samples will be the subject of further investigations in conjunction with powder neutron diffraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hydride formation in Mg-based systems processed by reactive milling</head><p>The possibilities to produce quaternary Mg-based transition-metal complex hydrides have been explored. Mg 2 Mn 1-x Fe x (x = 0.5, 0) elemental powder mixtures were ball milled in a reactive D 2 atmosphere (about 5 MPa). The results were compared with the formation of Mg 2 (FeD 6 ) 0.5 (CoD 5 ) 0.5 from Mg-Fe-Co powders. HR-PXD was previously employed to characterize the as-milled samples, pointing towards the formation of Mg-based transition-metal hydride phases. During subsequent in-situ SR-PXD measurements it was shown that the desorption products were Mg, Fe and an unidentified Mn-based phase. HR-PXD was therefore carried out on fully desorbed samples (after DSC up to 400 °C) in order to investigate in detail the phases formed during deuterium desorption.</p><p>As expected, the main desorption products are elemental Mg, Mn and Fe (see Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). A minor unidentified phase is also observed in the Mg 2 Mn 0.5 Fe 0.5 sample (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Weaker diffraction peaks of the same phase are also observed in the Mg 2 Mn sample (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), which contains a non-negligible amount of Fe due to impurities from the milling process. This suggests that the minor phase contains both Mn and Fe.</p><p>A comparison of the HR-SR PXD data with the in-situ SR-PXD data is currently being carried out to fully characterize this phase. The results will be presented in forthcoming international conferences.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Magnesium hydride compounds produced by Cryomilling</head><p>In spite of its high desorption temperature and slow kinetics, magnesium hydride MgH 2 is still a good candidate for hydrogen storage applications due to its high hydrogen reversible capacity (7.6 wt. %) and low cost. Many studies have shown that doping of MgH 2 with a small amount of additives such as fluorides can decrease the desorption temperature and improve the kinetic properties.</p><p>In this work, MgH 2 was mixed with 2 mol % of FeF 3 or NbF 5 and processed by mechanical milling at liquid nitrogen temperature (cryomilling). The samples with fluorides presented very fast kinetics and a drastic decrease in desorption temperature. Furthermore, the previous XRD analysis showed a decrease in intensity of the Bragg peaks of β-MgH 2 phase for the samples with fluorides compared to the sample without fluorides. In order to determine if this decrease in intensity was related to the crystallite size reduction, which could also be attributed as a positive effect of the fluoride addition, the samples were measured by HR-SR PXD and later on analyzed by the Rietveld method.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> displays the HR-SR PXD patterns for the "MgH 2 ", "MgH 2 +FeF 3 " and "MgH 2 +NbF 5 " samples. The inset in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref> shows that the Bragg peaks of the samples with fluorides are much broader than those of the pure sample. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref> depicts, as an example, the Rietveld refinement applied to the MgH 2 sample. The values for the average crystallite size (D) from Rietveld refinement of all samples are shown in table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ref>. As can be seen, the samples that contain fluoride show a drastic reduction in the crystallite size compared to samples without fluoride (38,58(6) nm). The average crystallite size for the "MgH 2 +FeF 3 " sample is 10,89(2) nm while for the "MgH 2 +NbF 5 " sample is 12,94(4) nm.</p><p>The high-resolution SR-PXD analysis followed by the Rietveld method confirmed that during the cryomilling process of MgH 2 the addition of fluorides (FeF 3 , NbF 5 ) can be used to reduce the crystallite size and to improve the kinetic properties.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The mechano-chemical reaction between LiBH 4 and YbCl 3</head><p>Ball-milling is a feasible alternative to wet-chemical methods in order to synthesize borohydrides, since it allows preparation of these materials without the need for additional solvents. This eliminates the existence of intermediate solvent-adducts that have to undergo heat-treatment in order to obtain the solvent-free materials.</p><p>The mechano-chemical reaction between LiBH 4 and YbCl 3 in a molar ratio of (3:1) was found to proceed without gas evolution, which indicated that ytterbium was kept in its original trivalent state, and that the reaction was conducted without decomposition of the starting materials. HR-SR PXD (BM01B) data were collected on samples with different milling times. In addition to the earlier reported phase, with very broad peaks and indexed in a cubic unit cell (space group P23, a = 6.2008(8) Å), two new phases have been identified. The sample obtained after 6 hours of milling can be indexed in a cubic unit cell with a = 10.705 Å in space group Pa-3. This phase has been identified as isostructural to the reported room-temperature modification of Y(BH 4 ) 3 . The sample obtained after 1 hour of milling includes a small amount of a phase that has been identified as isostructural to the reported high-temperature modification of Y(BH 4 ) 3 . These phases has been named α-Yb(BH 4 ) 3 and β-Yb(BH 4 ) 3 , respectively. β-Yb(BH 4 ) 3 crystallizes in the cubic space group Fm-3c with a lattice constant a = 10.883 Å.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: HR-SR PXD data for Er(BH 4 ) 3 and Tb(BH 4 ) 3 .
