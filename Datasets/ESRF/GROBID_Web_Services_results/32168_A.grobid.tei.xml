<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The high-pressure, high-temperature behaviour of iron has been investigated to 140 GPa and 3500K by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction with double-side laser-heated diamond anvil cells at. We found that only α-bcc, γ-fcc, and ε-hcp Fe can be clearly verified as the stable solid phases in the explored P-T range.</p><p>A lot of care was taken for sample preparation, made of a mixture of pure polycrystalline MgO and fine grained iron. This mixture was first hot pressed for 24 hours in very reducing conditions, so as to obtain a dense starting material free from any iron oxides. This sample was then subsequently thinned down to 15 µm and shaped into discs 30 µm in diameter, and finally loaded in diamond-anvil cell devices under a dry neon atmosphere in a 2000 bar gas vessel.</p><p>Diamond-anvil cells were then aligned on the newly installed double-sided laser heating set-up available at ID27 beamline. At pressure exceeding 85 GPa, ε-Fe is observed to P-T conditions approaching those existing in outer core. No evidence could be found for any phase transition toward d-hcp structure as previously reported by Saxena et al. (1995)  or to a Pbcm orthorhombic phase as proposed by Andrault et al  (1997). The diffraction pattern shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> is a perfect illustration of the quality of the pattern we were able to collect over the whole pressure range. Such a diffraction pattern can unambiguously be interpreted as a mixture of MgO and hcp-iron. In addition, all samples were recovered and prepared for some analytical TEM study, that have shown no significant reaction between iron and the MgO matrix.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: X-ray diffraction pattern collected at 105 GPa and 2600 K, at a wavelength of 0.26472 Å. Upper ticks denote MgO reflections whereas lower ticks correspond to hcp iron. A very small peak around a 2-theta angle of 9.3 corresponds to the most intense reflection for neon, quite weak at these extreme temperatures.</p><p>Within the P-T range examined, we did not observe a significant change with pressure or temperature on the c/a ratio of ε-Fe (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). This observation is quite in disagreement with theoretical calculations of Steinle Neumann <ref type="bibr">(2001)</ref>, that reported a large variation of this ratio with increasing temperature at high pressure. Our observation casts a new light on the change of anisotropy proposed by this theoretical approach, since the large change in c/a ration was a key feature in these theoretical calculations.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, we report a phase diagram where the triple point γ-ε-liquid is accurately determined with the use of periclase as an internal pressure standard. Our results slightly differ from a recent study by <ref type="bibr">Ma et al. (2004)</ref>, where no internal pressure standard was employed. Our measurements yield the triple point at around 90 ± 3 GPa.  <ref type="formula">2004</ref>). At high-temperature, blue dots stand for fcc-iron, pink squares for hcp-iron. The main feature is that the triple point γ-ε-liquid is shown to be at higher pressures than previously reported. Data analysis is almost completed now, and should provide a reliable P-V-T equation of state, as described in the original proposal. <ref type="bibr">Andrault et al., Science, 278, 831-834, 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">.
