<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1</head><p>CH-1211 Genève 4, Suisse Laboratoire de Cristallographie, Université de Genève, 24, quai Ernest-Ansermet 2 Mar. Sci. And Eng., Chem. And Metallurg. Eng. Dpt., University of Nevada, Reno, USA A flow in-situ cell has been set up in our laboratory in Geneva. This experimental setup allowed us to follow in-situ evolution of Li 3 N under gas such as hydrogen, deuterium or hydrogen/nitrogen (80/20) mixture. The gas dosing system used is schematized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. All components of the cell are stainless steel (type 316L). Powder samples of Li 3 N are introduced inside sapphire capillary tubes (OD = 1.52 mm, ID = 1.07 mm, wall = 0.23 mm, length = 7 cm) which one side is closed with a cap and the other side is mounted on a 'T-piece' with 1/16" Swagelok fittings connected on the goniometric head. Teflon ferrules are used to ensure sealing of the system. The 'T-piece' is then attached to the system via two peek capillaries to a stainless steel manifold via a second 'T-piece'. The use of peek tubing allows for a certain flexibility allowing rotation of the goniometric head when collecting SR-PXD patterns but also to put this system inside a glove box in order to fill sapphire capillary tubes. In a typical experiment, the sample placed onto the goniometric head and connected to the dosing system, was outgassed under a vacuum pressure of 10 -3 mbar at room temperature for few minutes in order to remove the argon gas provided from the glove box. The temperature was controlled with the Oxford Cryostream 700+. The pressure of gas was either adjusted in the manifold, and then added to the sample or a slight gas flow was kept to have a continuously flowing gas on the sample. Typical sequence of powder patterns has been collected 1 min after the gas introduction with an acquisition time of 30 s (rotation rate 1°. s -1 ) every 100 s. The in-situ synchrotron powder diffraction experiment concentrates on two objectives: the details of the intermediate phase Li 2-x NH 1+x including its ordering, and detail of the Li 3 N-H phase diagram. We have observed in the in-situ experiment the "Li-rich imide" phase Li 2+x NH 1-x . It appears as one cubic imide-like phase with much bigger lattice parameter. We have observed it at the beginning of the hydrogen absorption at 255°C up to 71 mbar of gas pressure, and of the hydrogen/nitrogen mixture at 290°C up to 160 mbar. Absorption of hydrogen at 290°C has been started immediately at 54 mbar, and the "Li-rich imide" phase has not been observed in this experiment. We have observed the "Li-poor imide" intermediate imide-amide phase Li 2-x NH 1+x . The structural model of the Li 2-x NH 1+x phase was refined in the same model as for Li 2 NH (F-43m) with the site 4a mixed occupied by NH 2-and NH 2 -anions. It has been modeled by the variable occupancy of H on 16e site with the composition constrain according to the charge balance Li + (2-x) (NH) 2- (1x) (NH 2 ) - x . This model has been later confirmed by the DFT calculations [1]</p><p>. Refinement of the Li-site occupation constrained negatively to the H-site occupation produce nice agreement with the powder diffraction data, and correlates well with the Li 2-x NH 1+x lattice parameter. The upper composition limit of Li 2-x NH 1+x at 290°C and 1.243 bar of hydrogen or 4.3 bar of hydrogen/nitrogen (80/20) mixture is Li 1.08 NH 1.92 which is close to the stoichiometric amide LiNH 2 . This upper limit is close to the thermodynamic equilibrium as it is observed at the end of the time dependent gas absorption. The lattice parameter at 290°C of Li 1.08 NH 1.92 is for both gases a = 5.10 Å, giving the volume/f.u. = 33.2 Å 3 . It compares better with the volume/f.u. = 33.2 Å 3 for stoichiometric amide LiNH 2 , than with the volume/f.u. = 32.3 Å 3 for stoichiometric imide Li 2 NH as observed at the end of hydrogen absorption at 290°C. At 255°C, the Li 4 NH phase forms since beginning (6.5 mbar of hydrogen) in parallel with Li 2 NH and without production of LiH. The two-phase region Li 4 NH and Li 2 NH have been identified between 6.5 mbar and 71 mbar at 255°C. At 290°C, the upper limit of the two-phase region is shifted to 104 mbar of hydrogen. At higher pressures, above the two-phase region Li 4 NH -Li 2 NH, the phase Li 4 NH disappears: At 255°C, the Li 4 NH phase disappears above 71 mbar when Li 2 NH splits into two cubic phases: Li 2 NH and Li 2-x NH 1+x and LiH starts to form at the same time. At 290°C, the LiH starts to appear and simultaneously Li 4 NH starts to disappear at 104 mbar but Li 2 NH splits into Li 2 NH and Li 2-x NH 1+x only at 818 mbar of hydrogen. Disappearing of Li 4 NH can be explained like reaction of Li 4 NH with hydrogen. When all Li 4 NH disappears, Li 3 N continues to react with hydrogen showing very slow kinetics of that reaction. In the hydrogen/nitrogen mixture, we observe the same formation and decomposition of Li 4 NH but at higher total pressure (~4 bar of the mixture). For 80/20 H 2 /N 2 mixtures we observe a significant enhancement of the reversible capacity (from ~ 3 wt.% H to ~ 10 wt.% H after 516 cycles at 528 K), as compared to cycling without nitrogen additives. We attribute this enhancement to the reaction of nitrogen with liquid lithium during cycling as the Gibbs free energies of formation of Li 3 N (∆G o =-98.7 kJ/mol) are more negative than that of LiH (∆G o =-50.3 kJ/mol). We propose that there occurs a continuous accumulation of the Li 2 NH phase as these materials are subjected to cycling in H 2 /N 2 atmospheres.</p><p>[1] J.C. Crivello, M. Gupta, R. Cerny, M.
