<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Street address: 6 rue Jules Horowitz, F-38043 GRENOBLE Cedex Telephone: +33 (0)4 7688 2552; Fax: +33 (0)4 7688 2020; e-mail: useroff@esrf.fr ESRF Experiment Report Form, July 1999</p><p>The spindle checkpoint insures fidelity of chromosome segregation by halting sister chromatid separation in cells with a defective mitotic spindle <ref type="bibr">(Shah and Cleveland, 2000)</ref>. Mitotic -Arrest Deficient (MAD) mutants impair the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to arrest cell cycle progression as a consequence of spindle damage. Homologous proteins in higher eukaryots are involved in functionally equivalent pathways. Vertebrate Mad1 and Mad2 associate with kinetochores in prometaphase, from which they detach in metaphase and anaphase, consistent with a role for these proteins in processes that monitor attachment of sister chromatids to the spindle. Human Mad2a is almost entirely spanned by the Horma domain. Its structure consists of a central helical layer flanked on one side by a large -sheet, and on the other by a long and irregular -hairpin. Several conserved Mad2 residues map to the solvent-exposed face of the large -sheet, and possibly identify the location of a binding site for interacting proteins <ref type="bibr">(Luo et al., 2000)</ref>. The interaction between Mad2 and Mad1 these proteins is extremely strong, and resilient to chaotropic agents and high salts.</p><p>Recently, we have been able to raise crystals of Mad2 in complex with a C-terminal region of Mad1. Structure determination and comparison with the unliganded structure will help us to define the structural bases of activation of Mad2 during spindle checkpoint activation. Although this project was not included in last year's application, we decided to collect data at the ESRF based on its particular scientific interest. Mad1-Mad2 crystallizes in two highly related monoclinic crystal forms, which share two of the cell axes, while the third axis undergoes a doubling in dimensions (we refer to these crystals as short-and long-axis). During our visits at the ESRF we have been able to collect a highresolution datasets from native short-axis crystals, and several datasets from crystals soaked in heavy atom derivatives belonging to either cell. We have also collected MAD data at the Se edge from a long-axis crystals (we don't seem to be able to obtain Se derivatives with a short axis). There are 56 Se atoms in the AU of these crystals. Data collection was complicated by a combination of relatively high mosaicity of the crystals (0.6Â°) and the fact that they orient in cryoloops with their long axis perpendicular to the spindle axis. This leads to poor completeness, especially at high resolution. We would now like to collect fresh data with improved freezing conditions, and with crystals oriented differently in the cryoloop, so to obtain a complete a somewhat higher resolution dataset. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Luo, X.,Fang, G., Coldiron, M., Lin, Y., Yu, H., Kirschner, M.W. and Wagner, G.
