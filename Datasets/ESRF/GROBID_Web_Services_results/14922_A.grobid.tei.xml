<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this beamtime we recorded element-specific spectra at the Fe and V L 3,2 edges for Fe/V superlattices grown on MgO(001). Our results provided information on three separate topics (i) the Fe and induced V magnetic moments (ii) the orbital magnetism of Fe to be compared with previous Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) experiments <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and (iii) the large increase of the magnetic moment at high fields and low temperatures in a Fe/V sample with very thin Fe layers, as described in our proposal. We structure our report respectively:</p><p>(i) Fe XMCD spectra are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> for 40 nm thick Fe (indicated as bulk), and Fe 4 /V 2 , Fe 4 /V 4 and Fe 2 /V 5 superlattices. The indices are numbers of atomic planes in each superlattice period. One sees that the Fe signal at the Fe 4 /V 2 sample is bulk-like. When the V spacer becomes thicker the Fe XMCD decreases and this decrease is even more pronounced for the sample with the 2 at. layers of Fe. These results elucidate the behavior of Fe at the interface with V. The decrease of the Fe XMCD signal and, consequently, Fe moment is understood as a change of coordination number in a ligand field model, in agreement with theoretical predictions <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. In Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> we show XMCD spectra from V in Fe 4 /V 2 . First of all, we note that the spectra quality is much higher than of previous ones recorded for V [3] due to the high photon flux and degree of circular polarization at the ID12B. The sample of Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the largest degree of V polarization. Since the V L-edges overlap and the standard XMCD analysis can not be applied, we measured the total magnetization of the sample by Vibrating Sample Magnetometry and subtract the Fe magnetization. A magnetic moment of -1.3µ B /atom was deduced for V. The negative sign indicates an antiferromagnetic alignment between Fe and V, in agreement with theory and previous experiments, see e.g. <ref type="bibr">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3]</ref>.</p><p>(ii) In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> we present the ratio of the orbital-to-spin magnetic moments (m L /m S ) for the Fe-bulk and four superlattices, two with 4 and two with about 2 at. layers of Fe, as indicated. One may notice that the m L /m S ratio does not change considerably from the bulk to the 4 at. layers. However, a large increase (by more than 200% compared to bulk) occurs by going to the samples with 2 Fe layers. This is in fair agreement with our previous publication based on <ref type="bibr">FMR data [1]</ref>. This is the first time in the thin film literature that results from the two techniques that may provide the m L /m S ratio, i.e. XMCD and FMR, are compared and satisfactory agreement between them is found.</p><p>(iii) In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> we see field-and temperature-dependent magnetization data deduced by analysis of the corresponding XMCD spectra for an Fe 1.6 /V 5 superlattice on MgO(001). Previous non-element specific measurements by SQUID and FMR revealed a large increase of the total signal the origin of which could not be identified. It is only with the current element-specific measurements that an unambiguous input to this problem could be given. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> a large field-induced increase of the Fe magnetization is recorded. The effect occurs at both 10 and 120 K. On the other, hand, the V polarization was very weak and therefore, we conclude that the effect is located at the Fe sites. The ultrathin and non-integer Fe layers of the sample could suggest a mixed ferro-and superferromagnetic type of behavior, see for example <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, the ac-susceptibility part of the proposal could not be realized due to non-perfect compensation of the stray remanent field of the 7 T magnet.
