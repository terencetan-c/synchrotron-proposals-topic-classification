<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the human body, cells and functional units are spatially limited by the cell membrane, a lipid bilayer with functional proteins. A lipid bilayer is a double layer consisting of amphiphilic molecules that order spontaneously, so that their hydrophilic head group points towards the aqueous cell matrix and the hydrophobic tail groups of two molecules are opponent. An intact cell membrane is essential for the correct cell functionality. Depending on their solubility and size, gas molecules can cross the cell barrier by diffusion through the membrane. Thus, the question of how diverse harmful substances can modify membranes is of eminent importance for the understanding of the basic mechanisms of malfunctions.</p><p>If one wants to reduce the complexity of the bilayer and gain access to more basic mechanisms, a wellestablished model system are simple lipid monolayers. These Langmuir layers are formed at the water-gas interface if certain lipids are applied carefully to the water surface. The head group is then oriented to the aqueous phase and the tail group is pointed to the gas phase.</p><p>We studied the pressure dependent effect of n-butane and octafluorpropane on the structure of stearic acid monolayers. Experiments were performed in the following way. 20ml of ultrapure water were filled into the experimental cell. 90 µl of a 1 mM solution of stearic acid in chloroform was applied carefully onto the water surface with a syringe. Reference measurements with a monolayer of stearic acid were recorded. Subsequently, the cell was flushed with the respective gas and pressurized. Then, a XRR and / or GID scan was performed. Because of the high flux at ID 10, only one measurement could be recorded on the sample, otherwise beam damage occured. Thus, a fresh sample was prepared for each measurement.</p><p>To obtain an estimate of the systematic error caused by the sample preparation, the pressure steps had to be reproduced several times, which is very time consuming. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a) shows the reflectivity of a pure water interface, a water interface with a stearic acid monolayer, and the water/stearic acid system at an absolute nbutane pressure of 1.44 bar at T = 10 °C. The reflected intensity is plotted versus q 2 z and is normalized by the Fresnel reflectivity. Figure <ref type="figure">1(b)</ref> shows the electron density profiles, normalized by the water electron density, obtained from a fitting procedure. While the water interface does not show any layer formation, the lipid monolayer can be clearly distinguished with its head and tail group on the red curve. However, when the system is pressurized with an absolute pressure of 1.44 bar of n-butane, the electron density in the region of the head and tail group is altered. While the electron density of the head group is broadened, the electron density in the tail region drops down. Thus, the gas molecules prefer to accumulate between head and tail group. However this result has to be verified.</p><p>A GID scan on the stearic monolayer shows a crystalline lateral structure with slightly tilted tailgroups, detectable from the peak at q par ~ 1.5 Å -1 in Figure <ref type="figure">1(c</ref>). While peaks can still be observed at lower gas pressures, no peak is detectable on the GID scans at 1.45 bar of n-butane in Figure <ref type="figure">1(d)</ref>. Thus, the lateral structure of the Langmuir layer is more and more affected with increasing gas pressure.</p><p>Similar experiments were performed on a stearic acid monolayer in the presence of octafluorpropane (C 3 F 8 ). From the GID scans in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a) and (b), it is visible that the Bragg peak around q par ~ 1.45 Å -1 disappears if the pressure is increased to an absolute pressure of 2 bar. This result reveals that the lateral order of the Langmuir layer is destroyed by the increasing pressure. A more detailed data analysis is currently in progress.</p><p>In conclusion, these first measurements show the feasibility of XRR and GID on Langmuir layers under increased gas pressure. We detected a modification of the Langmuir monolayer structure and found that from a certain critical pressure on, the Langmuir layer collapses. The reflectivity measurements show that the gas molecules penetrate the Langmuir layer also at low gas pressures. They seem to accumulate between head and tail group of the lipids. This accumulation goes in hand with the destruction of lateral crystalline order. However, additional experiments are needed to verify the results and to investigate and understand in more detail the interaction mechanisms between gas and Langmuir layer, for example by using gases with a different radius of gyration.
