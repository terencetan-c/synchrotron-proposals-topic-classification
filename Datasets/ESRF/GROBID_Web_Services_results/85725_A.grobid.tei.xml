<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Every year, 12 million dental implant are placed worldwide (in Germany approximately 800.000/year) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Up to 47 % of these implants develop an inflammation of the surrounding tissue <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. These inflammations require further medical invention with negative impacts on life quality and high cost for the health care system. Titanium based alloys are the most common dental implant types. The role of implant derived Ti nano-particles (NP) and especially the role of the Ti-NP size, Ti distribution (intra-vs extracellular) and speciation (anatase vs rutile) were still not clear during the course of inflammation <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. Recently also ceramic based dental implants which provide very good mechanical properties and low failure rates <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> are inserted, commonly made of Yttria stabilised tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (YTZP). During our experiment we investigated the dental implant derived particle distribution in the peri-implant tissue that showed inflammation. The elemental information, distribution and size of expected NP or small congregations containing Al, Ti, V and YTZP has been investigated at ID16B and ID21. In addition Ti speciation has been investigated at ID21.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental setup ID21:</head><p>Beam size was about 0.4 µm (vertical) x 0.9 µm size (horizontal). Energy for ceramic samples was 2.4 keV (plus a higher harmonic at 7.2keV), for the Ti-containing samples we worked at an energy of 5.1 keV.We have scanned a total of 15 samples of peri-implant tissue with inflammation extracted from different patients, 7 of which have a Ti implant and 8 have a YTZP implant. We have collected overview maps at between 5 µm and 25µm resolution (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 B</ref> and <ref type="figure">C</ref>) to identify ROI's for further investigations at 2 µm, 1 µm, and 0.5 µm resolution (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 D</ref> and <ref type="figure">E</ref>). Furthermore we have collected XANES for Ti particles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The preliminary data analysis suggests:</head><p> Presence of both Ti and YTZP particles in peri-implant regions of sizes ranging from below 1µm to up to 10 µm  Ti particles speciation, derived by XANES, revealed different TiO2 structures, one example is shown in fig 1 F, a detailed analyses is ongoing.</p><p>ID16B: Beam size was 60 nm x 60 nm, energy was 29.6 keV. We have scanned a total of 7 samples of periimplant tissue with inflammation extracted from different patients, 3 of which have a Ti implant and 4 have a YTZP implant. These samples had already been scanned during the ID21 experiment, and we investigated the same ROI's.</p><p>We collected measurement with a resolution of 2 µm and 1 µm in order to identify their location, and then collected precise scan with a resolution of 60 nm (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 G</ref>).</p><p>The preliminary data suggests :  What appeared as a single particle of µm size at ID21 is actually a cluster of smaller NP which can be smaller than 60 nm  The co-localization of Zr and Y in individual particles confirms the provenance from the dental implant</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions/discussion</head><p>The beamtime went technically extremely well and the results are very promising. This study confirms the complementarity of the two beamlines ID21 and ID16B for this kind of samples. We detected Ti NP in all 8 samples of tissue surrounding Ti implants, and YTZP NP in 5 of the 8 samples of tissue surrounding YTZP implants. These experiments confirm the release of Ti NP around dental implants, and, to our knowledge, this is the first study addressing the release of YTZP NP around dental implants. Currently, immunohistological tests matching the fluorescence maps are ongoing to pinpoint immune cells in particle-containing regions.</p><p>The precise information about Ti particles speciation opens possibilities for better toxicology tests. A publication for a high impact journal is in preparation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>[ 1 ]</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 (left): ID21: Distribution of Ti-NP in a peri-implant tissue.
