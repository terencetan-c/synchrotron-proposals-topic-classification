<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Solid supported membranes were investigated in aqueous environment by means of x-ray reflectivity and fluorescence microscopy. Simultaneous studies with both methods were conducted at ESRF using a microfluidic setup <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Motivation: Lipid bilayers which are composed of lipids with high and low phase transition temperatures (T m ) show phase separation over a wide range of temperature and composition. Free lipid vesicles may have separate solid (gel) and fluid phases, together with a third intermediate state (the liquid-ordered phase) which is induced by the presence of cholesterol <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Our main goal was to find evidence for liquid-liquid coexistence in lipid bilayers on solid supports and to characterize these systems on a nanoscopic and microscopic scale. We have studied mixtures of cholesterol, saturated sphingolipids (high T m ) and unsaturated phospholipids (low T m ) in various stoichiometric ratios on smooth silicon wafers (average roughness 2 Å). Lateral phase separation, which was previously observed by our group on less smooth wafers (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>(a)), could not be observed on these substrates at first. However, after insertion of GM 1 -ganglioside into the bilayer, a change in membrane structure was detected (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>(b+c)) together with the appearance of small domains (Fig. <ref type="figure">1(d))</ref>. GM 1 is a marker lipid that is known to partition into liquid-ordered phases. Our results are manifold: The preparation of fluid, homogeneous membranes and their phase behavior depends critically on the substrate morphology. Lateral ordering is inhibited on ultra-smooth substrates, probably due to restricted possibilities for membrane fluctuations. We have shown that insertion of glycolipids such as GM 1 may overcome these inhibitions by inducing conformational changes in the membrane.</p><p>ESRF Experiment Report Form July 1999 At lower cholesterol content, such lipid domains are expected to be of sub-microscopic scale. We have carried out several attempts to resolve nanoscopic structures by grazingincidence diffraction. Unfortunately, the off-specular signal gain from single supported bilayers was insufficient for a quantitative evaluation. For future experiments, we suggest the application of strong marker lipids (e.g. gold conjugated phospholipids) which may yield sufficient contrast to resolve separate phases in single bilayers.</p><p>During this experiment we could optically investigate beam damage effects due to excess illumination. Membrane homogeneity and defects prior and after illumination were studied using fluorescence microscopy.
