Most crystals were part of the main project (structure-guided design of ethionamide booster), while other ones were of three side projects (more details described below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General report:</head><p>Objectives:</p><p>Samples from four different projects were investigated during the two series of measurements (the two MX1960 shifts).</p><p>• 1. High-throughput screening campaign of inhibitor targeting the Mycobacterium tuberculoisi repressor EthR2.</p><p>We have previously showed that manipulating the transcriptome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) using small molecules as modulators of the repressor EthR has the potential to increase the therapeutic index of the second line drug ethionamide (ETH).</p><p>Recently, we have expanded this concept and discovered that inhibition of a second transcriptional repressor, EthR2, leads to the awakening of a new ETH bio-activation pathway and to the reverting of the acquired and innate ETH-resistance. We are currently developing EthR2-inhibitory compounds. The aim of the two MASSIF-1 shifts is to collect a large number of datasets of EthR2/inhibitor to drive medicinal chemistry towards new EthR2 modulators for a combination therapy against Mtb.</p><p>• 2. Structural investigation of the interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis MabA (FabG1) and a series of drug candidates.</p><p>We are trying to get crystal structures of MabA protein in complex with several new inhibitors. This protein represents a target of choice to a drug discovery program against tuberculosis.</p><p>• 3. Structural investigation of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis target protein not yet structurally studies (starting project).</p><p>We have over-expressed and purified an essential M. tuberculosis protein not yet studied by X-ray or NMR, in order to develop a structure-based design program targeting this protein.</p><p>• 4. Molecular mechanisms of the yeast Mep2 ammonium transport.</p><p>Optimal production conditions have been developed to obtain the Mep2 membrane protein in fully-active form. We would like to solve the crystal structure of an active form, that should provide important insights into the transport mechanism.</p><p>Results and the conclusions of the experiments:</p><p>• 1. EthR2.</p><p>More than 50 structures in complex with different inhibitors were solved and refined at high resolution ranged from 1.3 to 2.5 Å. As a result, the bound ligands were perfectly well defined in the electron densities, allowing reliable modeling and robust analysis of the protein-ligand interactions. Clearly, the objectives of the experiment were fully achieved.</p><p>The obtained structures will be described in at least four papers, that are being written (expected publication in 2018).</p><p>• 2. MabA.</p><p>Twelve crystals were tested and only four diffraction data were collected. However, the crystal structures were solved and refined at only low resolution, and even more critical, we failed again to obtain structures containing ligands. In conclusion, after all our attempts, we decided to stop trying to determine the MabA structure in complex with small compounds or ligands.</p><p>• 3. Starting project.</p><p>Eigth crystals obtained from our initial crystallographic screens have been tested durng the second shift MX1960. Only two crystals gave diffraction but the inferred unit cell parameters indicated that these were crystals of small compounds. Further crystallographic screenings are currently in progress.</p><p>• 4. Mep2.</p><p>Nine crystals were tested and only 3 diffraction data was acquired. Unfortunately, the solved structures turned out to be the structures of a yeast contaninant protein. We are continuing to focus our efforts on improving Mep2 protein production and purification.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):René Wintjens, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium Alexandre Wohlkönig, Vrij Universiteit Brussels, Belgium Alain Baulard, Pasteur Institute of Lille, France</figDesc></figure>
