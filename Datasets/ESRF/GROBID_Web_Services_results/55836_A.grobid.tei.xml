<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have produced a diluted (less than 10 atomic %) Fe-nanoparticled system with very interesting magnetic properties. In this samples, the Fe structural data has been masked by a huge contribution coming from the noble metal matrices (Au, Ag or Cu). The aim of the experiment was to extract the crystalographic Fe information by tunning the incoming X ray energy to the matrix absorption to reduce their contribution to the XRD pattern steaming from the matrix and therefore been able to extract the "hidden" Fe structure.</p><p>The experiment began with some beamline work originated by a compleat blackout of the current the previous day. The first 8 hours were used to reconfigurate the beamline and setting up the experiment conditions, since some of the encoders were out of position due to the power cut. We started the experiment tunning the X-ray beam energy out of the resonance of any of the absorption edges of any of the metals present in our samples (i.e., Au, Ag, Cu and Fe), E = 16.148 keV, which produces a wavelenght of λ = 0.7677 Ǻ. After setting up the desired energy, the diffractometer was aligned and the first sample (Fe 7 Au 93 ) was set in place and the off resonance X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded, ending with the first day of experiment. During the second day we swap samples (Fe 7 Ag 93 and Fe 9 Cu 91 ) . It is worth mentioning that we count for long times (around 12h for each spectra) because the low wavelenght used for the off-resonant experiment grant access to a d-space where there is a sole peak of Fe. However, despite the long counting time we were not able to observe it.</p><p>During the third day we start to swap energy, initially to the L 3 -Au edge. For stabilising clearly the beam energy we run a transmission experiment through a Au refence foil. We test it with the Fe 9 Cu 91 sample (since all the films have a 3 nm Au capping layer), and try to observe if tunning more precisely the energy will produce a drop in the peak steaming from the Au capping layer, failing to observe any difference. Since the Ag K energy edge was out of the beamline capabilities our next step was moving to the Cu K-edge. The effect in the K edge was much stronger than in the L3 edge, observing a big decrease in the Cu peaks, as can be observed in the Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. We adquire statistics for the rest of the beamtime.</p><p>The CCD camera was not used by strong recomendation from the beamline responsible Germán Castro, so we did not check the possible preferential orientations in the film. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig 1.
