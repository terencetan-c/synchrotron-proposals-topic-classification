<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Hehlen Bernard, Laboratoire Charles Coulomb, University Montepllier 2 Maryam Al-Majzoub, Laboratoire Charles Coulomb, University Montepllier 2 J-M. Kiat, Ecole centrale Paris Ali Al-Zein, ESRF Report: Four ceramics of SrTiO 3 (STO) with controlled grain size have been investigated. The first one corresponds to the commercial micrograin powder which has been sintered, and the three others have been obtained by ball-milling the aforementioned commercial material, either in ZrO 2 or WC (tungsten carbide) bowl, to reduce the grain size down to nanometers [Ref 1]. The obtained nano powders are then compacted under moderate pressure and sintered with different temperature cycles providing their final grain size. Two ceramics with grain size of 1-2 m synthesized with slightly different routes (STOm(ZrO) and STOm(WC)) have been prepared. The third sample has a grain size of about 30 nm and is called STOnm(ZrO). The ceramics are then crushed into powder to use the 1mm diameter capillary at ID31. All experiments were performed at incident wavelength =0.4 Å. Diffraction patterns were collected between 2=5° and 90° at five temperatures between 10 K and 300 K. In addition [400], [440], and [222] Bragg peaks, as well as [3/2 1/2 1/2] and [5/2 3/2 1/2] super-structure peaks, were recorded at more than 10 intermediate temperatures with special attention between 10 K and 150 K. The lattice parameter of the two micrograin ceramics are shown in figure 1 (before instrumental corrections). One clearly observes a splitting on cooling, attributed in the bulk material to the well known cubic-totetragonal transition. However, it seems that the splitting occurs at ~140 K in STOm(ZrO) and ~90 K in STOm(WC), values which should be compared to T c =105 K in the single crystal. This and the different temperature dependences point-out different structural properties between the two prepared ceramics. These differences can also be observed in a plot of the tetragonal distortion c/a-1 presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The latter is compared to the square of the primary order parameter  corresponding to the tilting angle of the TiO 6 octahedra below T c , and proportional to the area of the superstructure peaks. c/a-1 and  2 overlap in STOm(WC), and profile matching followed by a Rietveld refinement of the full diffraction pattern at 10 K is compatible with the tetragonal I4/mcm space group of a SrTiO 3 single crystal. On the contrary c/a-1 and  2 do not match at all in STOm(ZrO) suggesting a different crystalline structure in that sample. This assumption is further supported by the splitting of the [hhh] Bragg peak at 10 K (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> inset) and by the strong broadening of the superstructure peak on cooling (not shown). It is worth noting that c/a-1 measured by X-ray diffraction matches with the soft TO-mode splitting,  2 A2u - 2 Eu , measured using hyper-Raman scattering [ <ref type="bibr">Ref 2]</ref>. For that sample the results of the profile matching and Reitveld refinement of the full diffraction pattern reveal that the structure is likely orthorhombic at 10 K with four competing possibility for the space group, three of them being polar and the other one not [ <ref type="bibr">Ref 3]</ref>. Diffraction patterns of the nanograin ceramic were also recorded. In that case the Bragg peaks are much too broad to observe any splitting limiting therefore a detailed analysis.</p><p>This experimental campaign has fully satisfied our expectations insofar it has been possible to measure simultaneously c/a-1 and . It was a challenging experiment since the former deserves high resolution and the latter (very) high luminosity. Our analysis highlights pronounced differences in the structural properties of ceramics having the same grain size but synthesized by slightly different routes. In particular, it confirms the anomalous behavior of STOm(ZrO) at low-T pointed-out previously by hyper-Raman scattering [ <ref type="bibr">Ref 2</ref>]. The refinement revealed that this sample exhibits an orthorhombic structure at low-T instead of the usual tetragonal one (I4/mcm). We believe this effect could be due to the strain field the shell imposes on the core grain. SrTiO 3 is a textbook example for phase transitions and the origin of these unexpected properties strongly motivates further investigations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Peculiarity of the antiferrodistortive phase transition in nano-and micro-ceramics of strontium titanateNames and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
