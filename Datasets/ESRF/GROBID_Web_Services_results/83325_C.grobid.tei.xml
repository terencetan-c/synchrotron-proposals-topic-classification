<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The present experiment is the continuation of a very successful project on studying lipid dynamics using inelsatic x-ray scattering. Our first experiment on pure DPPC bilayers performed at ESRF led to a high-impact publication in Nature Commun. <ref type="bibr">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr">11575)</ref> in 2016 (also featured as ESRF science highlight), where the discovery of a transverse phononic mode and the opening of a phononic gap upon the gel-fluid phase transition provide a direct evidence of the formation of short-lived local voids that enable permeation of small molecules through the membrane. We have recently extended the study to include binary systems, adding cholesterol to DPPC to study the effect of cholesterol concentration on the longitudinal and transverse membrane phonon dynamics in order to unveil the role of cholesterol in the mediation of dynamical processes in lipid bilayers. During the SC-4465 experiment at ID28 we successfully measured the series of binary mixtures of DPPC and Cholesterol at the following concentrations: DPPC:Chol(7%mol), DPPC:Chol(18%mol), DPPC:Chol(28%mol) at room temperature and at the elevated temperatures. The samples were prepared at ESRF PSCM laboratory. The measurements we performed in a custom made humidity chamber, whose mounting was made possible with help of ID28 technitians, who created custom adaptors to mount the chamber on the goniometer.</p><p>In the figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> we present the selected IXS spectra with the corresponding fittings using damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) model. For each sample (a single T/Chol%mol condition) we measured 2 different positions of the detector arm to achieve the ultimate Q resolution of ~1 nm -1 within the Q-range of up to 15 nm -1 , which corresponds to the first pseudo-Brillouin zone.</p><p>The raw S(q,0) scans with the analyzer #3 for three Chol concentrations at 25C are shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (left panel).</p><p>As expected, with increasing the concentration of Cholesterol, the width of the S(q) peak increases, which signifies the increased degree of disorder. Such behavior proves that the sample deposition was successful. The peak shift towards smaller detector angle (or smaller Q) with Chol%mol increase implies that the size of the pseudo-Brillouin zone reduces, which is explained by the increased amount of Cholesterol between DPPC chains and ultimate increase of the pseudo-lattice parameter of the DPPC-Chol system, as expected. In figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> (right panel) we present an example of the complete dispersion curve for DPPC:Chol7%mol system as a result of the fitting procedure with 3 DHO excitations. Green curve denotes the regular longitudinal acoustic mode whose inclination at the small Qs corresponds to the speed of sound (point 0,0 is shown for reference). Low laying black curve denotes the transverse acoustic mode previously discovered at our previous experiment at ID28 <ref type="bibr">(Nature Commun. (7, 11575)</ref>). Additional phononic branch denoted by the red curve is related to the influence of the cholesterol on the membrane dynamics and its evolution provides understanding of the dynamical signature of the lipid domains and their role in such processes like cell curvature generation, curvature sustainability and membrane bending rigidity. The results are under preparation for the publication: M. Zhernenkov et al. "Dynamic profiling of DPPC-Cholesterol binary mixtures underpins the biological functions of a cell membrane", ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) to be submitted to Nature Chem.
