<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of our experiment was to determine the nature of the features in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) of rutile (TiO 2 ) at the Ti-K edge using the resonant Borrmann Effect. Therefore the intensity of Laue reflections was measured at different energies around the Ti-K edge (4.966 keV). Previous experiments on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) have already shown that quadrupole absorption is strongly enhanced at certain Laue reflections. We used this effect to identify the quadrupole contribution to the observed pre-edge peaks of rutile. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a comparison of the quadrupole enhanced absorption spectrum and a conventional spectrum. Peak A, which can be hardly seen in the conventional spectrum, is a pure quadrupole transition. Peaks B and C have the same height in the conventional spectrum. In the Borrmann spectrum B is stronger than C. This suggests, that there is a quadrupole contribution to B.</p><p>The experiment was repeated at different temperatures in order to investigate the temperature dependence of the quadrupole enhancement. Theoretical calculations predict that dipole absorption will increase with temperature in the Borrmann case while quadrupole absorption does not depend temperature (at least in a first order approximation). This is in good agreement with the results shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>: While the absorption at peak A does not depend on temperature, a linear increase above 150K is observed for peaks B and C. From these results in can be concluded that peak A is a pure quadrupole transition, peak B is a mixed dipole quadrupole transition and peak C is a pure dipole transition.</p><p>The difference between the Borrmann spectra measured at the (020) reflection (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and the (011) reflection (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 left</ref>) is partly caused by the different values of F H F H for these reflections. The quadrupole absorption also depends on the azimuthal angle, which was different for the (020) and (011) measurements. We assume that this azimuthal dependency caused the stronger enhancement of peak B at the (020) reflection, however this could not be studied in full detail in beamtime HE-2778. A more thorough investigation is planned for future beamtimes.</p><p>We acknowledge the extensive support by the BM28 staff during our beamtime.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Absorption of TiO 2 at the Ti-K edge determined from Ti-K fluorescence yield (black line) and from the integrated intensity of the (020) Laue reflection (red line).</figDesc></figure>
