<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) is the photoreceptor protein in the purple membrane of Halobacterium salinarium. It acts as a proton pump, allowing the transformation of light into chemical energy. Purple membrane (PM) binds 5 mols of Ca 2+ per mol of protein that play important structural and functional roles. The extraction of these cations leads to a deionised form of the membrane that possesses characteristic features. The purple form can be regenerate by the addition of mono-, di-or trivalent cations. The research concerning the cation binding to the purple membrane has mainly been directed towards the using of several indirect techniques as for example NMR, Scatchard plots, DSC, but these techniques are unable to give structural and geometrical information about the coordination of the metals. In this sense, X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a direct technique to obtain information about the local structure around a metal. It allows to study purple membrane in solution, i.e. in an environment which is much closer to its physiological state. Also has the advantage of being element-specific and does not require a crystalline sample. The nature and location of the cation binding site is currently in dispute and is the subject of intense investigations by a number of research groups. Several three-dimensional models of bacteriorhodopsin have been published, but so far none of them gives any evidence about the bound cations because they are in part or completely lost upon crystallization. In contrast, all of these three-dimensional models show different Asp and Glu groups that in terms of geometry and bound distances are compatible with cation binding sites. In this sense our previous studies have shown: i) the presence of one site of high affinity and four sites of medium affinity and five sites of low affinity for Mn 2+ , ii) that the low-affinity sites are located on the BR C-terminal segment, and iii) by using EXAFS and XANES, that the binding sites are located in the protein and not in the lipidic region and more concretely that Ca 2+ in the high-affinity binding site is coordinated with oxygen atoms from Asp85, Asp212 and three water molecules (please, see references on the new proposal form and on our proposal Ref. SC/1776).</p><p>The present work describes the results of a study aimed at identifying candidate cation binding sites on the extracellular region of bacteriorhodopsin, including a site near the retinal pocket. The approach used in our work is a combined effort involving computational chemistry methods together with the Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) technique to obtain relevant information about the local structure of the protein in the neighborhood of Mn 2+ ions in different affinity binding sites. The results of the present work permitted the identification of a high-affinity binding site for Mn 2+ where the ion is coordinated simultaneously to Asp212 -and Asp85 -. Moreover, the results demonstrate that extracellular glutamic acid residues are involved in cation binding.</p><p>With the aim of searching the local environment of the high and medium-affinity binding sites of Mn 2+ in purple membrane we have measured the X-ray absorption spectra of deionized wild type (WT) and quadruple mutant bacteriorhodopsin (4Glu) regenerated with 1 Mn 2+ and 5 Mn 2+ per mole of BR, in order to fill only the high and medium affinity binding sites, respectively. In the quadruple 4Glu bacteriorhodopsin mutant, the four extracellular Glu residues have been mutated: E9Q+E74Q+E194Q+E204Q.</p><p>We have compared the cation binding in four different clusters of BR found in the GRID map and located in the extracellular region of the protein (external sites: Glu74 -; Glu9 -and Glu194 -/Glu204 -) and a site near the retinal pocket (Asp85 -/Asp212 -). The local environment of Mn 2+ in all these putative clusters is formed by carboxyl sidechains of Asp and Glu residues that had already been proposed as candidates for cation binding in BR). As a matter of fact, the EXAFS fittings results for PM regenerated with 1 Mn 2+ /BR molecule are consistent with the high-affinity binding site being located between Asp85 -and Asp212 -, for both pH values studied. For this site we find a quite similar average Mn-O distance for the two pH values of 7 and 10 (2.18 Å and 2.17 Å respectively), indicating that there is no change in the metal first coordination shell upon a pH increase. The average Mn-O distance found for Mn 2+ in the protein shows a difference of 0.03-0.04 Å with respect to the Mn-O distance for Mn +2 in water solution found here, which is a significative difference considering the same coordination number of 6. This implies that the first coordination shell for the metal atom is different when it is bound to the protein or is solvated by water molecules.</p><p>Comparison of EXAFS results at pH values of 7 and 10 for all the studied samples (WT1Mn 2+ ; WT5Mn 2+ ; 4Glu5Mn 2+ ) gives valuable information about the location of cation binding sites and on involvement of the mutated Glu residues. First, there is a strong similarity in the behavior of 4Glu5Mn 2+ with WT1Mn 2+ : the EXAFS spectra are similar and both show insensitivity on pH change. This suggests that both proteins have only one internal cation binding site. Second, EXAFS spectra of WT5Mn 2+ shows a strong change varying pH from 7 to 10, whereas 4Glu5Mn 2+ is insensitive to this change. Therefore, the internal site of WT1Mn 2+ or of 4Glu5Mn 2+ is not sensitive to pH, whereas some of the more external sites of WT5Mn 2+ are heavily affected by the pH change. Finally, the behavior of the 4Glu mutant is a strong evidence that some of the mutated Glu side chains are involved in the cation binding, in agreement with previous results, i.e. four of the 5 Mn 2+ added to the 4Glu mutant are not fixed by the protein and remain in water solution. They are then eliminated in the centrifugation process used in the sample preparation.</p><p>Summarizing, these results delineate the presence of at leats two binding sites for Mn 2+ in the purple membrane: one internal high-affinity site located in the vicinity of Asp85 -and Asp212 -, and an external site of lower affinity located near Glu194 -and Glu204 -. This hypothesis is in agreement with the results found in our previous works, where two different Mn-O distances (2.18 Ǻ and 2.49 Ǻ) for the 5Mn 2+ /BR sample are observed, in contrast with the distance of 2.17 Ǻ found after the retinal extraction that induce tertiary structural changes in the protein. This implies the existence of at least two different geometries for cation binding sites, in agreement also with other authors.</p><p>Relative energies of the metal binding sites predicted for Mn +2 GRID probes.</p><p>Fit parameters corresponding to the fits on the putative BR-clusters (see Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref>) and WT bacteriorhodopsin regenerated with 1Mn 2+ per mole of protein, at pH 7.</p></div>
