<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Methylmercury (MeHg), mainly produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), is biomagnified in aquatic food chains and poses a risk to human health. However, very little is known regarding the mechanism of inorganic Hg (Hg(II)) uptake and methylation by these organisms as well as the demethylation process. Our objective was to determine the Hg speciation in two SRB strains with contrasted methylation capacities to progress in the involved metabolic pathways. For that, we applied Hg L III -edge High Resolution X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (HR-XANES) and Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) using the new set up with Si analyzer crystals available on FAME beamline.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental:</head><p>Two anaerobic strains were studied: strain BerOc1 (Desulfovibrio dechloroacetivorans) able to both methylate Hg(II) and demethylate MeHg and strain G200 (Desulfovibrio desulfuricans) only able to demethylate MeHg. Bacteria were grown in a synthetic medium in anaerobic conditions. They were spiked with 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm Hg(II)Cl 2 (IHg) and MeHgCl (MeHg), and incubated for 24 h (growth parameters were followed in parallel to adjust the time of Hg exposure). Then, the culture was centrifuged, rapidly washed and prepared as frozen pressed pellets. Hg-references were also synthesized and analyzed as solid pellets or aqueous solutions. Samples were positioned in the He cryostat operating at 12K. Hg L 3 -edge XANES and EXAFS spectra were collected in fluorescence mode. To limit diffusion from background and increase Hg sensitivity, Hg Lα 1 fluorescence (L 3 -M 5 , 9988.8 eV) line was selected using 5 Si(111) crystals while the diffracted intensity was collected with a one Si detector.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and the conclusions of the study (main part):</head><p>Results confirmed the higher sensitivity of HR-XANES in comparison to standard fluorescence measurements. For instance, αHgS and HgO spectra have a pronounced near-edge peak at 12.286 keV (arrow in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> left) which is not present in standard fluorescence measurements and is characteristic of Hg(II) linearly coordinated <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Manceau et al., 2015)</ref>. This peak is absent in Hg 2 Cl 2 where Hg has a +I oxidation state and a 5 coordination, and when Hg(II) is tetracoordinated, for intance in βHgS or HgSe (not shown). Furthermore, the position of the near -edge peak depends on the nature of the ligands: it is shifted to a higher value when Hg is digonally bound to one methyl plus one other group (S, Cl, OH, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 right</ref>). HR-XANES spectra recorded on BerOc1 exposed to 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm IHg have different features, indicating that Hg speciation differs for the three conditions. Moreover, the near-edge peak at 12.286 keV is absent in the three BerOc1 cultures, and thus Hg is not linearly coordinated: the initial HgCl 2 species have been modified by the bacteria cultures and the assimilation and/or sequestration depends on the Hg level.</p><p>Comparison of these spectra with literature data suggests that tetracoordinated Hg such as βHgS (or at least a non negligible part of this species) could play a role in Hg associated to the bacteria, particularly for the 0.1 and 1 ppm IHg. Additional measurements are necessary to validate this hypothesis. EXAFS spectra (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>) confirm that Hg speciation is different in the three cultures, particularly for BerOc1 exposed to 10 ppm IHg, and radial structure functions also suggest that sulfur atoms can be present in the first Hg coordination sphere. Data treatment by linear combination fitting and determination of the structural parameters by shell simulations are in progress, and these data must be completed by measurements of other Hg references.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Justification and comments about the use of beam time:</head><p>The alignment of the five analyzer crystals is time consuming and 2 shifts were used for this step. The use of the cryostat also takes time since it is equipped with a single sample position and it is necessary to warm it up between two samples. Beamtime was dedicated to the measurement of different Hg standards and to BerOc1 exposed to three IHg concentrations. HR-XANES proved very powerful to discriminate Hg speciation. We have initially planed to investigate the non-methylating strain G200 as well as the exposure to methylmercury but 15 shifts were not sufficient for that. We thus applied for additional beamtime to carry on these encouraging results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publication(s):</head><p>Data treatment is still in progress (linear combination fitting and determination of structural parameters). We need additional data on bacteria exposed to MeHg and on the non methylating strain to have a global view for a high impact publication.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2: Hg L3--edge EXAFS spectra of BerOc1 exposed to 0.1, 1 and 10 ppm IHg compared to Hg--reference compounds (left) and Fourier transforms of the corresponding spectra (right).
