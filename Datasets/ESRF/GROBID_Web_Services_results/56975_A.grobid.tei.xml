While the shape in (a) corresponds to the shape of the diffracting grain of a microcrystal, the maxima in (b) correspond to the positions of individiual stacking faults. We have chosen a distict intensity maximum in Fig. 2b at x = 65 µm, y = 105 µm and perforned a detailed measurement of three-dimensional reciprocal map. Figure 3 (upper panel) shows a detail of the reciprocalspae map, in which the [0001]-oriented intensity rod is visible; the lower panel displays the intensity distribution along the rod.</p></div>

Acoording to the analysis published in our previous paper [1], diffuse x-ray scattering from these stacking faults is concentrated along [0001] rods parallel to the sample surface. For the investigation of the type of the SFs (intrisic types called I1, I2, I3 and extrinsic SFs denoted E -see [1] for details) noncoplanar symmetric diffractions H0-H0 are suitable, the defect rods disappear for any H=3n.The aim of the beamtime was to study individual stacking faults using a narrow primary x-ray beam with the diameter around 200nm and energy of 8.5 keV. For this purpose we investigated microcrystalline a-GaN layers with the size of individual crystals around 10-50µm. Figure1shows an optical micrograph of a typical microcrystal consisting of two single-crystalline grains with well-developed facets. The position of individual stacking faults in a selected microcrystal was determined by means of the fast Kmapping technique. In this method the 20-20-diffracted radiation was detected by a fixed two-dimensional detector during x-y scanning of the sample. Figures2a,bshow the results of the K-mapping of the crystal depicted in Fig.1.</figDesc></figure>
