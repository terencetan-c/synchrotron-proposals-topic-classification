<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The pressure-temperature covered during this experiment was 50-170 GPa and 2000-5500 K, with the purpose of determining eventual changes in the local structure and compressibility of liquid iron at the pressure of the triple point (~100 GPa). After laser heating and in situ XRD on ID27 beamline, samples were kept under pressure in the diamond anvil cell and mapped on ID24 to check for chemical reactions with carbon from the diamond, following the protocol established in [Boccato2020] and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Morard 2018</ref>]. The Fe sample was a 10 μm thick, high purity (&gt;99.99%) Goodfellow Fe foil loaded in a diamond anvil cell, between two previously dried KCl ~10 μm thick disks, which acted as pressure transmitting medium, as well as chemical and thermal insulators. The pressure was determined according to the thermal equation of state of <ref type="bibr">KCl [Dewaele2006]</ref>.</p><p>A first quick map allowed to identify the regions heated by the laser, also thanks to previously recorded optical images, as represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Regions of about 20x20 µm 2 were then selected around the hot spot for a fine mapping.</p><p>The beam size of about 0.7x0.7 µm 2 and a step of 2 µm allow to finely probe chemical reactions around the heated spot. All the spectra in the fine map are normalized setting the intensity of the XANES before the edge (point A in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) at 0 and the XANES after the edge (point B) at 1 for all spectra. The derivative of XANES spectra is then calculated and inversed. The prominence of the peak indicated as C in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> will be referred to as "Edge bump prominence", the edge jump previous to the normalization will be referred to as "Edge prominence", and the prominence of the peak indicated as D will be indicated as "Negative Edge Bump Slope". These three parameters can be plotted to identify and localize chemical reactions, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>.</p><p>Once the reaction has been localized, using the protocol developed in [Boccato2020] it is possible to quantify the amount of carbon in the hot spot. This analysis is still ongoing. (a) (b) (c) (d)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the framework of this project, mapping of previosly laser heated Fe-O samples was performed, Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The fine mapping allows to easily localize and identify the hot spots and preform linear combination analysis to determine the composition of the hot spot after heating. This analysis, performed on heated Fe-O at different pressures will allow to better constrain the compositional phase diagram of Fe-O.</p></div>			</div>
