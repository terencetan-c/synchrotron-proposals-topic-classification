<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>What is driving the iron shuttle from coastal shelves to deep basins? </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment has been very successful and was executed, in most respects, as planned. The extra allocated beamtime and the very favourable course of the experiment allowed us to extend the experimental programme and the set of analysed samples. That is, in addition to Fe also XAFS spectra were collected at the Mn K-edge. Furthermore, suspended material from the Baltic Sea, cable bacteria retrieved from different sediments, and resin-embedded sediments were analysed. The latter were collected at the corresponding sites at which also suspended material had been sampled. First results from -XRD measurements of some representative samples demonstrated that the signal from thin sections of resin-imbedded sediments is sufficient to perform -XRD analyses.</p><p>In total 11 filters were analysed. The suspended material had been collected by different methods. Filters contained only small amounts of suspended material when they were obtained by filtration of bottles with water from distinct depths intervals. -XRF results showed the diversity of materials but concentrations of Fe and Mn were usually too low to obtain XAFS spectra of sufficient quality. Filters, which were collected in situ by pumping large quantities of water through a filtration unit, contained sufficient material and were suitable for XAFS analyses. However, the thickness of the material on the filter undermined the advantage of working with a focussed beam. It was possible to distinguish and to identify different Mn containing phases on the filters including different Mn oxides, Mn in silicates, and, at one location in the Black Sea, a Mn sulphide. Most of the analysed Fe-rich spots contained silicate-bound Fe, predominately Fe containing clay minerals (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The omnipresence of clay minerals, however, impeded the unequivocal identification of Fe oxides based on XANES and EXAFS analyses as the quality of the spectra was usually insufficient to separate a small signal from Fe oxides from the overwhelming contribution of silicate-bound Fe.</p><p>The ubiquitous presence of Fe containing silicates also presented a challenge in characterizing small quantities of reactive Fe phases in sediment samples. Presence of Fe sulphides and their identification as pyrite could be established in samples from sulphidic sediments but substantiating the presence of Fe oxides and their detailed characterization remained problematic. However, very interesting results were obtained regarding the characterization of Mn phases in Baltic Sea sediments. The results demonstrate that Mn-oxides, which form in the water column and are buried in the sediment, transform into Mn carbonates. The investigated sediments showed layers of Mn carbonate which witness oxidation events in the Baltic. An unexpected and relevant finding is that these carbonates can react further to form Mn phosphates. This mechanism counteracts the release of phosphate, which is formed in deeper sediment layers, into the overlying waters. The combination of -XRF and -XAS allowed us to demonstrate that, over a depth interval of a few millimetres, several Mn-rich layers are present and differ regarding the presence of Mn phosphates. Presence of Mn carbonates (rhodochrosite) was further confirmed by -XRD. It still needs to be investigated whether the relative abundance of Mn phosphates can be obtained from -XRD mapping. 0.5 1 1.5 2 ormalized (E) biotite 14 10 Black_Sea_filter9_Fe Graph 1 1.5 2 ormalized (E) 6540 6560 6580 6600 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 energy [eV] normalized (E) spessarite 27 28 29 Black_Sea_filter9_Mn Graph 7100 7120 7140 7160 7180 7200 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 energy [eV] normalized (E) biotite 14 10 Black_Sea_filter9_Fe Graph 7100 7120 7140 7160 7180 7200 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 energy [eV] normalized (E) illite 18 22 7100 7120 7140 7160 7180 7200 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 energy 1182_biotite_FeSi2 biotite Illite_gray_shale_fithian_reduced_Tr_merge_3897_3898 14 18 22 26 Black_Sea_filter9_Fe Graph</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Wout de Nolf and Ana Pradas del Real Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Caroline Slomp * , Utrecht University (NL), Fac.
