<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The preliminary work plan was modified during our stay at ESRF. It appeared in the litterature the single x-ray crystal structure of CaV205 which gave less interest to look at this compound. However we took the opportunity to use a heating system to study in dynamic the structural transformation of 6 LiV205 into E LiV205 and then into y LiV205 with the increase of temperature. This work was very successful and a publication was submitted in january in the Journal of Solid State Chemistry. The main results are summarized in the following abstract:</p><p>The structural evolution and the domains stability of the 6, E, y phases of the lithium vanadium oxde bronze LiV205 has been evidenced by synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction in the temperature range 100 -250째C. It is shown that 6 LiV205 is stable below 120째C and that complete transformation in the high temperature form y LiV205 is achieved above 220째C. The crystal structure of the intermediate phase E LiV205 has been determined by Rietveld analysis. It crystallises in the orthorhombic system space group P2lmn and the cell parameters at 140째C are a=11.3552(6)1$, b=3.5732(2)A and c=4.6548(3)&amp; The electronic localisation of the vanadium atoms over two different crystallographic sites is found for this phase as for another bronze a' NaV205.</p><p>The temperature evolution of the x-ray powder patterns of 6 LiV205 on heating are presented on this figure.</p><p>(001) E</p><p>Concerning the compounds Bi4V4014, Bi4V8022 and MgV205, x-ray powder patterns were collected but they are still to be analysed in view of the recent results obtained in September 97 at the ILL. For MgV205 additionnal peaks (small satellites) are present which could indicate the presence of a superstructure.</p><p>In the case of the incommensurate phase Pb2CdWO6 satellite peaks were clearly identified during this experiment as shown on the following figure.</p></div>		</body>
