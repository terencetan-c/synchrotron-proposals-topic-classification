<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Nanoscale carbonate-oxalate mineralogy from the Great Barrier Reef: understanding pollution and climate change impacts during coral and sediment formation Please note: EV-449 was undertaken in two parts as described above.</p><p>Parts 1 and 2: Dr. Stuart Mills, Museums Victoria Owen Missen, Monash University (co-affiliated with Museums Victoria) Part 2 only: Prof. Joël Brugger &amp; Dr. Barbara Etschmann, Monash University</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aim</head><p>To study the correlation between the mineralogical, geochemical and microbial characteristics of sediments and (mineralised) corals from the Low Isles reef near Port Douglas, in the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. We aim to characterise the interfaces between different calcium carbonate and oxalate minerals and also analyse trace element signatures in the corals, particularly phosphorus and potassium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Our experiment encompassed the measurement of standards of calcium (Ca) carbonates and oxalates (calcite, aragonite and whewellite in different crystallographic orientations) to then correlate these standards with the mineralogical compositions of the corals.</p><p>Calcium was analysed at the K-edge (4038 eV) for X-ray absorption spectrscopy (XAS), and all elements from magnesium to calcium were analysed in the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) maps. The samples benefited from the use of high energy XAS for analysis of trace elements. Linear combination fitting of processed data has been employed to analyse the mineralogical composition of the corals.</p><p>Our thanks to beamline scientists Eduardo and Hiram for their tireless efforts to do all on-site tasks as this was a remote beamtime due to the pandemic. Without them a successful beamtime would have been impossible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Observations</head><p> Calcium carbonates undergo transformations to calcium oxalates in mineralised corals.  Differences between phosphorus and potassium hot-spots from bleached and non-bleached corals shows that contamination from fertilizer run-off from land-based agriculture results in changes to the trace element signatures in coral.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impact</head><p>This study is one of the first to use a minerlogical lens to analyse transformations in the corals of the Great Barrier Reef. Most studies use ecological or climatic indicators only.</p><p>We submitted an abstract to the GeoMinKöln conference 2022: Villalobos Portillo, E.E., Missen, O.P., Castillo Michel, H. &amp; Mills, S.J. Great Barrier Reef nanoscale carbonate-oxalate mineralogy: pollution and climate change impacts on the coral reef ecosystem.</p><p>We intend to publish the results from this experiment following further data analysis and incorporation of additional mineralogical and potentially climatic information, linking mineralogy with the direct impacts of changing climate on corals.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>

Phosphorus shows streaking (blue lines, perhaps cavities in the coral filled by P-rich fluids) while the potassium (green) forms hot-spots separate from the calcium. The porous structure of the coral is shown by the varying distribution intensiyu of calcium (red).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,141.50,202.44,317.97,157.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Mineralised Low Isles Coral samples LICo4 nd LICo6 fall between the standard spectra of pure carbonate and oxalate spectra, with LICo4 having mainly oxalate character, and LICo6 carbonate character.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,92.65,431.40,415.55,304.30" type="bitmap" /></figure>
