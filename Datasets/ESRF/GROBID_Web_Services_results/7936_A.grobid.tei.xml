<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We were originally scheduled single-bunch mode in order to test beam focusing at ID30. The flux was therefore significantly lower than normally required for high-pressure DAC experiments above 50 GPa. The original intention in 11/96 was to run monochromatic. Problems in mirror operation after lengthy set up prevented these experiments going ahead as planned. We were able, due to rapid response of BL staff, to run in energy-dispersive mode and succeeded in obtaining data on AlHs and AIDs to up to 50 GPa. We confirmed two objectives: (1) Repeat of AlDs in excess He to correct for (apparently) sensitive dependence of the EOS obtained in a previous study to onset of nonhydrostatic conditions and (2) compression of AIHs in a solid Hz medium to verify no additional exchange or deviation of atomic H in metal Al host with pressure. We obtained a constant resolvable difference in volume between the two isotopes as a function of pressure and accurate measurements of the H volume.</p><p>Due to the earlier beam problems, we returned in 3/97 to continue experiments in monochromatic mode. We obtained pressures above 100 GPa on the Ni (Fig. <ref type="figure">l</ref>), Fe, and Re -H (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) systems and high resolution data on low symmetry Fe&amp; to 50 GPa under hydrostatic conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Beam size had been measured at ESRF before arrival at &lt;O.OlO mm. We found that strongly interfering diffraction was obtained from the gasket confining the sample. Nonetheless, early results were sufficient to provide some indication of the pressure dependence of the H atom volume in metals under pressure: Ni appears in accord with a d-band electronic model, but Re does not. Further work on d metals from other Groups in the periodic table will help understand these effects.</p><p>smarimsn, rermrt fmm. *uK".t ,006 wmx "Edon 1.0,</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It appears that the technique to focus and/or measure monochromatic beam sizes in the 0.010 mm range are not yet effective at ESRF. Unlike single-crystal techniques, it is essential in powder studies of low-2 systems to exclude gasket diffraction as intensities from the sample are significantly lower. Further, there is a distinction here between use of a gasket as the sample itself (as has been reported at ESRF (ID9)) and the more stringent use of a gasket to confine a different sample which means that all extraneous diffraction must be excluded. In focusing geometry, beam collimation (a useful solution in white-beam ED experiments), may or may to be effective if the aperture is not located close to the sample and is usually prevented by the geometry of the DAC. We plan continuation of proposals as technical developments and solutions resulting from these experiments take place at ESRF. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Equation of sate of Nii. and Ni.
