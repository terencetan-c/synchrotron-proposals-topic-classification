<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Since only 9 among the 18 requested shifts were accorded for the experiment, our measurement strategy was reviewed accordingly. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were then performed at both the As-K edge (11867 eV) and at the Tl L3 edge (12658 eV) at the LISA beamline (BM-08, d'Acapito et al.,  2016)  at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble -France). Spectra were acquired in the energy range 11667-12850 eV for As and 12458-13206 eV for Tl. In order to reduce the thermal damping of the signal and to prevent possible beam-induced redox reactions, all samples were measured in vacuum at 80 K. Spectra were collected in both fluorescence and transmission mode.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Studied samples were: i) three natural pyrite samples from ores of the southern Apuan Alps; all pyrite samples were measured at the As K-edge and one of them at both As K-and at Tl L3-edge, ii) one limonite sample, originated from the alteration of pyrite deposits, measured at both As K and at Tl L3 edge, iii) seven standards of As bearing minerals measured at the As K-edge only: skutterudite (CoAs3), protochabournéite (As 3+ sulfide), arsenopyrite (FeAsS), adamite (Zn2AsO4OH), orpiment (As2S3), As2O3, As2O5 (hydrated).</p><p>Samples of set i) and ii) were measured in fluorescence mode by means of a 12-elements solid state (high purity Germanium) detector. Suitable filters were used for fluorescence measurements in order to attenuate for Fe fluorescence emission. For measurements at the Tl L3 edge, given the presence of the As fluorescence emission (Kα1 = 10543 eV) which almost superimposes on Tl emission line (Lα1 = 10269 eV), spectra were then collected with a Ga filter (K-edge = 10367 eV) associated with a 40 μm Al filter. The Ga filter was prepared in the laboratories of the "Dipartimento di Scienze della Terra, Università di Pisa" by deposing Ga2O3 on various layers of teflon filters to obtain a thickness equivalent to 80 μm of Ga2O3 which should absorb ~ 80% of fluorescence emission above Ga K-edge. A minimum of ten spectra was collected for each sample. Samples of set iii) were measured in transmission mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tl L3 edge results</head><p>The XANES spectrum of the pyrite sample (CDR6) indicates that Tl in pyrite is present as Tl(I), showing a single absorption peak, typical of Tl monovalent compounds (e.g. In all the pyrite samples Tl-S distance is typical of Tl with low coordination number (CN), as testified by the comparison with protochabournéite where Tl is present in two sites, bonding 9 S atoms with an average Tl-S distance of ~3.39 Å. The limonite sample resembles those measured in rust scales from water pipes in exp. 08-01-1016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Biagioni et al., 2017)</ref>; despite the high noise prevents us from doing a more accurate analysis, it is possible to say that also in this case Tl is bonded to O with a distance of 2.26(5) Å, typical of Tl(III) in 6-fold coordination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>As K-edge results</head><p>Measurements at the As K-edge were, as suggested by the review panel, focused on the XANES region.</p><p>Preliminary results show that in all the sample there is a high variability in As speciation. Despite the measurements were taken in vacuum, there was no way to avoid the partial oxidation of As into As 5+ in sample FOR. It is reasonable to think indeed that all the "arsenate" contributions in pyrite highlighted by the LCF are due to the oxidation of As during the preparation of the pellets. However, since As is always present as both As -and As 3+ , collected data confirm that the hypothesis of a substitution mechanism such Tl + + As 3+ = 2Fe 2+ , the main aim of the experiment, could be possible in the studied systems.</p><p>As for the limonite sample, it was possible to notice that As is present only as As(V) and bonded to oxygen. Indeed both the edge position and EXAFS results (As-O=1.70 Å) are compatible with the presence of As as arsenate.</p><p>All the assigned shifts were used during the experiment and it was possible to collect a large amount of data. The Tl signal results however extremely attenuated, with the XAS signal dominated by the background (due to the emission of Fe and As).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>EXAFS fit results (see Table1, together with pyrite samples measured in exp. 08-01-1016) indicate that Tl has a first coordination shell constituted by S atoms with an average Tl-S distance of 3.19(3) Å.EXAFS fit results on pyrite </figDesc><table><row><cell>Path CN</cell><cell>R(Å)</cell><cell>σ 2 (Å 2 )</cell></row><row><cell>SEN</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Tl-S 3(1)</cell><cell cols="2">3.12(5) 0.02(1)</cell></row><row><cell>FOR5</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="3">Tl-S 2.0(3) 2.97(5) 0.012(2)</cell></row><row><cell>CDR6</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Tl-S 6(1)</cell><cell cols="2">3.19(3) 0.037(6)</cell></row><row><cell>Protochabournéite</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Tl-S 6(1)</cell><cell cols="2">3.25(2) 0.014(1)</cell></row><row><cell>Tl-S 3(1)</cell><cell>3.50(2)</cell><cell>//</cell></row><row><cell>R is the path length, σ=Debye-Waller factor.</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row></table><note><p>Biagioni et al., 2017 and references therein);</p></note></figure>
