<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Laue case diffractive -refractive optics: first experimental test</p><p>Experiment number: MI751 Beamline BM05 Date of experiment: from: 4 November 2005 to: 7 November 2005 Date of report: 24 January 2006 Shifts: 9 Local contact(s): Dr. Luca Peverini Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Jaromir Hrdy* Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Vito Mocella* CNR IMM Peter Oberta* Institute of Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic Luca Peverini* ESRF Kirill Potlovskiy* Russian Research Centre Kurchatov Institute Report:</p><p>The possibility of the sagittal focusing of synchrotron radiation by an asymmetric Laue crystal with profiled surfaces was experimentally demonstrated for the first time. The sample was Si single crystal with two parallel holes of the diameter of 8 mm. The axes of the holes formed the angle of 7.95 0 with (111) diffracting planes and were arranged vertically with respect to the diffracting planes. The 15.35 keV synchrotron radiation was diffracted in the space between the holes. The minimum thickness of this Laue crystal was 0.5 mm. The diffracted beam formed the angle 0.55 0 with the exit surface. The experiment was performed at BM05 beamline in ESRF. The length of the beamline was not sufficiently long to detect the focus but the experiment clearly showed that the diffracted beam was sagittally convergent. The images of the diffracted beam taken just after the crystal (a) and at the distance of 20 m from the crystal (b) are shown in Fig. 2.</p><p>It was suggested, that the aberrations seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> (sagittal and meridional spread of the diffracted beam) may be removed by using dispersive setting of two Laue crystals with profiled surfaces as it is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.
