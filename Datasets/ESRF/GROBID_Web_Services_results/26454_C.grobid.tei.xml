Funke* 1: Institut für Metallphysik, Montanuniversität Leoben, Austria Report:</p><p>Nanoclusters -near monodispersed metal particles that are generally less than 10 nm (100Å) in diameter-have attracted intense over the past decade. On reason of this is the belief that nanoclusters will have unique properties, derived in part from the fact that these particles and their properties lie somewhere between those of the bulk and single-particle species. These strange "morsels of matter" have fascinating potential uses; nanoclusters have significant potential especially for catalysis as new types of high activity and selectivity catalysts.Palladium metal is one of the most promising catalysts. It has been used for removing nitrate ion from drinking water, hydrogenation and for combustion reactions. In this work the formation of Pd nanoclusters by the cells and S-layers of B. sphaericus JG-A12 and 9602 in anaerobic conditions are studied using EXAFS spectroscopy.</p><p>Pd K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were collected at low temperature in fluorescence mode at the Rossendorf Beamline (ROBL) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble (France) using the Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. The energy was calibrated by measuring the Pd K-edge transmission spectrum of a palladium foil and defining the first inflection point as 24350 eV. Eight spectra for each sample were recorded. The EXAFS oscillations were isolated from the raw, averaged data by removal of the pre-edge background, approximated by a first-order polynomial, followed by 0 -removal via spline fitting techniques and normalization using a Victoreen function. Deadtime correction was applied. The EXAFS spectra were analyzed according to the standard procedures using the program EXAFSPAK. The theoretical scattering phase and amplitude functions used in data analysis were calculated using FEFF8.</p><p>Throughout this section, FT peak distances are reported in units of Å, uncorrected for phase shift (i.e., R + ¡ ¢£¤ ¥¦ §¨¦©© ¦ ¦ ©¨¦ ¨¦ ©¨!

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Interaction of palladium with cells of B. sphaericus JG-A12</head><p>The FT of the EXAFS spectra of the palladium clusters formed by the cells of B. sphaericus JG-A12 in presence of H 2 (reducing agent) at pH 2 and 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) are similar and presented 4 peaks. Using Pd-Pd phase and amplitude functions form a palladium foil, these FT give distance of 2.75, 3.88, 4.77 and 5.42 ± 0.02 Å. These results confirmed the formation of palladium nanoclusters by the cells of the mentioned bacterium at pH 2 and 4 in the presence of H 2 . However in the absence of reducing agent (H 2 ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>) the FT of the EXAFS spectra are completely different from those obtained in the presence of H 2 . The preliminary fit of the first 2 main shells using the Pd-O amplitude and phase functions giving a distances of 1.98 and 2.45 ± 0.02 Å. The third FT peak was modeled to a Pd-Pd contribution giving a distance of 3.06 ± 0.02 Å which is in good agreement with the Pd-Pd distance in PdO (R=3.03 ± 0.02 Å).</p></div>

Interaction of palladium with S-layer of B. sphaericus JG-A12 and 9602</head><p>In these 2 samples, the first peak was modelled to a contribution of a oxygen backscatter at a distance of 1.98 ± 0.02 Å which is in good agreement with the Pd-O1 distance in PdO (R=2.018 ± 0.02 Å). The 2 and 3 peaks are arising from contribution of palladium backscatter giving distances of 2.74 and 4.78 ± 0.02 Å.</p></div>
