<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Zinc sulfide (ZnS) may dominate the Zn speciation in several types of OWs. However, only a few studies have identified this species, notably due to sampling, storage and analytical shortcomings. Direct observation of ZnS (in the form of nano-sized particles) is as recent as 2014 in sewage sludge<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> and 2016 in pig slurry<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> . There is little information on their fate in the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples Analyzed</head><p>We used XAS to analyze the speciation and molecular environment of Zn in well-preserved OWs as well as in soils following OW amendments in three controlled, field-scale, long-term experiments, according to the table below:</p><p>Field experiment Type of soil Type of organic waste applied Experiment duration #1 (Santa Maria, RS, Brazil) Sandy loam Pig slurry 2000-2008 #2 (Ponta Grossa, PR, Brazil) Clay loam Dairy manure 2005-2014 #3 (Castro, PR, Brazil) Clayey Dairy manure 2005-2014</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The concentration of Zn in the control soils, i.e., the soils containing only natural Zn levels, was rather low: 23.7 mg/kg in field #1 (Santa Maria), 24.1 mg/kg in field #2 (Ponta Grossa), and 46.3 mg/kg in field #3 (Castro).</p><p>Because of increasing noise at high k values, only an extended XANES was recorded for the control soils of fields #1 and #2. For the soils amended with organic waste and for the organic wastes itself (higher Zn concentrations), we could record good quality EXAFS up to high k values.</p><p>The figure below summarizes the EXAFS recorded for the samples from fields #1 and #3, together with the results of the LCF procedure conducted to elucidate the Zn speciation in each case. In both field experiments, ZnS dominated the Zn speciation in the organic wastes applied: 100% ZnS in the pig slurry applied to field #1 and 76% ZnS in the dairy manure applied to field #3. This confirmed the hypothesis that ZnS might be a dominant species in these types of wastes, though this has been overlooked due to little attention during sample collection and preservation.</p><p>The fate of organic waste borne ZnS was very similar in both field experiments, despite the soils featuring different textures and different mineralogy. Zn-kaolinite and Zn-Fe(hydr)oxide accounted for about 50% each of the Zn speciation in the natural soils (no organic waste amendments). In the soils amended with pig slurry or dairy manure, the proportion of Zn-Fe(hydr)oxide increased considerably, indicating that these are the species responsible for the Zn uptake in the amended soils.</p><p>Noteworthy, ZnS was not detected in the amended soils, despite the increase in Zn concentration caused by the organic waste amendments. This is rather surprising due to the expected low solubility of these species. The occurrence of ZnS as nano-sized particles has been proposed as an explanation for its high instability in the soil.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publications</head><p>Given the relevance and originality of the results, we will complement our dataset by investigating other field experiments, where other types of soils and organic wastes are also considered. The final goal is to understand to which extent the soil features and/or the speciation of Zn in the source control the long-term environmental fate of Zn in agroecosystems. This was partially accomplished during experiment A30-2 1146 and will be finalized in a new experiment for which beamtime is being requested. A manuscript with comprehensive data and discussion should be submitted for publication soon.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="2,34.00,243.83,499.02,158.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
