<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This project focuses on understanding the most significant geochemical differentiation process occuring early on Earth: the segregation of the core from the bulk silicate Earth during the so called magma ocean stage. In this context, chemical elements are distributed between metal (core) and silicate (mantle) according to their affinity for metallic phases defined as the siderophility of elements. Some siderophile elements can also be volatile elements (i.e. low condensation temperature) and their depletions in the bulk silicate Earth with respect to solar composition <ref type="bibr">(Wood et al., 2006)</ref> can be accordingly explained either through partitioning into metal phases or by volatilisation. Furthermore, the observed distribution of certain elements on Earth are assumed to be produced by the late delivery of extraterrestrial material after core formation ceased <ref type="bibr">(Righter et al., 2017)</ref>, the so-called 'late veneer' hypothesis. Sulfur (S), selenium (Se), and tellurium (Te), are siderophile and volatile elements which share similar condensation temperature (~700 K) and depletions in silicate Earth. The experimental study of the partitioning of these elements between metal and silicate can accordingly be used to decipher in between an early arrival of volatile elements on Earth, which abundances would be affected by core formation, or a late arrival from late accretion only.</p><p>In this research, we aim to determine for the first time the partitioning of Se, Te and S between metal and silicate phases at direct pressure and temperature of Earth's core formation (P &gt;40 GPa, T &gt;3000 K). By performing laser-heating diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) experiments, we equilibrated at extreme P-T conditions metal carrying Se, Te and S with a silicate of peridotitic composition, similar to the primitive magma ocean. The twelve DAC samples, and one glassy standard (synthesised using a piston-cylinder apparatus) were prepared for analyses in FIB thick sections between 2 and 4 μm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). X-ray Fluorescence at the ID16B beamline offers both the analytical and spatial resolution to measure trace abundances of Se and Te (few tens ppm) in the small quenched silicate phase (&lt; few microns) of the DAC samples which are well below the detection limits and spatial resolution achievable with traditional analytical techniques (e.g. electron probe microanalyses). The Xray Fluorescence maps performed during the 15 shifts at the beamline ID16B seem promising thanks to the help of the local contact present at ESRF, Valentina Bonino, despite we faced unpredictible issues such as electric storms or server connection failures for which the data collection was interrupted, or troubles with the holder glue, which unsticked during some long measurements. Consequently, fewer maps than expected were collected.</p><p>The nanoXRF maps were performed mostly at high resolution (100 nm) with long exposure time (500 ms) for acquisition of good quality data. In the analysed run products, we collected quantitative XRF maps for Se and Te encompassing regions at the interface in between metal and silicate phases. In order to quantify the elemental concentration on melts, we define Regions Of Interest (ROIs) which are analysed by using the software PyMCA, developed at ESRF <ref type="bibr">(Solé et al., 2007)</ref>. With these measurements, we demonstrated that the low concentrations of Se and Te in the silicate phases can be detected. This will allow us to constrain for the first time the partitioning of these elements at direct conditions of Earth's core formation in a deep magma ocean.</p><p>Finally, we can argue that the beamtime was very productive even though the issues hampered measurements on critical samples as well. We expect to retrieve further data from the XRF maps in the upcoming days in order to determine whether the observed abundance of Se and Te in the silicate Earth should be explained through core equilibration processes or if they were delivered in a later stage. Due to technical issues on the beamline, we could not perform the measurements on all our samples and additional beamtime will be requested to finalize this study.
