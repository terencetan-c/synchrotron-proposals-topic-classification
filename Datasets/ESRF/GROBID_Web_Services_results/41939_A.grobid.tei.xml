<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The EXAFS spectra were collected at Mo K-edge (20 000 eV) and Co K-edge edge (7 709 eV) in transmission mode. The X-ray beam was monochromatized using Si(111) double crystal monochromator.</p><p>The acquisition time for EXAFS spectra was 40 min. The XRD data were collected using a wavelength of 1.64 Å. The acquisition time for diffraction pattern was 2 min. The EXAFS spectra and XRD data were collected sequently. The typical cycle of collection EXAFS/XRD data lasted between 42-44 min.</p><p>The measured samples were in the form of powder pressed into 13 mm pellets. The pellets were mounted on the holder placed inside the furnace. During experiments samples were heated in the furnace using kanthal wire from room temperature to 400 0 C at rate of 5 0 C/min and then up to 550 0 C at rate of 2.5 0 C/min. The Pt-Rh thermocouple was used to measure temperature on the samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The prelimenary results</head><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) are shown XRD patterns of as-synthesised cobalt molybdate collected during heating from room temperature to 550 0 C. Diffraction pattern obtained at room temperature contains only two reflections. These reflections do not undergo any changes up to temperature of 250 0 C. Increasing the temperature to 360 0 C, the β-isomorph peak appears at 28 0 . This peak remains at the same position during heating up to 550 0 C. Diffraction pattern of CoMoO 4 acquired at 550 0 C corresponds to β-phase of CoMoO 4 . Normalized EXAFS spectra collected at Co K-edge are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>) obtained from combined XAS/XRD measurements. Considering the XANES region of the XAS spectra, we can extract information about geometric characteristics of cobalt molybdate. The Co 2+ ions in CoMoO 4 occupy sites with octahedral coordination, since we don't observe changes during transformation to β-phase. Moreover, we also followed phase transformation of as-prepared CoMoO 4 to β-phase at Mo K-edge in order to find out coordination of Mo 6+ ions in this catalyst. More detailed data analysis are in progress to quantitatively determine the state of cobalt and molybdenum sites. The EXAFS spectra of CoMoO 4 collected at Mo K-edge is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>.  Conclusion Employing combined in situ XAS/XRD measurements enabled us to follow structural transformation in the model system CoMoO 4 and CoMoO 4 -H 2 O which took place during heating at elevated temperatures. Collecting data at Co K-edge and Mo K-edge allowed us to obtain information on changes in coordination around Co 2+ and Mo 6+ in these catalysts during transformation. The XRD was used to identify phases present during heat treatment process. a b b</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Sankar*, University College London, Dep. of Chemistry, London, UK Martin Martis* University College London, Dep. of Chemistry, London, UK</figDesc></figure>
