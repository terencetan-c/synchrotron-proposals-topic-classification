<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>As detailed in the proposal (please see proposal reference number:45185, final number MX-1226) the principal aims of the work were to: 1.</p><p>Determine the solution structure of V. cholerae and E. coli Hfq.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Determine the solution structure of V. cholerae and E. coli sRNAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.</head><p>Identify any structural changes that occur upon sRNA-Hfq complex formation. During a previous experiment (MX-1102), aim 1 was successfully completed. Please see MX-1102 final report for further information. During experiment MX-1226 steps have been taken to collect data for aims 2 and 3 with initial successful progress being achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>SAXS data for each test E. coli and V. cholerae sRNA has been collected. In each case, the data suggest the sRNAs to be monomeric. The data collected for the V. cholerae Qrr sRNAs identified them to be very similar in structure. Specifically, Qrr1 sRNA has an R g of 40 Å and D max of 220 Å, Qrr2 has an R g of 51 Å and D max of 223 Å, Qrr3 has an R g of 54 Å and D max of 300 Å, and Qrr4 has an R g of 54 Å and D max of 330 Å (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Ab initio modelling indicates each Qrr sRNA has an extended structure (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>inset).</head><p>The data collected for the E. coli sRNAs under investigation gave similar results to those obtained for the V. cholerae sRNAs. Ab initio modelling of the SAXS data for the E. coli sRNAs similarly indicated them to form extended structures. Collectively, these data for V. cholerae and E. coli sRNAs represent the first solution structures of sRNAs to our knowledge and demonstrate significant progress within aim 2 of our study.</p><p>SAXS data for an sRNA-Hfq complex from E. coli and a complex from V. cholerae were collected to complement SANS analysis conducted in collaboration with Dr Phil Collow (ILL). For the E. coli sRNA-Hfq complex, collection of SAXS data for the complex in 0%, 40%, 73% and 100% D 2 O demonstrated no significant aggregation to be present such that would prevent further analysis. This was very important information for the complementary SANS analysis of the same samples. SAXS analysis of the E. coli sRNA-Hfq complex at the various D 2 O concentrations identified the complex to have an R g of ~56 Å and D max of ~225 Å. Ab initio modelling suggests the complex to have a structure capable of encompassing one Hfq hexamer and one sRNA monomer (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This is in agreement with our data on complex formation stoichiometries obtained using size exclusion chromatography, nondissociating mass spectrometry and electrophoretic mobility shift assays which all identified a 1:1 sRNA-Hfq complex. The SAXS data are also in keeping with the current results from SANS analysis of the complex at 0% and 100% D 2 O; the D 2 O concentrations at which the complete complex can be visualised. SANS analysis of the 40% and 73% D 2 O concentrations will allow it to be possible to specifically identify the RNA and protein solution structures respectively within the complex and thereby refine the model of the E. coli sRNA-Hfq complex. This analysis is currently ongoing. SAXS analysis of the V. cholerae sRNA-Hfq complex at the various D 2 O concentrations of 0%, 40%, 73% and 100% required for complementary SANS analysis gave similar results to those obtained for the E. coli sRNA-Hfq complex. Importantly, no significant aggregation was identified to be present in the various D 2 O samples such that further analysis would be prevented. SAXS analysis of the V. cholerae sRNA-Hfq complex identified an R g of ~49 Å and D max of ~180 Å and ab initio modelling similarly indicated the complex to have a structure capable of encompassing one Hfq hexamer and one sRNA monomer. Initial indications are that, as expected, the SAXS data are in keeping with the results from SANS analysis of the complex at 0% and 100% D 2 O. Ongoing SANS analysis of the 40% and 73% D 2 O concentrations will allow it to be possible to specifically identify the RNA and protein solution structures respectively within the complex and thereby refine the model of the V. cholerae sRNA-Hfq complex.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary</head><p>The steps taken in analysing the sRNAs alone and in complex with Hfq (aims 2 and 3) are significant and are providing the first solution structure information on sRNAs and sRNA-Hfq complexes. The preparation of the sRNAs and sRNA-Hfq complexes can be challenging and demonstration of the suitability of these samples for SAXS and SANS analysis is important in guiding future sample preparations for continuing analysis. With this knowledge in hand, and confidence in our ability to prepare samples of appropriate quality and analyse successfully the data obtained, we hope that future SAXS and SANS experiments will allow this work to be completed in full.  .
