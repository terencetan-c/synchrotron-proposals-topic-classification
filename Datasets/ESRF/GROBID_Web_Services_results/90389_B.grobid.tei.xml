<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary:</head><p>High-pressure/temperature smithsonite (ZnCO3) solubility experiments in pure water and saline solutions [1 m NaCl(aq) and in 4.5 m NaCl(aq)] were carried out at the X-ray absorption beamline BM23. Smithsonite crystals of known volume (~20 x 20 x 20 μm) were loaded in the sample chamber of the diamond anvil cell (DAC) together with the aqueous fluid. The DAC was then pressurised and heated. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra of the fluid were collected at different pressure/temperature steps in order to monitor the solubility of smithsonite, which increased with increasing pressure-temperature conditions. In addition, XRF spectra of ZnCl2(aq) reference solutions loaded in the DAC were collected at ambient temperature. A high-pressure hightemperature experiment investigating potential Re dissolution in the fluid was also run. The concentration of Re in the fluid remained constant at different pressure-temperature conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DAC:</head><p>Two membrane-type DACs <ref type="bibr">(Letoullec et al. 1988</ref>) from ID27, equipped with type Ia single crystal diamond anvils with culet diameters of 500 μm were used. A partially perforated diamond anvil with a remaining thickness of ~150 um facing the XRF detector was employed to minimize the absorption of the fluorescence signal from the diamond. Rhenium gaskets were employed, pre-indented from an initial thickness of 200 μm to ~80 μm, then laser drilled with a 200 μm diameter hole, and lined with a 25 μm gold layer to prevent Re dissolution in the high P-T fluid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Heating and temperature determination:</head><p>The DAC was heated resistively using an external heating device, in which the DAC and its heater were enclosed in a vacuum chamber equipped with Mylar windows that permit transmission of X-rays. A high vacuum of up to 10 -6 bars ensured a homogenous heating during the long duration of the experiments and prevents the oxidation of the diamonds and heater. The setup further allows for a fine and remote control of the pressure and temperature <ref type="bibr">(Dewaele et al. 2018)</ref>. For the latter, a K-type thermocouple is positioned close to the heater. A second thermocouple was placed in contact with one of the diamonds to monitor the sample temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pressure determination:</head><p>Pressure was monitored based on the diffraction signal of gold and the thermal equation of state reported by <ref type="bibr">Fei et al. (2007)</ref>. The incident X-ray beam energy for X-ray diffraction (XRD) was 15 keV. Diffraction data were recorded using a 165 mm diameter MarCCD XRD detector positioned on the downstream side of the DAC. A CeO2 standard was used to calibrate the distance, detector tilt, and rotation parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XRF:</head><p>The incident X-ray beam energy for XRF was E0= 11.0 keV (λ=1.1271 Å). The XRF signal was collected using a HITACHI Vortex Si drift diode detector with a 40 mm 2 active area and a sensitive layer thickness of 1 mm equipped with XOS polycapillary focusing optics, which allows the extraction of emitted fluorescence signal from a small sample area of 50×50 (h×w) µm 2 .</p><p>The experimental setup at BM23</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>Thanks to the exceptional experimental setup at BM23, solubility data could be collected up to 6 GPa and 400 °C. The solubility of smithsonite was found to increase with salinity, pressure, and temperature in the studied pressure range. The detailed experimental results can be found in the following publication: </p></div>
