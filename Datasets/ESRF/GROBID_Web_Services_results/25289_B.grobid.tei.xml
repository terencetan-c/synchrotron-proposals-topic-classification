<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">GIXD studies of the structure of ultrathin polydiacetylene films at the air-water interface.</head><p>The first experiments in HS-2035 were devoted to the study of the structure of the linear ultrathin polydiacetylene substrate at the air-water interface. 10,12 Pentacosadiynoic acid molecules were spread on water, compressed to a trilayer structure and exposed to UV radiation. After the topochemical polymerization the GIXD measurement showed the following pattern as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> summarizes the data in real and reciprocal space. The Bragg rod intensities as a function of q z are plotted separately in Figs. <ref type="figure">1(b-d</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. (a) Diffraction intensity map of q z vs. q xy obtained in a GIXD experiment from PDA trilayer on airwater interface. (b-d) Bragg rods for the three observed peaks: (b) Bragg rod at 1.383 A -1 (#1).

A good agreement was obtained between our GIXD data and the reported ED results.</p><p>Note that the 4.9A is the theoretical distance for the conjugated system in the backbone direction, as expected for this material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">GIXD studies of polydiacetylene films with various divalent metal cations present in subphase.</head><p>While the basic structure of the 2D PDA crystals remained essentially the same, pronounced effects of the subphase composition were nevertheless observed as a function of the cations present in solution. A gradual shift of the (10) Bragg peak to smaller q xy values is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. The tendency is consistent with the radii of the cations present in the subphase (H + &lt;Zn 2+ &lt;Cd 2+ &lt;Pb 2+ ). This confirms that, as expected, the PDA film is strongly interacting with the cations in the subphase. Moreover, the PDA structure is clearly affected by the cations in the subphase, providing a unique and potentially technologically useful "self-adjusting" property of the PDA films as templates for epitaxy of the corresponding nanocrystalline semiconductors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">GIXD studies of CdS nanoparticles directly deposited on polydiacetylene films at the airwater interface</head><p>Direct deposition of CdS nanoparticles on PDA at the air-solution interface was carried out in experiment SI-785 and was repeated as a reference for the current series of experiments. The results turned out to be highly reproducible and all conclusions from SI-785 were reconfirmed in the reference measurement.  </p></div>

These results are supported by high resolution TEM (HRTEM) results that confirmed the coexistence of these orientations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>).
