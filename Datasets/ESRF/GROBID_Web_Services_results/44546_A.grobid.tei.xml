<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experiment title: Determination of the quarternary structure of key proteins involved in Plasmodium falciparum pathogenesis Experiment number: MX1073 Beamline: ID14-3 Date of experiment: from: 26/10/2009 09:30 to: 27/10/2009 08:00 Date of report: Shifts: 3 Local contact(s): Mats ÈŒkvist Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Stig Christoffersen, University of Copenhagen Annette Langkilde, University of Copenhagen Sine Larsen, University of Copenhagen Majbritt Thymark, University of Copenhagen</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to use Small Angle X-ray Scattering to determine the overall structure of two proteins belonging to the family of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane proteins 1 (PfEMP1). The PFEMP1 proteins are expressed on the surface of the infected erythrocytes (IE) and serve as adhesion ligands that interact with a range of host cell receptors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed:</head><p>It was the experimentalists first SAXS experiment at ID14-3, so the experiment also served as an introduction to the beamline, which was given in an excellent way by the local contact and one of the beamline responsibles Adam Round. Unfortunately the beamline was slightly misaligned, so time was spent to get it working optimally. Much time was spent on the BSA standard measurements as we made the mistake to initially use our own less pure Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and not the one provided by the ESRF. A lysozyme standard was also measured.</p><p>The protein that we managed to investigate in greatest detail is the PfEMP1 protein VAR2 that has been shown to be connected to pregnancy-associated malaria. The 310 kDa VAR2 protein is selectively transcribed in all placental parasites investigated to day. Its action is believed to be through binding to the placental receptor chondroitin sulphate A (CSA). SAXS measurements were performed for three different concentrations of VAR2.</p><p>It is through the interaction with placental CSA that VAR2 exerts its action. Measurements were therefore also carried out for CSA and VAR2 in the presence of CSA. It was also attempted to perform experiments on VAR2 labelled with the socalled nanogold, a 1.4 nm gold particle engineered to bind and localize histidine tagged proteins. Attempts adding the nanogold particlesolution to VAR2 protein solutions sadly resulted in precipitation of VAR2.</p><p>Measurements were also performed for VAR3 without its N-terminal domain (molecular mass 7kDa), which is one of the smallest PfEMP1 proteins. The molecular mass of VAR3 is around 80 kDa. Time was spent finding the right concentration range for the SAXS measurements of VAR3. Those performed at the initial higher concentrations showed clear signs of aggregation. Going to lower concentrations a series of measurements were succesfully conducted. Three concentrations of VAR3 was measured, as well as VAR3 in the presence of Nano-gold.</p><p>Unfortunately we did not notice that a misalignment of the beamline had occurred at the end of the 2 nd shift just after our first meassurements on VAR2. This had an unfortunate impact on the subsequent measurements containing fewer counts and hence more noise. As a result the initial measurements on VAR2 were found to represent the most succesful results from this experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results obtained:</head><p>The measurements for VAR2 at different concentrations show the same overall shape for VAR2. However the molecular mass estimated by the SAXS measurement is almost twice its actual molecular mass. We are currently analyzing these data, but as there are problems with polydispersity effort has been put to improve the sample quality for subsequent measurements.</p><p>The effect on the structure of VAR2 upon binding CSA was investigated, but as a result of the nature of the CSA sample and the poorer signal/noise ratio caused by misalignment of the beamline, these studies are currently inconclusive.</p><p>VAR3 data are currently being analyzed. The data measured on VAR3 in the prescence of Nano-gold, show that presumably several VAR3 moieties are bound to each Nano-gold particle, which could explain the precipitation observed by the addition of nano-gold to VAR2.</p></div>		</body>
