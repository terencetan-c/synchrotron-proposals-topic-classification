<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Quantification of the effects of Microbeam Radiation Therapy on brain tumor neoplasm tissue and vascular network by phase contrast microCT. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The overall aim of this research project was to investigate the potential of Phase Contrast micro-CT (PCI-microCT) as a tool to perform multiscale, quantitative comparisons of the treatment effects on brain tissue between two different experimental radiotherapy techniques, namely X-ray micro-beam radiation theraphy (MRT) and proton minibeam radiation theraphy (pMBRT). Specifically, by this experiment and the following experiment MD1121, we could successlfully achieve the carachteraization of MRT radiation-driven effects on rat brain structures via PCI-microCT. These two experiments are the continuation of a prof of concept study performed at the ESRF and published in " <ref type="bibr">Barbone et al., Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 101,4 (2018)</ref>".</p><p>In the experiment MD1037, both tumor-bearing and healhty (i.e. control group) Fisher rats have been used. For the tumor-bearing ones, 9Lglioblastoma cells were injected in the right brain hemisphere following published protocols (Eur. Joor. Rad. 68S (2008) S151-S155; Phys. Med. Biol. 53 ( <ref type="formula">2008</ref>) 861-878). Ten days after tumor inoculation, all the 28 rats (except for the controls) were in vivo irradiated according to the following list: distance and an irradiation field of 5x8 mm 2 . Minibeams were instead 5000 m wide and had a 2000 m center-to-center distance on a field of 6.5x8 mm 2 .</p><p>After the irradiation, all animals were host at the ESRF under the control of the animal facility staff. An intermediate in-vivo Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) was done at 34 days after the irradiation to have a better control on the tumour developement. Animals were euthanized 62 days after irradiation and their brains were extracted and put in a 4% formalin solution. All these procedures were carried out following established ethical regulations.</p><p>The second part of the experiment had the purpose of evaluating ex-vivo, via PCI-microCT, the effects of the different irradiations on rat brains. The propagation-based phase contrast CT imaging (PBI) set-up with a 3 μm optics coupled to a PCO camera and a monochromatic X-ray beam (33 keV) were used to image the full volume of the samples. For each CT stage, 4000 projections were acquired in half-acquisition mode, over 360 degrees with equally spaced acquisition angles.</p><p>Quantitative PCI image analysis has been performed by CT reconstruction with Paganin phase retrieval algorithm and segmentation to derive a 3D visualization of brain healthy and tumor tissue, and a quantitative 3D distribution of both tumoral and healthy vasculature. Rats irradiated with minibeams had a survival similar to that of the control animals. Probably the interbeam spacing was too big for obtaining a good therapaeutic effect and to achieve tumour sterilization. Some examples of the results produced in this analysis are reported in the following figures. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> represents a glioblastoma-bearing rat irradiate with MRT of 600 Gy as peak dose. The remaining tumour after 62 days of survival is pointed out by the yellow arrow while microbeams tissue ablations and microcalcifications along the MRT paths in the thalamus are presented in separate windows. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> shows the case of an healthy irradiated rat with MRT 400 Gy as peak. On the left, a Ca-stained histology highlights the microdeposits and their clustering that are also depicted with great contrast and detail in the adjusted windowing PCI-microCT image on the right. The analysis of the collected PCI-CT data is in progress and we are performing the last histology and immunohistochemistry examinations to validate the results. This experiment has focussed on investigating late-term effects of the administered radiation treatments and the obtained results will be complement by other PCI-CT datasets acquired at different synchrotron facilities by using smaller pixel sizes. This multiscale approach will allow a detailed study of the morphological changes wihtin the irradiated tissues. Nevertheless, tissue ablations and the Fe and Ca deposits that have been observed, attracted the interest of our collaborators expert in neuropathology, who were unable to determine the specific nature of the visualized lesions, and thus recommended to study the produced lesions at earlier stages (e.g. at two weeks post irradiation). For this reason, a new beamtime will be requested at the ESRF. In addition, in order to correctly classify and, lately, understand the mechanisms leading to the observed microcalcifications (Fe and Ca deposits), we also requested and got granted an experiment of Small and Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS &amp; WAXS). This experiment is planned in the next months at the Swiss Light Source (SLS). The results of all this multi-scale and multi-technique study will be collected in a manuscript.
