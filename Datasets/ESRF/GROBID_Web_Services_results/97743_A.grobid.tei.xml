<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Our user group arrived two days in advance to discuss operations with the beamline scientists (Julie Villanova, Victor Vanpeene) and the head of the chemistry laboratory (Harald Müller). Parts of the experimental set-up were installed a day before the beam time. The first 6 h of the beam time were spent on finalizing the experimental set-up and leak-proofing all connections. The set-up was then checked and approved by the safety group.</p><p>Our first measuremements involved the ex situ characterization of individual catalyst particles in the chip-based microreactor system at 17.4 keV (tomographies recorded over 360 degrees). Based on the preliminary reconstructions, we were able to conclude that high resolution tomographies can be recorded with the chip-based reactor (Si3N4 capillary allowed for high X-ray transmission, no or very limited sample movement in the capillary).</p><p>The reactor was then connected to the remaining set-up (gas lines, MFCs, back pressure regulator) and pressurized. Unfortunately, we did not observe a pressure build-up with nitrogen. Upon closer inspection of this first reactor, we located a small hole in the capillary of the reactor (before particle trap). The reactor was most likely damaged during loading with the first particles. Due to this leak, we could not proceed with the ethylene polymerization experiment.</p><p>The procedure was repeated with two additional reactors that were loaded with individual catalyst particles. Both reactors leaked signficantly at the interface between the chipholder and the chip. The etching of the chips during fabrication most likely reduced their thickness, thus leading to a suboptimal contact with the chipholder. Tests performed on previous batches of these reactors did not reveal such anomalies in thickness. We therefore did not expect these issues with the new batch of reactors that was brought to the beamline.</p><p>Our final reactor was damaged while loading it with catalyst particles. The part of the capillary after the trap was ruptured.</p><p>The remaining beam time was dedicated to the ex situ characterizaion of different catalyst systems (silicasupported zirconocene catalyst, Fluid Catalytic Cracking catalyst) in their pristine state as well as in the presence of carbon-based products (e.g., polyethylene, polylpropoylene, coke). For selected samples, we measured individual particles before and after removal of the carbon-based phase. By aligning the two tomographies and computing their difference, we are aiming to locate the carbon-based phase in 3D. Future efforts will be directed towards securing a larger number of functioning reactors for any potential beam time. The fabrication of airtight reactors represents a complex procedure that still requires additional fine-tuning. The reactor technology is, however, ready for application under high temperature (300 °C), high pressure (up to 20 bar) reaction conditions, as is clear from our in-house temperature and pressure testing.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
