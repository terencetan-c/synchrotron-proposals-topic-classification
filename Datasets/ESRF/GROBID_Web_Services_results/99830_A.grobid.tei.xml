<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment SC5275 aimed at measuring the dynamics of proteins in crowded environments by means of X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS). The understanding of molecular interactions in crowded environments is crucial for biological processes. Molecular crowding can dramatically alter molecular motion and thus influence the biological function of proteins. Here, we focused on the globular ferritin protein in cryoprotected solution, i.e. solution of 50w% glycerol in water, which allowed us to explore the accessible time window by increasing the viscosity of the solvent and therefore slowing down the dynamics of the system, as well as to prevent freezing of the sample at cryogenic conditions.</p><p>During the experiment we measured different ferritin concentrations, from 60 to 120 mg/ml, ranging from room temperature down to 210 K, which was the focus of the preliminary analysis, as well as apoferritin solutions and ferritin solutions with alginate. We utilised a Eiger 500k detector located at a distance of 7.11 m from the sample, which was measured in quartz capillaries of 1.5 mm outer diameter at a photon energy of 9 keV. The geometry allowed us to access the q-range between 0.01-0.4 nm -1 . We analysed the flux dependence of the scattering pattern by varying the number of absorbers to establish the radiation damage threshold. Moreover, the radiation damage test was performed for different temperature conditions, from 280 down to 210 K.</p><p>The XPCS analysis of protein solutions is often complicated by the fact that the scattering signal at large momentum transfer q is low. However, the system used in this study allows us to obtain a significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio because of the presence of the iron core inside the protein. According to preliminary data analysis, the high signal allows us to compute intensity autocorrelation functions g 2 at a larger momentum transfer (q ‚âà 0.4 nm -1 ) than ever achieved before for protein systems (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, concentration of 60 mg/ml). The g 2 function is modelled by , where is the</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ùëî 2 (œÑ, ùëû) = 1 + Œ≤ exp[-2(Œì(ùëû) œÑ) Œ± ] Œ±</formula><p>Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts exponent, indicative of the type of motion of the system, the decay rate and Œì Œ≤ the contrast. The two-time correlation function map shows that the measurements were performed in an equilibrium regime, which suggests that the dynamics are not influenced by the beam with driven dynamics or radiation damage (inset of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>).</p><p>In order to study the crowding effect, the measurements were repeated for the concentrations 60, 100, 120 mg/ml at variable temperatures. Preliminary g 2 functions for the most concentrated solution are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, where the colours correspond to the different temperatures (see legend) and we observe that the dynamics is slowed down upon cooling. A summary of the different measurements performed (concentrations, attenuations) is reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, where the diffusion coefficient extracted from the fits is plotted as a function of temperature and compared to the estimated values based on the Stokes-Einstein relation (purple circles). Additionally, from the integrated scattering intensity, it is possible to observe the structure factor peak at q ‚âà 0.3 nm -1 . A deeper analysis of the structure factor peak position for the different concentrations and temperatures can provide insight into the protein-protein interactions from the dilute to the more crowded solution.</p><p>The aim of the experiment was successfully achieved. We were able to measure the cryoprotected ferritin solutions under variable conditions, e.g. flux, concentration and temperature, according to the proposal. The preliminary analysis is very promising and the data are expected to lead to a publication. The beamline staff will be included in the publications as co-authors. The staff was always available during the beamtime and we appreciate their valuable support. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) Intensity autocorrelation functions g 2 of 60 mg/ml ferritin in glycerol 50w% solution, shown for the momentum transfer q=0.08-0.4 nm -1 at 240 K.
