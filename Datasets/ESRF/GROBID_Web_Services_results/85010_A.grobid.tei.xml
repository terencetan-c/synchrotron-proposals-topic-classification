<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During this experiment we used diffraction tomography (DCT) to study the effect of confinement on the crystallization of CaCO3 and CaSO4. This was achieved by investigating the precipitation of these minerals within commercial Controlled Porous Glass rods (CPGs) containing pores that were 7 nm in diameter. CaCO3 and CaSO4 were precipitated within CPG rods by inserting the rod ends into glass tubes and injecting CaCl2 and Na2CO3/(NH4)2SO4 solutions into the glass tubes. Counter diffusion of the ions through the rods results in precipitation of the inorganic salt. At ID11, the system was mounted onto M4 screws and placed parallel to a 40 KeV beam. During our last beamtime (experiment ch4778) we used CPG rods with 1 mm diameters and complemented the DCT data with information from absorption tomography. However, these rods were too fragile for the high reagent concentrations used, where they often fractured due to the force of the crystals forming within them. The current beamtime therefore investigated the crystallization of CaCO3 and CaSO4 within 2.8 mm diameter CPG rods, which prevented this fracture problem. We also investigated the crystallization of these solids in surface-modified CPG rods to investigate the influence of surface chemistry on the crystallization process.</p><p>(1) CaSO4 crystallization in uncoated CPG rods and carboxylate-functionalised CPG rods: Firstly, we followed CaSO4 crystallization in nanopores by DCT for 24 h in uncoated rods at high (3M) and low (250 mM) concentrations. In both cases, we observed the formation of large bassanite crystals in the porous rods even at high solution concentrations. Bassanite is known to be very unstable in bulk solution at room temperature but was stable in the pores for over 24 h under the same reaction conditions. We also obtained new information about the mechanism of crystallization of CaSO4. Amorphous calcium sulfate (ACS) was the first phase to be detected in the pores and transformed to bassanite over time. This is the first in situ study to show that ACS is a precursor to bassanite (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>When modifying the surface chemistry of the porous rods with a carboxyl functionality, gypsum precipitation was induced and both gypsum and bassanite crystals nucleated in the pores. Again, a new understanding of this process was obtained. For the first time we saw that bassanite crystals did not redissolve in the presence of gypsum, but that both polymorphs coexisted (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This is entirely different behaviour to that seen in bulk solution and gives us new information about the role that confinement plays on crystallization. In bulk solution, crystallization processes are dynamic and every crystal nucleating is affected by other crystals nucleating in the same solution. This process does not appear to occur in confinement. Interaction between crystals forming in such restricted volumes (7 nm pores) was not observed in any of our experiments and gypsum did not grow at the expense of bassanite. These results have never been reported before and are extremely important to the formation of Ca sulfate in the environment.</p><p>In beamtime ch4778 we were able to detect large amounts of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC), vaterite and calcite at different positions in uncoated CPG rods. We obtained similar results here, but also observed the formation of small aragonite crystals close to the carbonate reservoir. This is very interesting since aragonite is a metastable phase that is very difficult to obtain at room temperature without the use of additives. Once again confinement provided a way to stabilize metastable phases at room temperature. We did not observed any significant difference when crystallization took place in functionalised rods; calcite and vaterite were the main phases to form in the pores.</p><p>During this beamtime we confirmed the success of our methodolology for studying our system. Indeed, as far as we are aware, synchrotron DCT is the only technique capable of identifying the phases of the crystals forming in-situ in the CPGs. No lab-based analysis has come close to the understanding gained here. During this beamtime we achieved new insight into the effects of confinement on crystallization. These studies could be now extended to other solids such as CaPO4 and CaC2O4, where both are highly important in healthcare issues.   References: [1] Jiang, Ward, Chem. Soc. Revs. 2014, 43, 2066.
