<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: For review purpose only.</p><p>Von Willebrand factor (vWF) plays a crucial role in thrombus formation after vascular damage. It forms a bridge between collagen exposed at sites of injury and glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) located on the surface of blood platelets. Binding to GpIb is mediated via the A1 domain of vWF. Mutations in the A1 domain, so called vWD type 2B mutations, result in spontaneous binding of vWF to GpIb. Patients suffering from these mutations manifest bleeding episodes. In order to investigate an explanation for this spontaneous binding to GpIb, we solved the crystal structure of the A1 domain to compare with models of the A1 domain containing mutation R543Q. Diffraction data were collected to 2.25 Å resolution on a 170 * 80 * 20 µm 3 crystal (Rmerge 6.5 %; redundancy 3.5). The crystal has space group P2(1) (a=76.83 Å, b=60.65 Å, c=87.66 Å, β=95.071) with 4 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to a R-factor of 20.7 % and a free R-factor of 27.5 %. Conformational changes were visible in the peptides flanking the A1 domain. Interpretation of this conformational change is complicated by the presence of Cd++ ions interacting with the flanking peptides in the R543Q mutant and not in the wt molecule.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><note type="other">Glycoprotein Ibα</note><p>Glycoprotein (Gp) Ibα is a member of the Gp Ib-IX-V adhesion complex located on the surface of blood platelets. This complex is involved in von Willebrand Factor mediated adhesion of platelets to collagen, an essential first step in the arrest of bleeding. We have expressed a 33 kDa N-terminal fragment of GpIbα in mammalian cells. This fragment contains a complete von Willebrand Factor binding site. Plate-like crystals were obtained with dimension of up to 0.3 mm x 0.3 mm and a thickness of about 10 _m. Most crystals suffer from disorder in one direction. About one out of 8 crystals is suitable for data collection. Unfortunately, crystal quality can not be judged from crystal morphology and no significant diffraction data can be measured on our in house equipment. Therefore a significant amount of data collection time at the ESRF must be spend on identifying suitable crystals. A first native data set to a maximal resolution of 2.0 Å was collected on ID14-EH2 (native 1 in Table ). This data set did not process very well due to high mosaicity in one direction and considerable radiation damage. A second native dataset (native 2) collected on ID14-EH2 is of better overall quality, but has a somewhat lower resolution due to the use of a shorter exposure time of 2 seconds/degree of oscillation. Exposing a different region of the same crystal for 10 seconds/degree revealed diffraction spots up to 1.8 Å resolution, but collection of a complete data set was not succesful due to radiation damage. A search for heavy atom derivatives was initiated. Fluorescenece scans recorded on ID29 suggested that K 2 PtCl 4 and Na 3 IrCl 6 were present in back-soaked crystals, while HgCl 2 was not. Peak data sets that are complete to 2.5 Å resolution were collected for Pt and Ir. For Ir data were also collected at the inflection point and at a remote wavelength. Data collection on a sodium bromide soaked crystal was hampered by insufficient insensity of the X-ray beam and will be repeated.</p><p>The Pt and Ir datasets did not contain an anomalous signal. No heavy atom positions could be identified from isomorphous difference-Pattersons. This could be due to binding of the metalions to a disordered hexa-histidine tag. Since the expression system used for GpIb_ does not allow for Se-Met labeling and molecular replacement with partial homology models has not been succesful, the search for heavy atom derivatives will be continued.</p><p>wavelength (Å) resolution (Å) Rmerge (%) &lt;I&gt;/&lt;_&gt; completeness (%) native 1 0.9330 2.0 9.2 (36.8) 10.1 (3.2) 98.5 native 2 0.9330 2.2 7.5 (34.5) 14.3 (2.9) 89.9 Pt peak 1.0719 2.3 5.2 (17.0) 40.8 (7.5) 89.6 Ir peak 1.1053 2.3 7.3 (24.2) 15.7 (3.2) 93.5 inflection 1.1056 2.3 7.3 (29.8) 15.1 (3.0) 91.3 remote 1.1170 2.3 6.3 (29.7) 10.6 (1.7) 49.5* Values in parenthesis apply to high resolution shell. *Incomplete data due to end of beam time.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Lipase of Bacillus subtilis We are interested in obtaining more insight in the broad specificity of this lipase and the enantioselective properties of the hydrolysis reaction of this enzyme. We therefore covalently bound a pair of enantiomeric substrate-mimicks into the active site.</p><p>A data set of one bound enatiomer was collected on <ref type="bibr">ID14-2 (14-4-2001)</ref>. The other on ID29 <ref type="bibr">(1-7-2001)</ref>. The data characteristics and statistics are as follows:</p><p>Space group P2</p><p>1 2 1 2 1 Unit cell 40 x 83 x 96Å 3 Data collection ID14-2 ID29 Resolution (Å) 1.8 1.8 Completeness 40-1.8Å 88.4% 99.6% Completeness 1.84-1.80Å 56.2% 94.5% I/sigma(I) 40-1.8Å 19.4 10.1 I/sigma(I) 1.84-1.80Å 3.8 3.0 R-merge 40-1.8Å 5.5% 17.0% R-merge 1.84-1.80Å 21.1% 37.9% Wilson B-factor (truncate): 14.6 11.5 Wilson scale (truncate): 38.9 25.1 Refinement current R-factor 17.8% 20.9% current R free -factor 21.3% 24.3%</p><p>Electron density calculated with both these data sets clearly showed the two different enantiomeric inhibitors bound in the active site. The detailed interactions of the inhibitor with the lipase are being analysed at the moment. The data collected on ID29 has however too bad data statistics and higher R-factors to be able to use it for a publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Esterases for drug synthesis The application of enzymes as catalysts provides a convenient way to prepare synthetic chemicals in an ecologically more responsible fashion than is usually the case with conventional chemical methods. Moreover, enzymes are capable of synthesizing chiral compounds in an enantioselective way, which is crucial for the production of countless drugs.</p><p>In our group we study the α-amino acid ester hydrolases (AEH's) of Xanthomonas citri and Acetobacter turbidans. These enzymes transfer the acyl group of an α-amino acid ester to water, but are also capable of transferring it to a β-lactam nucleus. The enzymes can thus be used for the production of synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins.</p><p>The AEH from Xanthomonas citri crystallises into rectangular blocks with a typical size of 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.05 mm. Though all crystals have the same shape, they exhibit three different lattice symmetries : primitive tetragonal, primitive orthorhombic and primitive monoclinic. Of these, the monoclinic crystals (space group P2 1 ) are the most amenable to X-ray analysis.</p><p>A selenium derivative has been prepared and crystallised. Part of the selenium oxidises readily, so that careful reduction with 10 mM DTT in mother liquor just before freezing is necessary. From the selenium-labeled crystals, three datasets could be collected :</p><p>A full three-wavelength MAD dataset was collected on ID29 from a crystal of space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 . The statistics are in table 1. These data were collected from a crystal that showed two peaks in the fluorescence spectrum which were attributed to reduced and oxidised selenium. No selenium positions could be found from these data. Subsequent crystals were subjected to reduction as described above. A single wavelength SAD experiment was done on ID14-2 with a crystal of space group P2 1 . A 2.0 Å dataset was collected (statistics in table 1) but the anomalous signal was to weak for structure solution. Recently, a SAD dataset was collected from another P2 1 crystal at the selenium peak wavelength on ID29, which shows clear anomalous signal and structure solution is under way.</p><p>Crystallization experiments with the AEH from Acetobacter turbidans gave two crystal forms: non-birefringent rhombic dodecahedra (0.1x0.1x0.1 mm) and birefringent prisms (0.4x0.15x0.1 mm). The dodecahedra belong to either space group I23 or I2 1 3 and diffracted to 3.0 Å on the ID14-2 beamline. Native data and three heavy atom soaks have been collected (table <ref type="table">1</ref>), but difference Pattersons show no peaks. The prisms have primitive orthorhombic symmetry, and diffract to 3.5 Å on a home X-ray source. These crystals have not yet been measured on a synchrotron source. We are preparing a selenium derivative.</p><p>The naproxen esterase from Bacillus subtilis is another enzyme that is studied in our group. It hydrolyzes esters of arylpropionates with high enantioselectivity, which makes it useful in the synthesis of anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen. Crystals of this enzyme have been grown as early as 1993. A mercury and a platinum derivative have been identified. We are also preparing a selenomethione labeled sample. We have collected a dataset from a crystal soaked for 30 s. in a 1.0 M sodium bromide solution on the bromide edge, but no anomalous signal could be detected.</p><p>Protein Beamline _ (Å) Space group unit cell dim.
