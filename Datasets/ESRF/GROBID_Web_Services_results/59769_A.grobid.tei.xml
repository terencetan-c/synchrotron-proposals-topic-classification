We measured specular X-ray reflectivity (XRR) to extract the perpendicular structure of the lipid monolayer at the air/water interface on different ionic liquid subphases. We simultaneously recorded</p></div>

In   Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref> depicts the fluorescence spectra of DOPC monolayer on CDP ionic liquid below (blue curve) and above (orange curve) the critical angle. The fluorescence signal from P is stronger below the critical angle than the signal above the critical angle indicating that phosphorus is enriched at the air-water interface. This is due to the phosphorus content of DOPC lipids and to the enrichment of dihydrogenphosphate molecules near the DOPC monolayer. Similarly, the same tendency was observed in the measurements that were performed on CP ionic liquid (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>).</p><p>However, detailed quantitative analysis is required in order to determine the later concentration of each element at the air-water interface. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>addition, as control measurements we recorded the fluorescence spectra of DOPC monolayers on KCl containing buffer and on CaCl containing buffer. The DOPC were deposited at the air-water interface and then compressed to a surface pressure of 20 mN/m.</figDesc></figure>

The fluorescence signals from phosphorus (P), chloride (Cl) and potassium (K) are visible. The signals from Cl and K recorded below the critical angle are slightly weaker than those recorded above the critical angle indicating that both Cl and K ions are depleted from the air-water interface. On the other side, the fluorescence signal from P is visible below the critical angle and disappears and from the spectrum taken above the critical angle. The P signal comes from the phosphate group within the DOPC head group implying the formation of stable lipid monolayer.</figDesc></figure>
