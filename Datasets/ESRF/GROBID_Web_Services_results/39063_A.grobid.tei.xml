<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Structures of sorption complexes that hazardous radionuclides or heavy metals form on mineral surfaces are key information to develop thermodynamic models for reliable prediction of their adsorption amounts in soils, ground waters and deep geological environments. Such information is never obtained from macroscopic adsorption experiments only and must be determined independently via in-situ spectroscopy and/or theoretical calculations. In this study we investigated the structures of uranyl (UO 2 2+ ) sorption complexes on gibbsite ( -Al(OH) 3 ) with silicic acid (H 4 SiO 4 ) by extended Xray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The obtained structural parameters were used to constain density functional theory (DFT) calculations and to optimize plausible sorption geometries of UO 2 2+ on gibbsite.</p><p>The EXAFS measurements of U-L III edge were carried out in fluorescence mode at 15 K. All sorption samples were prepared in N 2 -filled glove box. The concentrations of UO 2 2+ , H 4 SiO 4 , gibbsite and NaClO 4 were 10 μM, 0.5 mM, 2 g/L and 0.1 M, respectively, and the pH was adjusted to 5.5 or 9.6. For comparison the sorption samples without H 4 SiO 4 were also prepared in a similar way. Gibbsite with adsorbed UO 2 2+ was separated by centrifugation and the resulting wet pastes were loaded into EXAFS sample holders. The concentrations of UO 2 2+ in the supernatants were measured by an ICP-MS to determine the surface loading of UO 2 2+ on gibbsite. In all samples more than 90 % of UO</p><p>2 2+ adsorbed on gibbsite both with and without H 4 SiO 4 . Adsorption structures of uranyl onto gibbsite were optimized by DFT calculations with B3LYP functional. A neutral Al hexamer cluster, Al 6 (OH) 18 (H 2 O) 6 , was used as a model of gibbsite surface. Model clusters with adsorbed UO 2 2+ and H 4 SiO 4 , if present, were fully optimized without any symmetry and structural constraints. Solvation was taken into account by explicitly placing water molecules on the equatorial plane of UO 2 2+ in geometry optimization and further performing conductor-like polarizable continuum model calculation with the optimized structures.</p><p>In the absence of H 4 SiO 4 EXAFS spectroscopy revealed the same interatomic distances of the UO 2 2+ coordination environment, R U-Oax 1.80 Å, R U-Oeq 2.40 Å, and towards the gibbsite surface, R U-O 2.87 Å, R U-Al 3.38 Å. In addition, two U-U distances were observed, 3.92 Å at pH 9.7 and 4.30 Å at pH 5.6, both with coordination numbers (CN) of 1. The shorter U-U distance is close to that of the aqueous uranyl hydroxo dimer, UO 2 (OH) 2 , reported as 3.875 Å in the literature <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The longer U-U distance (4.30 Å) at acidic pH, however, is not in line with known aqueous uranyl polymer complexes. The DFT calculations of monomeric uranyl sorption complexes show an energetic preference of the corner-sharing versus the edge-sharing configuration on the edge face of gibbsite. The energy difference is so small, however, that possibly both surface species may coexist. In contrast to the edge sites, sorption to the basal face was energetically not favorable. Based on the EXAFS findings we further refined dimeric surface complexes with DFT. Two structural models were obtained: in the acidic region, the observed long U-U distance can be explained with a distortion of the uranyl dimers to form both a corner-sharing and an edge-sharing linkage to neighboring Al octahedral, leading to R U- U = 4.150 Å (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1 (a)</ref>). In the alkaline region, a corner-sharing uranyl dimer complex is most favorable (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1 (b)</ref>). The U-O path at 2.87 Å in the EXAFS spectra arises from the oxygen atom linking two Al cations in corner-sharing arrangement.</p><p>In the presence of H 4 SiO 4 distinct broadening or even splitting of the U-O eq shell was observed. It is also apparent that the backscattering from Si is now recognizable in additon to that from Al around 3.3 Å: R U-Si = 3.09 and 3.82 with CN 1 for acidic pH; R U-Si = 3.07 with CN 1 for alkaline pH. These findings suggest the formation of Al-O-U-O-SiO 4 H n ternary sorption complexes (the type-B ternary complex [2]). At acidic pH the contribution of neighboring U in the FT modulus was rather small (&lt; 2 %), suggesting that complexation with H 4 SiO 4 on gibbsite surface prevented UO 2 2+ clustering. The structures of the ternary sorption complexes were optimized in DFT calculations on the basis of the obtained EXAFS parmeters and the corresponding sorption geometries in the binary system. The obtained structures consistent with the EXAFS results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1 (c)</ref> and <ref type="figure">(d)</ref>. It was turned out that silicic acid coordinated to sorbed UO 2 2+ via monodenate complexation at at acidic pH (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>(c)), while via bidentate complexation at alkaline pH (Figure 1. (d)).</figDesc></figure>
