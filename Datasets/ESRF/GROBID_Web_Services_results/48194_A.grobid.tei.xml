<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Hydrophobically-coated gold nanoparticles can be successfully inserted in the hydrophobic regions of oil swollen lamellar phases. We have recently shown that confinement in the hydrophobic regions promotes a new repulsive interaction whose range varies as the lamellar period d 1 . The physical origin of this repulsion is still under debate, but it could be linked to the fluctuations of the water membrane. The proposal was mainly focus on the effect of the water membrane (in blue in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) flexibility on this new interaction range. The main results of the previous run on D2AM are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. 1 [1] Pansu, B; Lecchi, A; Constantin, D; Impéror-Clerc, M; Veber, M; Dozov, I. Insertion of Gold</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main objectives of the run:</head><p>• The first objective was to try to understand how the flexibility of the water membrane affects the interaction between the gold nanoparticles inserted in the oilswollen hydrophobic layers. • The second objective was to increase the concentration of gold nanoparticles inside the hydrophobic layer. • As we also plan to use other oil than dodecane we have also quickly tested the bulk interaction of gold nanoparticles in toluene often used as a swelling agent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparation of the samples</head><p>Samples are usually prepared by adding a suspension of nanoparticles in oil to a pure lamellar phase.</p><p>In the first experiment 1 (D2AM 2010), the composition of the pure lamellar phase that had been used was : SDS 30.6 w%, pentanol 22w%, water, 47.4% (labelled as P)</p><p>The flexibility of the water layer can be decreased by changing the composition. In this second run, the composition of the pure lamellar phase that have been used was: SDS 43.9 w%, pentanol 21.8w%, water, 34.3% (labelled as Q) During his Phd, E. Freyssingeas has shown that the Q phase was 10 times less flexible than the P phase (κ Q =10 κ P ). In such a lamellar system, the fluctuation correlation length corresponding to the fluctuation maximum wavelength is expected to be equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">kT d κ π ξ 3 32 = .</formula><p>Depending on the values of κ, one thus expect for d=50Å : ξ=45 Å (q=0.14 Å -1 ) for the swollen P phase and ξ=142Å (q=0.04 Å -1 ) for the swollen Q phase. Therefore this length is expected to be three times larger in the Q type phases than in the P type phases for the same value of the lamellar period d. Three different swellings of the P phase had been used: A: d=5.3 nm B: d=6.4 nm C : d=78.5 nm We have used three different swellings of the Q phase with the same ranges of lamellar period and the sames labels (A, B and C). The gold nanoparticles that have been inserted have a gold core of about 2.3 nm and are coated with hexane-thiol (with layer thickness about 0.68 nm). Different volume fractions have been used: 10 w%, 20 w% in the swelling oil (dodecane+pentanol), as in the run performed in 2010, but also 30 w% since we wanted to test the effect of increasing volume fraction. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>  All the samples have been sucked in flat glass capillaries (2mmx0.1 mm or 1mmx0.1mm). An oscillatory flow was applied to some of them in order to promote homeotropic alignment, that is when the membranes are parallel to the glass surfaces. All the capillaries were sealed to prevent water and pentanol evaporation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments</head><p>All the capillaries were scanned vertically and horizontally in order to find good orientation (planar or homeotropic). The period was measured for all the patterns in order to check inhomogneities that could be induced by a bad sealing. Samples that have been prepared with the Q lamellar phase where the water membrane is expected to be less flexible than in the P phase has revealed more difficult to align. -0,15 -0,1 -0,05 2,77555756156289E-017 0,05 0,1 0,15 0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1 1,2 1,4 Figure 4:</p><p>In-plane structure factor in swollen Q lamellar phase doped with gold nanoparticles (20w%). in red QA20, in green QB20, in blue QC20.</p><p>The interaction is still repulsive but its range is not so different from the P phase.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main Results</head><p>Conclusion 1 : Unfortunately the role of the flexibility of the membranes could not be clearly established. Theoretical models are at present developed by J.B. Fournier (MSC, Paris-Diderot) to understand whether fluctuations can induce repulsive interaction and what would be the range of this interaction.</p><p>Conclusion 2: Increasing the particle concentration destabilizes the lamellar phase but the Q phase is more easily destabilized than the P phase. It is well known that insertion is favored by flexibility. Before destabilization, a strong anisotropic scattering is observed at low angle and could be due to anisotropic aggregates. A detailed analysis of the scattering profile at low angle must be done to check this assumption. At large enough concentration, the lateral interaction would thus become attractive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion 3:</head><p>In the experiments performed on D2AM in 2010, the structure factor at small q could not be explained by van der Waals interaction and steric repulsion between the ligand shells. Since we plan to swell surfactant phases by other oils like cyclohexane or toluene, we wanted to check the interaction between gold nanoparticles and surprisingly, the behavior of S(q) at small q reveals very different for particles suspended either in dodecane or in toluene.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>: Structure factor measured as a function of q in Å -1 for dispersion of gold nanoparticles with C12-thiol ligands either in dodecane in red or in toluene in blue (10 w%)</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>: Structure factor S(q) as a function of q in Å -1 for dispersion of gold nanoparticles with C6-thiol ligands either in dodecane in red or in toluene in blue (10 w%)</p><p>Further studies with various concentrations, temperatures and solvents are required to describe properly the effect of the solvent on the ligand shell and thus on the interaction between particles.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 : Schematic drawing of the mixed system</figDesc><graphic coords="1,215.04,229.56,165.00,96.36" type="bitmap" /></figure>
