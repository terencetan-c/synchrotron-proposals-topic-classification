<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> we show data collected using the three techniques in tandem during the first propane dehydrogenation cycle for the 13 wt% Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. The initial features observed in the spectra included a distinct 1s-4d pre-edge feature at 20001.5 eV in the Mo K-edge ED-XANES, a strong LMCT band at 470 nm in the UV-Vis and a band in the Raman spectra at 1350 cm -1 (BN internal standard). The results are consistent with the presence of Mo 6+ species dispersed on the catalyst surface probably in a mixture of tetrahedral/distorted octahedra environments. Only significant changes in the UV-vis absoprtion were observed to occur in the first 10 minutes of the propane dehydrogenation step although a small decrease in the baseline intensity in the Raman was observed and very small changes in the ED-XANES data (which included a decline in pre-edge peak intensity, an increase in the 1s-5p transition feature at 20021.7 eV) which continued until the reaction ceased some 20 minutes later. The changes observed in the Raman and UV-Vis data appear to be associated with the formation of coke on the catalyst surface.</p><p>We were able to repeat these measurements twice more (after oxidative regeneration) and found that due to changes in the catalyst local structure the performance differed. Furthermore we also studied the behaviour of the corresponding lower loaded Mo/Al 2 O 3 material and Mo/SiO 2 material and compared their catalytic performance under the same conditions. An early analysis of the results suggested that there were differences in redox behaviour between the different loadings on the catalysts and on the different types of support but critically this combination of techniques is able to show why this is so. Further data analysis is currently in progress.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During this experimental time we were able to further develop a setup for obtaining combined in situ ED-EXAFS, UV-Vis and Raman spectroscopy in order to study heterogeneous catalysts under real working conditions. To our best knowledge, this is the first in situ device which couples three spectroscopic techniques in one reactor which focuses on the same spot of a metal oxide catalyst under true reaction conditions and is capable of delivering sub second time resolution. The acquisition times for the three techniques ranged from 50-2000 ms for 1 scan although in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio multiple spectra were recorded and summed. Typically for these experiments the acquisition times used were 400 ms for EDXAFS data, 1 s for Raman, 2 s for the UV-Vis and 10 s for the mass spectrometer. However due to the time delay for read out from the Princeton detector and the need to shutter the Raman laser in order to avoid saturation of the UV-Vis signal the time resolution between each acquisition was reduced to approximately 4-5 s for the EDXAFS, 10 s per UV-Vis and 15 s per Raman spectra.</p><p>In order to test this setup we carried out a series of studies using 13 -3 wt% Mo/Al 2 O 3 and Mo/SiO 2 incipient wetness impregnated catalysts during successive reduction (5% C 3 H 8 in Helium)/oxidation (5% O 2 in Helium) cycles at 550Â°C. Since the three techniques are sensitive to changes in the molybdenum oxidation/coordination states it was possible to obtain complementary information on the catalysts behaviour and therefore the set-up allows us to discriminate between the dynamics of both catalysts under reaction conditions, as well as to identify the active site and the deactivation pathways.</p></div>			</div>
