<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The enzyme H-ras p21is a small guanine binding protein which is involved in signal transduction. It switches between an active, GTP-bound state to an inactive, GDP-bound state. The hydrolysis of GTP to GDP involves conformational changes of the protein that occur on the timescale of several minutes. Since H-ras p21 was one of the first proteins investigated by time-resolved and kinetic crystallography we use it as a model system for the current project. The aim of this project is to develop a fluorescence spectrometer which is capable to detect in a time-resolved manner fluorescence changes on protein crystals. With this method, it should be possible to detect the point at which the protein crystal reached a certain intermediate state that shall be investigated. The structure of this state can then be investigated by X-ray diffraction.</p><p>To introduce a fluorescence sensitive probe to the protein, we introduced a cysteine in one of the regions of the protein that is involved in the conformational changes (Y32C) and labelled it with IANBD, a small fluorescence label which is highly sensitive in its fluorescence properties to environmental changes. We used the isomeric pure forms of R-caged GTP and S-caged GTP to obtain crystals with diffraction power of 1.25A and higher. The crystallization conditions for the modified protein were optimized in order to obtain small (&lt; 100µm) crystals with high diffracting power, which is important to guarantee a homogenous release of the caged GTP.</p><p>The light source of our experimental setup is a He-Cd-Laser (Laser-Class 3b) that delivers monochromatic light at two different wavelengths.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Project: Crystal structure determination of the human PAPS synthetases 1</head><p>To add sulfate to biomolecules, organisms synthesize the high energy sulfate ester 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS). In humans this reaction is catalyzed by the bifunctional PAPS synthetases 1 and 2. In the first step ATP sulfurylase replaces the beta-phosphate of ATP by sulfate and releases pyrophosphate. In the second step the newly formed adenosine-phosphosulfate (APS) is phosphorylated by APS kinase. Phosphorylation of the 3' position of the ribose yields the final product PAPS. Until today bacterial, fungal and yeast ATP sulfurylases and a fungal APS kinase have been characterized by crystallography. In contrast to the human bifunctional protein these enzymes exist as single polypeptides. Homology modeling of the human enzyme predicts three to four separate domains. We obtained crystals of human PAPS synthetase 1 (hPAPSS-1) and collected a native data set at SLS, Villigen. At ESRF could collect two mercury data sets (MX-102) which allowed us in combination with molecular replacement to determine the phases for this project. The crystals used so far did not contain any of the ligands or substrates for the protein. Therefore, we soaked the crystals with different substrates or inhibitors and collected different data sets.</p></div>

The periplasmic Sox enzyme system that oxidizes thiosulfate to sulfuric acid has been studied in detail from Paracoccus versutus and Paracoccus pantotrophus. The sox gene cluster in P. pantotrophus consists of 15 genes. The seven genes soxXYZABCD code for proteins which are crucial in the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds in vitro.

Thiosulfate is believed to be covalently bound to the thiol of a conserved cysteine of the SoxY subunit by the c-type cytochrome complex SoxXA yielding cysteine thiosulfonate.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Project:</head><p>Crystal structure determination of AF-reductase</p><p>Glycogen gives rise to 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (AF) which is then reduced to 1,5-anhydro-Dmannitol (AM) in bacteria. An enzyme that catalyzes in a NADPH dependend manner the reduction of AF to AM was isolated and purified to homogenity from bacteria. Its molecular mass is 34.8 kDa on the basis of the cDNA sequence. The observed catalytic properties and the amino acid sequence rule out the possibility, that the isolated protein is identical with any known reductase. The unique catalytic potential of the enzyme AFreductase was demonstrated by preparative conversions of a variety of carbohydrates, and by extensive chemical characterisation of the reaction product. The studies revealed, that this enzyme can be a efficent tool in carbohydrate chemistry. On the basis of these products, strategies will be developed for the convenient production of sugar-derived synthons, rare sugars, fine chemicals and drug combining biotechnical applications and chemical methods.</p><p>We have succesfully crystallized the native enzyme. At this beamtime we have collected a first native data set under cryo conditions. </p></div>
