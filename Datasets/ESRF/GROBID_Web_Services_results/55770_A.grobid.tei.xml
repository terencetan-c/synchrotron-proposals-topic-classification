<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is an anionic polysaccharide consisting of a repeating disaccharide unit composed of D-glucuronic acid and D-N-acetylglucosamine, linked via Œ≤-1,4 and Œ≤-1,3 glycosidic bonds. HA is naturally present in the human body, such as in the skin, cartilage and the vitreous humour. Chitosan (CS) is the only positively charged, naturally occurring polysaccharide. It is obtained from the partial deacetylation of chitin, its parent polymer extracted from the exoskeleton of crustaceans or endoskeleton of cephalopods. Hence, chitosan is a copolymer of N-acetyl glucosamine and glucosamine, known for its low toxicity, bioactivity, biodegradability and mucoadhesion.</p><p>Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) were prepared from CS and HA mixtures in aqueous solutions. To this end, we developed a specific processing route which can be seen as a green process since it takes place in water, without any organic solvent. This method consisted in elaborating a homogeneous mixture of the two polysaccharides at high salt concentration. Then, the mixture was dialyzed, leading to the self-assembly of the two polymers, as already described for CS and Dextran Sulfate by Costalat et al. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> A systematic study was undertaken by varying the acetylation degree and the molar mass of chitosan. By using the dialysis method against water, we determined some critical parameters accounting for the transition from homogeneous aqueous solutions of CS and HA to coacervates or dispersed precipitates. SAXS analysis is a convenient method to analyze the structure of polyelectrolytes offering a characterization of solution ordering by the features of the so-called polyelectrolyte peak. Polyelectrolyte complexes can also be studied to evidence their nanostructure i.e. ladder-like or scrambled egg-like associations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head><p>In this work, we used a CS from shrimp shell provided by Mahtani Pvt. Ltd. (India). Chitosan was reacetylated in homogeneous media to study the impact of the DA and depolymerized by nitrous deamination to study the impact of the molecular weight.</p><p>HA was used as received from HTL (France) with a molecular weight Mw ‚âà 1000 kg/mol. SAXS experiments were performed in D2AM Beamline from 22 nd to 24 th of October and from 1 st to 3 rd of December 2014. The sample-to-detector distance was about 1.15 meters, the incident energy of X-rays was set at 17 keV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure of HA in solution</head><p>First of all, we studied the conformation of the chains of HA in solution. Two important parameters were the polymer concentration and the salt concentration in the solution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of the concentration</head><p>We prepared HA solutions with varying concentrations. The corresponding SAXS profiles I(q) are represented on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> for a q range from 0.01 to 0.32 √Ö -1 .</p><p>For all the concentrations, we observed a broad peak in the analyzed q range. This peak is characteristic of the conformation of polyelectrolytes chains in solution. Due to repulsive electrostatic interactions between the polyelectrolyte chains, the polymer chains adopt a conformation such as typical repeated distances appear, characterized by the so-called "polyelectrolyte peak". The evolution of the location of this peak with polymer concentration is related to the hydrophobicity /hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte in aqueous solutions.</p><p>As HA concentration increases, the SAXS diagrams revealed that the polyelectrolyte peak was shifted to higher q values, corresponding to smaller inter-chains distances (or correlation distances). We performed a Lorentz fitting on the curves, which led to the position of the maximum intensity of the peak q max . The values are reported on Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Then, the position q max is plotted as a function of the HA concentration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>For polyelectrolytes in solution, a scaling model proposed by Dobrynin et al. 2 consists in considering the polyelectrolyte chains conformation as beads necklaces. Depending on the polymer concentration, it predicts a transition from a string-controlled conformation (where the correlation length Œæ is larger than the string length; q max ‚àù Cp 1/2 ) to a pearl necklace model where the chain conformation is governed by the beads (when Œæ is of the order of the distance between the beads; q max ‚àù Cp 1/3 ).</p><p>HA Concentration Position qmax (√Ö -1 ) C 1 0.031 C 2 0.040 C 3 0.055 C 4 0.073 C 5 0.085 C 6 0.092 Table 1: Results of the Lorentz fitting on SAXS curves.</p><p>In the following complexation study, the HA concentration will be about 3% so the conformation of HA chains will be in the beads-controlled domain. The correlation length, i.e the distance between the beads can be determined with equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>). The calculated correlation length Œæ was found about 74 √Ö. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">ùúâ = 2ùúã ùëûùëöùëéùë• ‚ÅÑ<label>(1)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Influence of the salt concentration</head><p>As we prepare the HA and CS mixture in presence of salts, we studied the evolution of the chain conformation in the presence presence of salts.</p><p>We prepared HA solutions at fixed concentrations and with various amounts of added sodium chloride. The SAXS diagrams (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) revealed an outstanding reproducibility. In the salt-free solution, we found again the well-defined polyelectrolyte peak. As the salt concentration increases, the scattered intensity increases and the polyelectrolyte peak disappears for sodium chloride concentration higher than 0.1 mol.L -1 . These diagrams also revealed the presence of a pseudoisosbestic point, reflecting the existence of only two possible structural states. The first state corresponds to the classical polyelectrolyte conformation of a salt-free polyelectrolyte solution, and the other state corresponds to a more hydrophobic context with aggregated chains. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study of the structure of PECs</head><p>A series of PECs have been prepared varying the charge ratio of CS with respect to the charges of HA.</p><p>The HA concentration was kept fixed for the whole study and the CS concentration was varied depending on the expected ratio and the DA. This part of the work focuses on the comparison of polyelectrolyte complexes obtained at two charge ratios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Charge ratio r = r 1</head><p>Polyelectrolyte complexes were formed by desalting a homogeneous mixture of HA and CS with a charge ratio r = r 1 . The starting salt concentration was the same for all the samples and desalting was achieved by dialysis against deionized water. The resulting PECs (opalescent/turbid solutions) were analyzed by SAXS. Here, we compared the structure of PECs with different DA for CS with medium molecular weight. The diagram of the free-salt HA solution at the same concentration has been added for the sake of comparison (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>For all the DAs, the SAXS diagrams revealed the existence of the polyelectrolyte peak. The position of this peak is almost independent of the DA of CS. As the CS is added in default, we can assume that all the CS is completely complexed with the HA and the polyelectrolyte peak can be attributed to partially-complexed chains of HA. Compared to the HA solution, the position q max is slightly different and is shifted to lower q values, i.e. to higher values of the correlation length Œæ.</p><p>At low q values (inferior to 0.04 √Ö -1 ) scattering is due to aggregates that increase with DA. These observations are consistent with the macroscopic observations of turbidity. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Charge ratio r = r 2</head><p>Here, polyelectrolyte complexes were formed by desalting a homogeneous mixture of HA and CS with a charge ratio r = r 2 . Again, the started salt concentration was the same for all the samples and desalting was achieved by dialysis against deionized water. The resulting PECs (coacervates) were analyzed by SAXS. Here, we compared the structure of PECs with CS of various DA but similar molecular weight.</p><p>For all the DAs, the SAXS diagrams (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) do not disclosed the existence of the classical polyelectrolyte peak. The CS concentration was important enough to suppress the polyelectrolyte behavior. The observed differences in the scattered intensities are probably impacted by the concentration variations as the syneresis leading to coacervates is difficult to control. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and perspectives</head><p>We studied the conformation of HA in salt-free solution and in presence of salts. We further characterized the structure of the polyelectrolyte complexes formed by association of HA with CS by mixed solution desalting. At low CS concentration, the SAXS diagrams revealed that the conformation of HA chains is not heavily affected and that the soluble PECs exhibit a behavior similar to that of HA alone. When the CS quantity is increased, the PECs take the form of coacervates, i.e. a dense phase containing the two complexed polymers with a completely different nanostructure.</p><p>In order to improve our understanding of the formation of the PECs, in particular for coacervate systems, it could be interesting to evaluate the impact of the concentration of CS on the chains conformation (depending on the DA and the molar mass of CS).</p><p>On the other hand, we also found out that desalting a homogeneous solution of CS and HA in an acidic media (pH &lt; 4) led to highly stretchable coacervates. The SAXS characterization could give us information about the structure which could explain the interesting mechanical behavior of these materials. )</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 : SAXS analysis of HA in solution at different concentrations.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,137.15,373.88,317.19,225.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
