Murray* Dr. James Duncan* Mr Karim Maghlaoui* Dr. Joanna Kargul* Report:</p><p>This report covers 6 shifts of beam time 3 on ID14-2 and 3 on ID29. For both sets of shifts a few hours were lost to technical difficulties with the beam line or machine.</p><p>Studies on photosystem II (PSII) -a 600KDa membrane protein complex.</p><p>We scanned 161 PSII crystals for diffraction quality, some up to 500µm in length. Unfortunately, none were of sufficient quality to significantly improve on our existing 3.5Å crystal structure. PSII crystals where the Ca ion in the catalytic centre had been replaced a Sr ion (Sr-PSII) were of lower quality than the native Ca-PSII crystals, and we were unable to obtain diffraction beyond about 6Å. These crystals were from new preparations of material and from different crystallization conditions. These results will enable us to perform further optimisation of our biochemical procedures and crystallization conditions in order to obtain better diffracting crystals.</p><p>We were able to conduct a fluorescence scan over the strontium K-edge on the Sr-PSII crystals. This confirmed the presence of strontium in the crystals. The determination of a Sr-PSII structure is a key aim for us, as it will enable the position of the calcium site within the water-slitting site to be unambiguously determined.</p><p>We used the ESRF Cryobench facility to investigate the effect of X-ray radiation on the spectral properties of the crystals. Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a crystal that has been irradiated. The path of the beam in the mother liquor is clear. This purple colour (which disappeared over time), probably represents the hydrated electron.</p><p>Fig 1 . A PSII crystal at 100K that has been exposed to X-rays. The path of the beam through the loop is visible as a purple line.</p><p>Despite the very high visible absorption of the crystals, it was possible to show the likely photoreduction of pheophytin (Fig 2 .) the primary physiological electron acceptor from the excited P680* donor. There is therefore a correlation between physiological function and chemical behaviour in the beam.</p><p>We measured the fluorescence response to excitation by a 440nm laser of a native PSII crystal and an X-ray exposed crystal (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The irradiation seemed to completely convert one fluorescing chlorophyll species to another. In addition several new fluorescence peaks were created, at 642nm and 546nm. These peaks are as yet unassigned, although it is likely that they are from some of the chromophores within PSII. The results need to be repeated but seem to provide an assay for damage/modifications occurring within PSII crystals on exposure to X-ray radiation. This interesting discovery will require a more rigorous analysis.</p><p>In summary, we scanned many crystals from different crystallization conditions for diffraction and obtained data which provides the basis for further optimisation experiments. We were also able to obtain novel spectroscopic results on these crystals. When combined with better diffraction data we will be able to provide chemical and structural pictures of PSII at different states of radiation damage and of the physiological reaction cycle. Fig 3. The effect of X-ray irradiation on the fluorescence spectrum of a photosystem II crystal. The unexposed crystal showed two fluorescence peaks at 685nm and 697nm, corresponding to chlorophyll a contained within the CP43 and CP47 subunits respectively. An X-ray exposed crystal showed a new peak at 707nm, corresponding to a red-shift in the chlorophyll spectrum and also new unassigned peaks at 642nm and 546nm.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig 2 .Fig 3 .</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Fig 2.
