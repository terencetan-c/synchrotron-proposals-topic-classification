<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have performed SAXS measurements to study the formation mechanism of CdSe semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) through the hot injection synthesis. There are few reports on the formation mechanism of NCs but either only via in/ex situ optical absorption spectroscopy data or with reaction setups not accurately reproducing the hot-injection conditions. In this experiments we have performed the synthesis of CdSe NCs in a custom made setup to reproduce exactly the same synthesis conditions used in the laboratory and, at the same time, probe the growing NCs in situ with a ms time resolution.</p><p>The synthesis of semiconductor NCs, or quantum dots, is typically performed with a hot-injection method. In this method, a solution of one of the two precursors is quickly injected in a thermally activated solution of the second precursor. Due to the harsh synthesis conditions (high temperatures, oxygen and water free atmosphere) and due to the very fast formation timescale (ms), it is very challenging to study the formation of these particles with synchrotron-based X-ray scattering techniques. For this reason there are only few reports on this kind of measurements, and in all of them the NCs are either already formed (static measurements) or they are produced in situ through the prior mixing of the precursors and their heat up in capillaries (i.e. in a different synthesis environment and not with a hot injection procedure). To perform this experiment in exactly the same conditions used in the lab, we developed a custom built setup to perform a hot injection synthesis while probing the sample with X-rays. For this purpose we designed a three neck flask with an indentation for the transmission of the X-rays, heated with a heating ribbon and connected to a remotely controlled liquid/powder injector (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). With this setup we studied the formation of CdSe NCs (spherical and platelet-like) through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments at a detector distance of 0.8m. For the nanoplatelet geometry, we performed three syntheses with different formation temperature and injecting our precursors at different recation times, while probing the reaction mixture with a time resolution of 1 s (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). From the evolution of the scattering pattern we can extract information about the formation mechanism of the nanoplatelets. In particular the preliminary analyses highlight the formation of semiconductor NCs in the early stages of the reaction, followed by the injection of the precursor (peak at 6 nm -1 ), which dissolved over time thus triggering the two dimensional growth (highlighted by the increased scattering at small q values). At very long reaction times (&gt;1350 s) we observe the appearance of structure factor peaks associated to the stacking of the nanoplatelets. Further analysis will be required in order to separate the scattering contributions of the NCs to the one of the nanoplatelets, thus allowing us to unravel the exact formation mechanism of the two dimensional CdSe nanoplatelets. Concerning the formation of the NCs, we performed several hot injection syntheses with different synthesis parameters (quantity of precursors, injection temperature, growth temperature) while probing the reaction mixture through SAXS with a time resolution as small as 0.122 s (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). From the evolution of the scattering pattern with reaction time, we observe the appearance of spherical form factor minima associated to the nucleation of the NCs, and their shift toward smaller q values over time, indicating growth. A preliminary fitting of the scattering patterns over time allowed us to extract the evolution of the concentration of the NCs in the reaction mixture, as well as of their radius and of their size distribution. Further analyses will be required to extract all the useful information necessary to develop a formation mechanism model. To summarize, we performed, for the first time, a study on the formation kinetics of NC systems with a hot injection method in situ, in real time and in experimental conditions similar to the ones used in the laboratory with time resolutions as high as 122 ms. Although the results deserve a more detailed and more quantitative analysis, preliminary considerations show that our experiments were successful in following the growth of the CdSe NCs and nanoplatelets. Further analysis are required to extract all the information from the scattering patterns and thus allow a complete reconstruction of the formation mechanism.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Experimental setup used in the experiments.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,33.95,79.45,161.55,215.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
