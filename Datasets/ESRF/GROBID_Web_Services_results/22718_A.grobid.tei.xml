<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Aim of the experiment is the structural characterization of GaAs layers grown on group IV semiconductor substrates. Such layers are of technological interest, because they would allow for a combination of III-V-optoelectronical elements and standard CMOS logic (data storage and procesing) on one device. In principle, Ge has a lattice paramter very close to that of GaAs (a Ge =5.657 Å, a GaAs =5.653 Å), and therefore is suited for the epitaxial growth of GaAs on Ge. However, the final aim for technological application will be the growth of GaAs on Si substrates. Due to the lattice mismatch of more than 4% between Si and GaAs, an intermediate layer (virtual substrate) to compensate this mismatch is required. As the growth of SiGe and Ge virtual substrates is increasingly important also for other applications, the use of such a strain-relaxed Ge buffer as virtual substrate for GaAs has been suggested.</p><p>We have investigated two samples, where GaAs has been deposited onto a buffer layer of pure Ge which was in turn deposited directly onto a Si (001) wafer, without the use of a intermediate graded SiGe buffer. A major problem in the epitaxial growth of III-V semiconductor on group IV layers is the occurrence of antiphase boundaries. I.e., growth will initially start either with the group III or the group V element with approximately the same probability. Hence growth may start with both elements in different domains, and upon coalescence of the domains, antiphase boundaries result. In order to avoid this effect, in the investigated samples the first monolayers of GaAs have been deposited in an atomic layer epitaxy mode. In this mode, Ga and As are deposited alternatingly, and hence the growth should start only with one element on the whole wafer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reciprocal space maps have been recorded around various reciprocal lattice points in order to obtain information on the strain status of both the Ge and the GaAs buffer.</head><p>From the diffuse scattering, information on the dislocations in the GaAs buffer, as well as on possibly still present anti-pahse boundaries shall be obtained. Due to the good lattice matching between Ge and GaAs, and because the Ge buffer is completely relaxed, as our invetigations showed, the GaAs and Ge signal are superimposed over each other around the strong relfections like (004) or (224). Using reflections which are weak for GaAs, but forbidden for Si or Ge, it is possible, however, to measure diffuse scattering only from the GaAs buffer. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows several reciprocal space maps around symmetric (002), ( <ref type="formula">004</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula">006</ref>), as well as around the asymmetric ( <ref type="formula">224</ref>) and (204) Bragg reflections. In order to be more sensitive to the topmost GaAs layer, diffraction in the grazing incidence configuration has been employed. Also here, reciprocal space maps have been recorded around the (400) reflection (strong reflection for GaAs and Ge) as well as around the (200) reflection (weak in GaAs, forbidden in Ge).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1. Reciprocal space maps of sample Ge14 around various Bragg reflections. The diffuse scattering around (002), (006) and (204) is only due to the GaAs layer, as this reflections are forbidden for Si and Ge.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,33.49,314.51,259.42,221.95" type="bitmap" /></figure>
