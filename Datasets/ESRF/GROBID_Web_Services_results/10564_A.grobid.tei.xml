<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report on experiment LS-900</head><p>We have tested the crystals of gelsolin (S4-6): actin complex in the beam under cryo-cooling conditions. The diffraction properties indicated that the crystals are intrinsically well ordered, the diffraction spots were observed up to 3.0 w resolution.The diffraction pattern was nevertheless weak due to the particular morphology of the crystals which appear to be thin needles with dimensions of 0.01x0.01x0.40 mm 3 . We therefore did not proceed with the data collection which would have resulted in data of poor quality, and would be a bad starting point for molecular replacement experiments. We hope to obtain access to the micro-focusing beam-line at ESRF.</p><p>We therefore collected a native dataset on spectrin-like repeats from a-actinin (R2R3) and on the complex of Burton's tyrosine kinase PH domainJP4 (wild type and E41K mutant).. The crystals of R2R3 belong to hexagonal space group P6122 with cell dimensions a = b = 59.711 c= 390.738 A and diffracted to 2.0 A resolution. The collected data are 88.8 % complete (58.8% in the last shell from 2.03 -2.0 A). The high resolution data set was collected on the Weissenberg detector, and a subsequent low-resolution pass was performed on the same crystal and data collected to 3.2 7 A with the CCD detector. 160533 reflections were collected, and merged to 26307 unique reflections with the overall Rmerge of 0.078 (0.396 in the last resolution shell). We would like to point out that the Weissengerg geometry was of crucial importance for us to collect diffraction data beyond 3.2 A resolution, because of the long dimension of the c-axis of the crystals. Detection of diffraction spots with standard equipment (CCD, image plate) resulted in non-resolvable spots beyond 3.0 -3.2 A resolution.</p><p>The crystals of BtkPH:IP4 belong to tetragonal space group 14*22 with cell dimensions a = b= 110.784 A, c = 215.600 w and diffracted to 2.1 A and 2.4 8, resolution for E41K mutant and wild type, respectively.</p></div>
