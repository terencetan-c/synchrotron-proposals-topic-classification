<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: GIXD and XRR reveal the molecular structures of the tear film lipid layer components and their mixtures</p><p>We conducted Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXD) and X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) experiments on synthetic tear film lipid layer (TFLL) components, representing all the main TFLL lipid species and their most relevant mixtures. The experiments were carried out using a sealed Langmuir trough with a Wilhelmy balance and thermostat bath at the beamline ID10-EH1. We used saline subphase in the trough and were able to study the film structures and dynamics of the TFLL lipids close to their physiologically relevant conditions, at two different temperatures (25° C and 30° C) and as a function of the surface pressure (between 4 to 40 mN/m).</p><p>The lipids studied included the pure samples of two O-acyl-omega-hydroxy fatty acids (OAHFA) representing different chain lengths (with long and very long chains), behenyl oleate (representing long chain wax ester), iso-methyl branched wax ester (iso-WE), iso-methyl branched cholesteryl ester (iso-CE) and long chain diester (DiE). These lipids are considered to represent the lipid types which are found in abundance in intact TFLL. In addition, carefully chosen mixtures of these components were characterized, including different ratios of iso-WE, iso-CE and OAHFAs and one mixture of the primary components mimicking closely the composition of the natural TFLL (OAHFA (5%) Iso-WE (47.5%) Iso-CE (47.5%)). Clear diffraction peaks were observed in the GIXD patterns of all the lipid samples studied when the surface pressure was above 4 mN/m. Thus, it can be concluded that all the primary TFLL lipids characterized in this study formed ordered, crystalline structures. Based on the changes of these peaks, structural differences as a function of the mixture composition, temperature and the surface pressure were determined. Based on the GIXD patterns, most of the TFLL lipids studied presented rectangular lattices with either NN or NNN tilt (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>), the exact phase depending on the surface pressure and temperature. This corresponds well to previous GIXD results on intact meibum and pure lipid monolayers found in the literature. The various TFLL lipids had various phase behaviors: it was observed that the lattice spacings were decreased as a function of increasing surface pressure in OAHFAs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), whereas there were no changes observed in iso-WE. These insights gleaned from the GIXD measurements on the lattice structure are combined and complemented with the analysis of the XRR data yielding the electron density profile and film thickness (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Thus, a detailed view on the molecular structure of the films is obtained.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: A comparison of the measured XRR curves for pure OAHFA, pure Iso-WE and a mixture of both. Distinct features are observed in each of the spectra: the pure OAHFA features correspond to a monolayer, whereas the pure iso-WE features correspond to multilayers.</p><p>Cholesteryl and wax esters are known to be the key components of the TFLL; as an example of this, lower CE/WE-ratios have been connected to e.g. the dry-eye-disease. Interestingly, a clear structural difference between the molecular organization of the pure iso-WE and iso-CE and any other lipids studied could be observed in our GIXD results. Based on the Debye rings observed in the GIXD patterns of the pure iso-CE, these lipid molecules formed 3D crystallites in the higher temperature studied (at 30°C) and at higher surface pressures (above 10 mN/m). However, in the mixtures, e.g. in the case where 10% OAHFA was mixed with iso-CE, similar kinds of very clear Debye rings were not observed. This might be connected to the TFLL function and the iso-CE's role in it.</p><p>Our results indicate that the lipid compositions and surface pressure play important roles in the behavior and function of the TFLL lipids. The structural results by GIXD and XRR will be combined with the surface properties determined by surface pressure, evaporation and Brewster angle microscopy. The full analysis of all the data is still on-going and the results will be published in two separate scientific articles (in preparation).</p><p>Based on the results of these primary TFLL components, we are now planning further studies, which will be approaching even closer composition of the native TFLL, i.e. the intact meibum composition by adding the phospholipids into the picture.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Experiment title: Mapping the Structure-Function Relationships of the Tear Film Lipid Layer by Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction on its central Lipid Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Kirsi Svedström* University of Helsinki Ryan Trevorah* University of Helsinki Mira Viljanen* University of Helsinki Tuomo Viitaja* University of Helsinki Henrik Stubb* University of Helsinki Julia Sevón* University of Helsinki Filip Ekholm University of Helsinki</figDesc></figure>
