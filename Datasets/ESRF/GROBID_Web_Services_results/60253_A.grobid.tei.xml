At ID03, we studied the stability of RuO2(110)/Ru( <ref type="formula">0001</ref>) samples (prepared in advance at JLU Giessen) under applied anodic potential pulses. In the first experiment, we utilized 0.5 M H2SO4 as electrolyte to run the O2 evolution reaction (OER). Despite common believe in RuO2(110) instability under the OER conditions, we did not observe any significant changes of its in-and out-of-plane crystallinity in the range of applied potentials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). Performed H scans revealed three components attributed to RuO2(110) (H1 = 0.726 ± 0.006), Ru(0001) (H2 = 0.998 ± 0.006) and a Ru powder ring (H3 = 0.870-0.930) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 a</ref>). The ratio between the components was found to be constant. Appearance of Ru powder rings was observed prior to the applied EC treatment and thus we could conclude that domains of polycrystalline Ru were initially present on the fresh crystal. The thickness of the RuO2(110) domains was derived from an analysis of the L scans and found to be constant throughout the experiment (1.3 ± 0.1 nm) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 b</ref>). This value is consistent with previously published data. We also analyzed XRRs and found that the roughness of the electrode was not largely affected by the applied anodic treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 c</ref>). Intensity fluctuations in the specular XRR region were found to be unsystematic and thus more likely to be originated from the extensive gas production or variation in the beam alignment.</p><p>292 288 284 280 276 b) C1s / RuO 2 (110) on Ru(0001) Ru 0 RuO 2 RuX C adv Intensity, a.u.

SEM measurements revealed significant pitting of the electrode surface (11.2 % of the total electrode area) caused by the applied electrochemical treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3 a</ref>). The average diameter of these features was determined to be 150 nm. However, based on the synchrotron data recorded at ID03, an impact of those features on the surface crystallinity was not observed. Chemical structure of the electrode was also preserved, as it can be seen from the XPS measurements showing presence of the peaks attributed to Ru 0 , In the second experiment, we utilized 0.5 M HCl as electrolyte to initiate simultaneous Cl2/O2 evolution reaction (CER/OER, respectively). Similar to the previous experiment, H scans revealed 3 components: RuO2(110) (H1 = 0.727 ± 0.005), Ru(0001) (H2 = 0.997 ± 0.005) and Ru powder ring (H3 = 0.884-0.931) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 a</ref>). Ru powder rings were also found on the untreated electrode and thus its appearance is not related to the applied electrochemical treatment. Starting from E = + 1.43 V, a reversible decrease of Ru(0001) intensity accompanied by a proportional reversible increase of RuO2(110) intensity was observed in H scans. The fact of reversibility of these changes and extensive CER expected at this potential range made us think that those changes are most likely attributed to Cl2 production rather than change in the electrode's crystallinity. The size of RuO2(110) domains was derived from an analysis of the L scans and found to be constant throughout the experiment (1.2 ± 0.1 nm), similar to the previous experiment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 b</ref>). However, we also observed the disturbance of the L = 2.7 peak at the last two potentials (E = + 1.65 V and E = + 0.8 V (recorded in H2O)). This is most likely related to an overlap with an artefact line appearing at the same region of 2D detector as the signal from RuO2(110) appears (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5 a</ref>). Also, it can be attributed to a small electrolyte leak which we noticed at the end of the experiment. This leak yielded contamination of the sample surface with elements of the contact plate, including Cu, Zn, Sn and also Si from the sealings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5 b</ref>). We also analyzed XRRs and found that roughness of the electrode was not largely affected by applied anodic treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4 c</ref>). Intensity fluctuations in specular XRR region were found to be unsystematic and thus more likely to be originated from the extensive gas production or variation in the beam alignment. SEM measurements of the spent RuO2(110)/Ru(0001) revealed similar pitting of the electrode surface (13.0 % of the electrode area) caused by the applied electrochemical treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6 a</ref>). However, the average diameter of these features appeared to be higher (220 nm) compared to the previous experiment (being 150 nm). Despite the surface pitting, we did not observe irreversible changes in crystalline structure of RuO2( <ref type="formula">110</ref>) by any of the synchrotron techniques utilized at ID03. Chemical structure of the electrode -as far as it concerns Ru speciation -was found to be similar to the previous sample, as it can be seen from the XPS measurements showing presence of the same peaks attributed to Ru 0 , RuO2 and RuX (most likely, Ru(OH)3, hydrated form) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6 b</ref>). CV measurements conducted in hanging meniscus mode did not show presence of Ru metal on the electrode surface and thus Ru powder ring signal observed in H scans can rather be attributed to the rim of the crystal (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6 c</ref>). Moreover, it was found that potential cycling in the studied potential window leads to appearance of 2 reduction peaks most likely attributed to reduction of Cl2 (E = + 1.36 V) and other Cl species strongly bound to RuO2 (E = + 1.15 V). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
