<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>The protein crystallography laboratory at the University of Tromsø has been regular user of ESRF for many years. Over the years this has resulted in more than 40 publications and a considerable number of PhDs and MScs. The Norwegian Structural Biology Centre (NORSTRUCT) is administrated by the Department of Chemistry at the University of Tromsø, and was established in 2002 through a national initiative in functional genomics in Norway. The aim of this initiative is the establishment of a structural biology centre of high international standard for determination and analysis of the 3D-structures of biologically active macromolecules. In addition to taking part in projects nationwide as an external collaborator, NORSTRUCT has been given the opportunity to initiate and develop internal projects at the centre. Our involvement in external projects range from consultancy to full scale structure determination and structure-function analysis, including hosting project workers for training and providing access to facilities.</p><p>Internal projects at NORSTRUCT focus on proteins expressed by the fish pathogenic bacteria Vibrio salmonicida and enzymes involved in the defence systems of Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon, and with a structural genomics approach to virulence factors and defence molecules of the model organisms. "Structural genomics studies of Vibrio salmonicida", is one part of a more comprehensive project on this psychrophilic and pathogenic bacteria, also including genome sequencing and cellular/functional studies. The structural part of the project is divided into sub-groups based on functional aspects of the proteins. A) "Structurefunction relation studies of proteins involved in oxidative stress", B) "Structure-function relation studies of nucleases", C) "Structure-function studies of DNA repair proteins", D) "Structure-function studies of hypothetical proteins", and E) "Structure determination of virulence factors expressed by V. salmonicida". External projects originate both in the academic society in Norway and in the biotecnology industry, and include nucleases and DNA binding proteins, phosphatases, isocitrate dehydrogenases and several other proteins of academic and commercial interest. The majority of the projects are the subject of structure-function-relation studies, where one seeks to increase the the knowledge about the relationship between structure and biophysical properties such as specificity, efficiency and stability. Succeding structure determination several of the proteins will be the target of redesign of one or more such properties.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biological adaptation to extreme temperatures</head><p>Icocitrate dehydrogenase from Pyrococcus furiosus (IDH1) and Desulfotalea psychrophila (IDH6) can be crystallized from 0.4 M NH 4 HPO 4 and 50 mM MgSO 4 (IDH1) and 1.7M ammonium sulfate, 0.1M Tris pH7.4 and 0.1 M Mg 2 SO 4 (IDH6). Both proteins give plate like crystals up to 0.4 x 0.5 x 0.05 mm 3 . Data were collected on native IDH1, native IDH6, IDH1 with NAD cofactor and IDH6 with isocitrate substrate. The best native IDH1 diffracted to 2.5 Å and belonged to space group C2 with cell parameters of 99.4 x 58.0 x 79.6 mm 3 , β=113.2. R sym was 8%, completeness was 95.2% and I/σI was 6.4. The structure has been solved by molecular replacement to an R-factor of 29.4% (R-free=34%). The protein is now subjected to structural analysis. IDH1 crystals were also soaked with NAD and data was collected. The crystals diffracted up to 2.7 Å. The data could be indexed to a space group isomorphous to the native crystals, but could not be processed. Native IDH6 diffracted to 1.75Å, and belong to the triclinic space group with cell parameters of 59.34 x 73.28 x 126.41, α=98.90, β=98.98, γ=113.876. R sym was 4.7%, I/σI was 9.9 and completeness 86.3%. The structure has been solved with molecular replacement, identifying three molecules in the asymmetric unit.</p><p>Model building and refinement is in progress. IDH6 was cocrystallized with substrate (isocitrate). The crystal morphology changed, and the crystals diffracted to 2.4 Å. IDH6 with isocitrate belong to space group C2221 with cell parameters of 58.49 x 121.29 x 272.25 mm 3 . We believe the structure is solved by molecular replacement, identifying two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Further analysis of this structure is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure studies of Receptor for Activated C-Kinase (RACK 1)</head><p>The crystals of this protein did not diffract.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Crystallographic studies of the Antarctic alkaline phosphatase TAB5</head><p>Several crystals were tried and one crystal diffracting to 2.0 Å was found. SAD data was colledted close to the Zn edge. Space group is P222 with cell parameters of 55.88 x 174.30 x 70.14 mm 3 . R sym was 16.5%, I/σI was 4.3, completeness and anomalous completeness were 99.9% and multiplicity was 15. Attempts to phase the protein is in progress.</p></div>
