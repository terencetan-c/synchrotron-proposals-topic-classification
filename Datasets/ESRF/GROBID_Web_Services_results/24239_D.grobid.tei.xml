<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M. Knossow, B. Gigant and F. Eghian (1 shift): Structural study of complexes of Tubulin with drugs</head><p>Tubulin is the basic building block of microtubules, one of the key components of the cytoskeleton. In particular, and as an example, during cell division microtubules form the mitotic spindle. Tubulin, either free or microtubule-polymerized, is therefore one of the best characterized targets of anticancer drugs. We have obtained crystals of tubulin in complex with the stathmin-like domain of the neural protein RB3. The structure was solved initially by molecular replacement using an electron microscopy model of tubulin, and subsequently by the SAD method using a selenomethionine derivative of RB3 (see previous reports). The structure has allowed us to determine the binding site of cocristallized ligands of the colchicine binding site of tubulin (manuscript in preparation). The experiment performed at ESRF on ID14eh4 on july 3 /4 were devoted to characterize the binding mode of other ligands of tubulin, with soaked crystals. The soaking technique was previously used succesfully with vinblastine (refinement in progress). Three different ligands were tested and 3 datasets collected. For one ligand, the electron density maps are devoided of specific signal. The last two ligands are thought to bind to the vinblastine site of tubulin. In these cases, data were collected to 4.3 and 4.4 Å resolution. The site of the second ligand (weak signal) does not appear to overlap with the vinblastine site, whereas the site of the third one overlaps partially with this site; in this case data should be collected to higher resolution to confirm our finding and allow meaningful refinement.</p></div>

Spacegroup P2 1 2 1 2 1 a=315A; b=112A; c=192A. Resolution 4.4A. Completion 94.1% Rsym=13,4% DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that catalyze changes in the topological state of DNA molecules during biological processes as important as replication, transcription and DNA repair. We are interested in DNA topoisomerase VI produced by the archaebacteria S. shibatae. Strikingly, this bacterial protein is the target of different drugs currently used in cancer treatment. We have collected a 4.4A dataset from crystals of DNA topoisomerase VI grown in the presence of a cofactor. Molecular replacement trials are currently carried out to try to solve the structure.</p><p>2)YHR029c (target 48). Spacegroup P4 3 2 1 2 a=b=81A; c=98A. Resolution 2A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Completion 100% Rsym=6%</head><p>This orf codes for a protein, which belongs to the Phzf family involved in the synthesis of the broad spectrum antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). Phzf is involved in dimerization of two 2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-anthranilic acid molecules to create PCA in P. Fluorescens. It is is similar to 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthases of solanaceous plants and distantly related to diaminopimelate epimerases. We have collected a 3 wavelength MAD SeMet dataset which allowed the resolution of the structure to 2.0A resolution. This protein composed of 294 amino acids is composed of 2 structural domain that have the same fold, i.e. a β-barrel with an α-helix running inside the barrel.</p><p>3) YIR029w (target 205) Spacegroup P3 2 21 a= b=109A; c=190A. Resolution 2.6A. Completion 100% Rsym=6.7% This orf codes for an allantoicase, an enzyme associated with the purine metabolism. It breaks down allantoin into glyoxylate and urea and thus is involved in the use of purine as a secondary source of nitrogen. We have collected a 3 wavelength MAD SeMet dataset to 2.6A resolution but we were not able to solve the structure of this protein from these data.</p></div>		</body>
