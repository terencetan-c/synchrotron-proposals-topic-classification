<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Adsorption at interfaces is critical for many processes in nature, e. g. formation of gas hydrates, catalysis, enzymatic reactions, or industrial applications. The formation of an adsorption layer enhances the gas offer significantly and is thus of importance for transport and exchange processes at membranes and interfaces in nature. Supercritical adsorption, however, is far less understood, though this phenomenon has been known for some time now and has tremendous importance in industrial applications like high pressure gas storage systems, Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC), and polymer processing. In the last years, interfaces have also been investigated with regard to their relevance to hydrate formation. The differentiation between effects originating from hydrate formation and adsorption is of high importance, and the role of supercritical gases in this context remains unclear.</p><p>Experiments were performed at the liquid sample setup of the high energy beamline ID15A at a photon energy of 69.9 keV. A custom made stainless steel sample cell with 2 mm thick aluminum windows and an inner radius of 10 cm was used, similar to the one in experiment SI-2164. The sample environment was able to sustain pressures up to 100 bar. The temperature was controlled via a heating foil and a water cooling circuit and monitored by two Pt100 temperature sensors. A Teflon ring in the cell provided a well-controlled meniscus of the liquid phase. We placed ~ 25 ml of ultrapure water or glycerol into the sample cell. The cell was then closed and flushed with CO 2 or methane.</p><p>After sample alignment, a reference reflectivity curve was measured. The pressure was increased in steps between 1 bar and 10 bar and a reflectivity measurement was performed at each pressure step.</p><p>The structure of glycerol and water surfaces in the presence of CO 2 and methane was investigated at various pressures. Different reflectivity series were recorded. The glycerolmethane system was studied at 4.5°C and 21°C, up to pressures of about 90 bar. The graphs below show that the structure of the interface is visibly modified with increasing methane pressure. Even if methane is in a supercritical state, a (thin) layer formation can be observed with increasing pressure.</p><p>The glycerol -CO 2 systems, measured at temperatures of 29.5°C (below the critical temperature) and 34°C (above the critical temperature), is shown in the graphs below. The applied pressure of the gas phase was limited by the bottle pressure of 60 bar. At 29.5°C, CO 2 is subcritical and thus the formation of a thin adsorption layer was expected and observed, see Figure below. The resulting reflectivity curves look similar at both temperatures. The latter two data subsets show more scatter than the methane data. This scattering is owed to the decreased glycerol viscosity at 30°C and thus increased sensitivity to vibrations, see also the discussion below.</p><p>A more detailed data analysis is going on, determining the exact shape of the interface including roughness and layer thickness of these systems. As a preliminary result, a layer formation at the liquid surface can be observed even in the case of supercritical gases.</p><p>We also measured reflectivity curves at the watergas interface for both gases (not shown). Qualitatively, the curves show the same trends as in the graphs above. However, these data sets are harder to analyze. The viscosity of water is significantly lower than the viscosity of glycerol, so that the system is more sensitive to vibrations. The water data sets show strong scattering, which we attribute to vibrations from the nearby highway. We resolved the vibration problem in the subsequent beamtime (November 2011) by using a damping table. In that way, we obtained very smooth curves, comparable to the glycerol system at lower temperatures.</p><p>In conclusion, we observed a modification of the interfacial structure of the glycerolmethane interface with increasing pressure in the supercritical phase. A thin layer was adsorbed to the glycerol phase. The use of a glycerol substrate eliminates the possibility of hydrate formation, so that a possible formation of hydrate clusters is excluded. We should also mention that we did not observe hydrate formation with the water substrate at conditions of hydrate stability. A more detailed data treatment is going on and will reveal the exact pressure dependencies of the layer electron density profile in the supercritical state.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):</figDesc></figure>
