<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In-situ strain analysis of heterogeneous bulk metallic glasses: effect of interfaces </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of our experiments was to characterize the structure of heterogeneous bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) in order to understand their enhanced room-temperature tensile ductility compared to the corresponding homogeneous counterparts. To achieve this aim, we studied in-situ the strain fields created within and at the interfaces between the structurally heterogeneous regions during mechanical loading of an imprinted Zr 52.5 Ti 5 Cu 18 Ni 14.5 Al 10 BMG. Imprinting creates structural heterogeneities with controlled size and morphology, a prerequisite for accurately characterize the elasto-plastic behavior of heterogeneous BMGs.</p><p>The heterogeneous areas in the imprinted glass are expected to exhibit different elastic properties, which, as a result of the elastic mismatch arising at the interfaces between elastically-different materials (i.e. the heterogeneities), may generate a macroscopic nonuniform stress distribution during mechanical loading, triggering the formation of shear bands and improving the ductility. To clarify this aspect, we synthesized samples with different imprinting angles α = 0, 45 and 90° and analyzed the strain across the samples at increasing loads: the samples were firstly investigated at zero load, to have the initial value for the strain calculation, and subsequently in-situ during loading at 50, 100, 200 and 300 N. An as-cast specimen was also investigated to compare the results with the parent homogeneous material. Mechanical deformation of the samples was carried out at room temperature under tensile loading using the tensile rig available at ID11 and operating at a strain rate of 1×10 -4 . The structure after unloading was studied as well in order to extract information on the structural changes without the effect of the elastic contribution. For each loading step, diffraction patterns were collected at every 3 µm along the transverse direction, covering a line of about 2 mm. In the present experiment, we used a beam size of 2×3 µm 2 , small enough to extract structural information exclusively from the different heterogeneous areas, which have typical length scale of 200-300 µm, and more importantly from the interface between these regions.</p><p>The two-dimensional patterns were integrated in 10° azimuthal slices between 0 and 360° using the Fit2D program to give the XRD intensity distributions I(Q,η i ) as a function of the scattering vector Q for the azimuthal angle η j (j = 10…360°). In order to have a preliminary evaluation of the results, the strain ε induced in the samples during loading was determined in reciprocal space through the shift of the main diffraction peak (Q 1 ) as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">load load Q Q Q / ) ( 0 - = ε</formula><p>, where Q load is the peak position of the mechanically-loaded material and Q 0 of the initial zeroload condition. The three components of the strain tensor (tangential ε yy , axial ε zz and in-plane shear ε yz ) for each point scanned were determined according to the method described in Poulsen et al. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> by fitting the angular variation of the peak shifts.</p><p>As a typical example of the data obtained in reciprocal space, the figure below shows the strain maps of the ε xx and ε yy components of the strain tensor as a function of the applied load evaluated from the variation of Q 1 . The data refer to an imprinted specimen with α = 90°.</p><p>The results reveal that the strain is heterogeneously distributed in the different regions. The strain distribution becomes progressively more heterogeneous with increasing the load, with significant variation at the interfaces. The elastic constants also change dramatically:</p><p>Young´s modulus and Poisson´s ratio increase from E = 92 GPa and ν = 0.30 for the as-cast material to E = 115 GPa and ν = 0.35 for the heterogeneous imprinted glass. These results are necessarily preliminary and work is ongoing to obtain a complete picture of the strain distribution in real space along with the elastic constants for the different atomic shells, which we expect to lead to a significant leap forward in the understanding of the intrinsic properties of metallic glasses and to generate a comprehensive picture of the effect of structural heterogeneities on the mechanical behavior of BMGs.</p><p>All in all, we consider these measurements to have been a large success and we have, to a great degree, accomplished our goals outlined in the proposal. No experimental difficulties were encountered and the scientific support from the local contact was outstanding.</p><p>[1] H.F. <ref type="bibr">Poulsen et al., Nature Mater. 4, 33 (2005)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Sergio Scudino*, IFW Dresden Helmholtzstrasse 20, 01069 Dresden, Germany Ivan Kaban*, IFW Dresden Helmholtzstrasse 20, 01069 Dresden, Germany</figDesc></figure>
