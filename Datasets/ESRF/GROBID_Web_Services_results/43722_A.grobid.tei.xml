<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of this project was to examine the effect of both chlorine and sulphur poisoning processes on a series of industrial sized CuZnO methanol synthesis and water gas shift production catalysts. Utilizing the high energy X-rays of ID15 allows us to penetrate the large sample environment whilst still maintaining a high quality signal and very fast measurement speeds. Using these advantages the aim was to be able to reconstruct 2 and 3D tomographic diffraction and fluorescence images from the sample. The experiment was largely successful and large amount of high quality diffraction data was recorded which has now been reconstructed into 'slices' of the catalyst sample. Some examples of this are given in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> where we show how for a single pellet exposed to 200 ppm sulphur poisoning in the gas stream (performed offline and followed by a passivation procedure) results in a high concentration of metal oxide and metallic species on the inside of the pellet and the production of numerous poison species on the outside of the pellet. From these data and on-going additional laboratory experiments we should be able to begin to understand the poisoning processes in these full size, industrially relevant materials and we hope to produce a peer reviewed publication on this work as the project proceed in 2011.</p><p>Unfortunately, whilst the diffraction imaging has proved very successful, the Compton florescence mapping of the sample was not as successful as we have found that the density of the samples results in strong self-reabsorption making it very difficult to reconstruct the images correctly. In addition we note that the work to process the data for PDF is on-going, however the quality of the data for the time resolution required may still be too low, something which can be resolved in the future with the recent addition of the tranforcator mirrors on the beam line (allowing more flux for the same spatial and time resolution). </p></div>			</div>
