<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>-Overview:</p><p>We acquired movies of recombinant vaults from Mus musculus in gold grids using the FEI Titan Krios electron microscope in counting mode with EPU at x130000 (pixel size of 1.067 Å/pixel). We used an electron dose of 6.4 electrons/pixel/second and each movie contains 30 frames recorded in 6 seconds. The whole dataset has 5039 movies.</p><p>-Quality of data:</p><p>The movies collected present a high heterogenity in the particle distribution, showing regions completely crowded of particles and regions with just very few particles. Also the particle itself presents structural heterogenity due to the presence of half-and full-particles or opening intermediates in the same area. These facts, joined to the big size of the particle (700 Å), limit the number of particles available per movie (FIGURE <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>The quality of the images is considerably high, reaching the 2.8 Å resolution in the CTF estimation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>-Status and progress of evaluation A total of 128657 particles were automatically picked with 700 x 700 box size in pixel and extracted with a pixel size of 1.07 Å. All particles were subjected to two-dimensional and three-dimensional classification using RELION 2.1. 17924 particles were selected and refined applying C1 symmetry. To enhance signal, the mask is generated from cryoEM data to focus the refinement in the vault region. Following "gold standard" refinement protocol, the current reconstructed map has been obtained to 8.4 Å of resolution. At this resolution we are not able to determine the structure of each monomer in the cap region and we can not apply any symmetry.</p><p>At this point we decide to make the localized three-dimensional reconstruction of the cap region of the vault, using the method described by Ilca et al., 2015. After determining the particle orientations, the cap regions were extracted and treated as single particles. The number of particles were duplicated and subjected to re-alignment and refinement but the reconstruction obtained did not improve the quality of the map.</p><p>In one of the first 3D classifications, we obtained one class comprised 7539 half-vault particles picked and extracted using relion. All these particles where subjected to two dimensional (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and three dimensional classification and 7515 particles were selected and refined using C1 symmetry. Following "gold standard" refinement protocol, the current reconstructed map (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) has been obtained to 7.9 Å of resolution.</p><p>-Results Unfortunately we have not been able to obtain a map of the half vault with sufficient quality to discern the readjustments of symmetry in the cap region. We have tried all the different methods that are available in the processing of the data, but it has not improved the quality of the maps in this region. However, we have obtained for the first time the structure of individual half vaults, showing surprising characteristics: the circular shape of the waist present in the whole particle is broken as a consequence of half vault diassembly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Now we have written a draft including this structure among other experiments, that are in concordance with a new suggested vault-aperture mechanism. This article will be submitted in the next months. But if we will be able to obtain more particles to calculate this model we could arise to higher resolution, obtaining more details about the structural changes produce in the aperture of the particle. Taking into account the CTF estimation of our movies, we have information until 3.4 Å of resolution.</p><p>We are working in a mutant of the Major vault protein that generates , mostly, half-vaults in solution. We consider that just collecting another dataset like this one, but with this new mutant vaults, we will have enough particles to obtain a reconstraction near atomic resolution.
