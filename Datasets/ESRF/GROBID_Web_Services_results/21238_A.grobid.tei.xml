<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>High pressure experiments were carried out in a diamond anvil cell on several samples of alkali and alkaline earth metal subnitrides and suboxides using the beam line ID09 (λ = 0.416 Å). Observed structural changes under pressure, deduced from Rietveld refinement of the collected diffraction data, provided an experimental tool to probe a unique combination of metallic and ionic bonding, which co-exist in these compounds. Simultaneous presence of anions (O 2-and N 3-) and nearly free electrons results in a spacial separation of ionic and metallic regions. This, in turn, often leads to low-dimensional anisotropic crystal structures. Furthermore, electrostatic repulsion between the anions and the remaining valence electrons leads to rather open structures, susceptible to application of external pressure. Below we present the results of high pressure investigations on alkaline earth subnitrides and related compounds.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The most comprehensive set of data was obtained for the Ae 2 N (Ae = alkaline earth metal, that is Ca, Sr, or Ba) family of isostructural compounds. These subnitrides, which can be formally described as (Ae 2+ ) 2 N 3-•e - in ionic formalism, have strongly anisotropic two-dimensional structure held together by both ionic and metallic bonding. While the 2D Ae 2 N layers are held together by ionic bonding between the Ae 2+ and N 3- ions, the bonding between the neighboring Ae 2 N layers can be viewed as metallic due to the remaining valence electron per formula unit. This bonding situation is presented schematically on the right using rhombohedral Ba 2 N as an example: Such model description of the Ae 2 N compounds suggests anisotropic compressibility due to the presence of alternating ionic (hard) and metallic (soft) layers in the crystal structures. This was confirmed by the results of Rietveld refinement of the collected diffraction data. Moreover, several phase transitions were observed in Ba 2 N. In the first phase transition at 2GPa merely the mutual orientation of the Ba 2 N layers changes from the anti-CdCl 2 -type stacking in Ba 2 N-I to the anti-CdI 2 -type arrangement in Ba 2 N-II. It is clear in the series of powder diffraction patterns below that the 003 peak of the space group R-3m transforms into the 001 peak of the space group P-3m1; these peaks correspond to the separation between the adjacent Ba 2 N layers: Further increase of the pressure induced at first another phase transition at 6 GPa to a defect cubic anti-Th 3 P 4type phase in the space group I-43d (Ba 2 N-III), followed by a transition at 8GPa to Ba 2 N-IV with a yet unknown structure, which, according to the powder diffraction pattern, is likely to be a distorted variant of the cubic Ba 2 N-III phase. The last observed Ba 2 N-IV phase appears to be stable up to 40 GPa.</p><p>The behavior of Ca 2 N and Sr 2 N follows that of Ba 2 N: analogous anisotropic compressibility is observed, with the c-direction being softer as the ab-directions, and with a larger compressibility of the metallic region compared to the ionic region, based on Rietveld refinement. However, only one phase transition was observed for each compound in the 0-40 GPa range. In both cases the high-pressure phase appears to be isostructural to the Ba 2 N-IV phase. The transitions take place at ca. 12 GPa for both Ca 2 N and Sr 2 N.</p><p>Two further compounds, related to the layered Ae 2 N subnitrides, were also investigated: ionic nitride hydrides Ca 2 NH and Ba 2 NH. Their high pressure behavior is important for a comparison with the subnitrides because the remaining valence electron of metallic (Ae 2+ ) 2 N 3-•e -is now bound as hydride anion in purely ionic (Ae 2+ ) 2 N 3-H -. Moreover, the arrangement of barium and nitrogen atoms in Ba 2 NH is practically the same as that in Ba 2 N, with the hydrogen atoms being between the 2D-Ba 2 N layers.</p><p>Cubic Ca 2 NH (Fd-3m) was found to transform into a rhombohedral structure (isotypic to Ba 2 NH at ambient pressure) at ca. 2 GPa. A typical result of Rietveld refinement is shown on the right. Ba 2 NH, on the other hand, turned out to have two phase transitions at ca. 6 and 13 GPa, though the crystal structure of the two new phases could not yet be solved.</p><p>The up to know obtained structural results on the Ae 2 N and Ae 2 NH compounds are being prepared for publishing.</p></div>		</body>
