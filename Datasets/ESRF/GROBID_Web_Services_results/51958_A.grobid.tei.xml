<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1 Introduction 99 Technetium is a 𝛽-emitting fission product primarily produced in nuclear reactors by the fission of 235 U and 239 Pu. Due to its high fission yield, long half-life (𝑡 1/2 ∼ 2.1 × 10 5 y) and redox-sensitive character, a reliable prediction of the chemical behaviour of technetium is necessary for the long-term safety assessment of nuclear waste repositories. In the case of repositories in salt-rock formations, the boundary conditions may potentially include saturated NaCl and MgCl 2 brines with salt concentrations above ∼ 5 M and ∼ 4.5 M, respectively. Technetium is also a relevant contaminant associated with sites for nuclear fuel reprocessing or plutonium production. Among the latter, the Hanford site (Washington State, USA) probably represents the largest remediation effort in the United States. In this site, Tc is mainly found as soluble species in the supernatant of underground storage tanks, which mostly consist of concentrated aqueous solutions of sodium nitrate/nitrite salts and sodium hydroxide <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>.</p><p>The chemical behaviour of radionuclides in concentrated salt brines can significantly differ from observations made in dilute solutions. Strong interaction processes between dissolved radionuclide species and the main background electrolyte ions can importantly modify the stability of charged species at elevated ionic strength. In some cases, the formation of new aquatic species and complexes unknown in dilute systems takes place in concentrated solutions, as recently reported for An(III/IV/V) in concentrated CaCl 2 brines <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Hence, the chemical behaviour and mobility of radionuclides under high ionic strength conditions cannot be simply extrapolated from dilute systems but need to be investigated for particular saline systems.</p><p>The mobility of Tc is strongly dependent on its oxidation state. Although several oxidation states of Tc are reported in the literature (ranging from +II to +VII) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Tc(VII) and Tc(IV) are the prevailing long-term stable redox states in the absence of any complexing ligand other than water under non reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. Heptavalent Tc exists as highly soluble and mobile pertechnetate anion (TcO 4 -), whereas Tc(IV) forms sparingly soluble hydrous oxides (TcO 2 ⋅ xH 2 O(s)). Due to the very different mobility and chemical characteristics of both oxidation states, an appropriate knowledge of the redox chemistry of Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) and Tc(IV) solubility/sorption processes is of special relevance in the context of radioactive waste disposal, as well as in the assessment of Tc behaviour in contaminated sites.</p><p>The redox transformations of Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) in the presence of different reducing systems were previously assessed in a number of experimental studies mostly in low ionic strength systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Owunwanne et al. (1977)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Warwick et al. (2007)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> used Sn(II) to study the reduction of Tc(VII) under highly acidic (pH &lt; 2) and hyperalkaline (pH &gt; 13.3) conditions, respectively. A fast and complete reduction of Tc(VII) was observed in both cases.</p><p>Hess et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> obtained a well-defined TcO 2 ⋅ xH 2 O solid phase by reducing Tc(VII) with Na 2 S 2 O 4 . The resulting Tc(IV) solid phase was used in undersaturation solubility experiments under saline (≤ 5.0 M NaCl) and acidic (≤ 6.0 M HCl) conditions. Based on their solubility and spectroscopic (UV-VIS/NIR, EXAFS) data, the authors derived comprehensive thermodynamic and activity models for Tc(IV) valid up to pH c ∼ 7. <ref type="bibr">Cui et al. (1996a)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> reported a kinetically hindered reduction of Tc(VII) to Tc(IV) in the presence of aqueous Fe(II), whereas Fe(II) precipitated or sorbed on the vessel walls led to a rapid reduction of Tc(VII) at pH &gt; 7.5. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Zachara et al. (2007)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> also studied the reduction of Tc(VII) in the presence of Fe(II)(aq) under near-neutral pH conditions (6 ≤ pH ≤ 8). In contrast to Cui and co-workers, the authors observed the reduction of Tc(VII) at pH ≥ 6.8, although reduction kinetics were strongly dependent on pH. The role of Fe solid phases in the reduction of Tc(VII) has been intensively studied within the last decades.</p><p>Among Fe phases, magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) is often considered as one of the most relevant corrosion product of steel forming under the strongly reducing conditions expected in underground repositories for nuclear waste disposal. <ref type="bibr">Cui et al. (1996b)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> studied the uptake of Tc by mag-netite in the presence of synthetic ground water. The authors assessed the effect of ionic strength and pH (7.8-9.5), investigated the rate of the sorption reaction, and concluded that the uptake was controlled by a ligand exchange mechanism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Geraedts et al. (2002)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Maes et al.

The authors concluded that TcO 2 ⋅ xH 2 O(s) formed in this system, and suggested that Tc(IV) polymers or colloids were responsible for the observed increase in solubility (∼ 10 -6 M). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wharton et al. (2000)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> studied the coprecipitation of Tc(VII) and Tc(IV) with mackinawite (FeS) and characterized the resulting solid phases by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Tc was immobilized as a Tc IV S 2 -like phase regardless of the initial oxidation state of Tc. Similar observations were reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Livens et al. (2004)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, who investigated the interaction between Tc and mackinawite using both +VII and +IV as initial redox state of Tc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Liu et al. (2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> performed comprehensive immobilization experiments with Tc in the presence of mackinawite. The authors assessed the effect of ionic strength (≤ 1.0 M NaCl) and pH (6.1-9.0) on the uptake of Tc, and observed a strong pH-dependence and the increase of the uptake rate with increasing ionic strength.</p><p>In contrast to Livens and co-workers, TcO 2 -like instead of TcS 2 -like phases were reported to form on the surface of mackinawite. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Llorens et al. (2008)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> coprecipitated Tc(VII) with siderite (FeCO 3 ), an Fe(II) solid phase forming in the presence of carbonate-rich groundwaters. The reduction of Tc(VII) and incorporation of Tc(IV) into the structure of siderite were confirmed by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Peretyazhko et al. (2012)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> studied the reduction of Tc by reactive ferrous iron forming in naturally anoxic, redox transition zone sediments from the Hanford site. A number of Fe(II) minerals were identified in the sediments, including Fe(II)-phyllosilicates, pyrite, magnetite and siderite.</p><p>The authors observed TcO 2 ⋅ xH 2 O-like phases regardless of Fe(II) mineralogy or reduction rate.</p><p>Recently, Kobayashi and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> systematically assessed the reliability of 𝐸 h -pH measurements and reaction kinetics to explain the redox behaviour of Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) in dilute solutions (0.1 M NaCl) in the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous reducing systems. The authors compared their experimental data with available thermodynamic predictions for Tc <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and reported an experimental borderline for In heterogeneous systems (presence of mineral phases), the reduction of Tc(VII) occurred only in the presence of magnetite, mackinawite and siderite phases.</p><p>In spite of the large number of experimental studies focussing on Tc redox reactions, the understanding of Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) redox processes and Tc(IV) uptake by Fe minerals is mostly limited to dilute aqueous systems, and investigations addressing Tc redox chemistry in concentrated salt brine systems remain very scarce. In this work, the redox behaviour of Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) couple was investigated in NaCl (0.5 M and 5.0 M) and MgCl 2 (0.25 M, 2.0 M and 4.5 M) solutions. The reduction of Tc(VII) to Tc(IV) was assessed in the presence of different reducing systems, e.g. Na 2 S 2 O 4 , Sn(II), Fe(II)/Fe(III), Fe powder, magnetite, mackinawite and siderite. The results are systematised according to the experimental 𝐸 h and pH values of the solution/suspension, the measured Tc concentration and redox state and compared to thermodynamic calculations (using SIT (Specific Ion Interaction Theory) or Pitzer ion interaction models for ionic strength corrections). XANES was used to characterize the redox state of Tc sorbed by magnetite, mackinawite and siderite in concentrated brine solutions. Using a similar experimental and conceptual approach, the studies reported here extend the study published by <ref type="bibr">Kobayashi et al.</ref> to other electrolyte systems and high ionic strength conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Thermodynamic background</head><p>The thermochemical database project of the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA-TDB) comprises the most comprehensive selection of thermodynamic data currently available for actinides and fission products. Technetium was initially reviewed in the volume 3 of the NEA-TDB series <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, although the thermodynamic selection was later revisited in the update volume by Guillaumont and co-authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The outcome is a critically reviewed selection of Tc thermodynamic data, rather complete for Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) redox reactions and Tc(IV) hydrolysis, solubility and carbonate complexation. The data selection is limited or non-existent for other potentially relevant ligands such as chloride, phosphate or sulphate. No ion interaction coefficients are selected for ionic species of Tc, thus limiting the applicability of the selected thermodynamic data to diluted systems where no specific ion interaction must be considered.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>  species (not currently selected in the NEA-TDB) have been reported to form under very acidic and reducing conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.

The blue solid line (A) in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> corresponds to the thermodynamic borderline for Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) calculated at 𝐼 = 0 according to reaction (1) and represents 50% Tc(VII) and 50% Tc(IV) redox state distribution. Note that this borderline depends both upon ionic strength and total Tc concentration, the later held constant at [Tc] 0 = 1 × 10  clearly indicates that a stabilization of Tc(IV) relative to Tc(VII) is expected with increasing ionic strength. Only minor differences (≤ 0.3 pe-units) are observed between Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) borderlines calculated by SIT and Pitzer, indicating the validity of the SIT also in the extremely high saline conditions of this study. </p></div>

The values of pH c = pH exp + 𝐴 c were calculated from the operational "measured" pH exp using empirical corrections factors (𝐴 c ), which entail both the liquid junction potential and the activity coefficient of H + . 𝐴 c values determined as a function of NaCl and MgCl 2 concentration are reported in the literature [34]. In NaCl-NaOH solutions with [OH -] &gt; 0.03 M, the H + concentration was calculated from the given fixed hydroxide concentration [OH -] and the conditional ion product 𝐾 󸀠 w of water. In MgCl 2 solutions, the highest pH is fixed by the precipitation of Mg(OH) 2 (cr) (or Mg 2 (OH) 3 Cl ⋅ 4H 2 O(cr) in MgCl 2 ≥ 2 m) which buffers pH conditions at pH c = pH max ∼ 9 [34]. Redox potentials were measured with Pt combination electrodes with Ag/AgCl reference system (Metrohm) and converted to 𝐸 h vs. the standard hydrogen electrode by correction for the potential of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode (+208 mV for 3 M KCl at 25 ∘ C).

Liquid junction potentials below 50 mV are expected in the conditions of this study <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[37]</ref>.

In some of these systems, the formation of a solid phase occurred at near-neutral to alkaline pH conditions (SnCl 2 , Fe(II)/Fe(III) and Fe powder). In each experimental series, pH values were adjusted with either HCl-NaCl-NaOH or HCl-MgCl 2 -Mg(OH) 2 of identical ionic strength.

Briefly, the supernatant of the sample was contacted with an anion exchanger 50 mM tetraphenylphosphonium chloride (TPPC) in chloroform. After vigorous mixing for 1 minute and subsequent separation of the aqueous and organic phases by centrifugation, Tc concentration in the aqueous phase was determined by LSC and attributed to presence of Tc(IV). Six additional samples in 5.0 M NaCl and 4.5 M MgCl 2 were prepared in the presence of macroscopic amounts of magnetite (solid-to-liquid ratio, S : L = 21 g L -1 ), mackinawite (S : L = 30 g L -1 ) and siderite (S : L = 20 g L -1 ). Initial concentration of Tc(VII) was set to 2 × 10 -4 M to allow XANES analysis, and a contact time of 4 weeks was adopted in all cases. pH c , 𝐸 h and [Tc] (after 10 kD ultrafiltration) were determined before phase separation using centrifugation at 4020 𝑔. The wet paste resulting after phase separation was placed into double confined sample holders, heat-sealed inside the Ar-glovebox and stored in a N 2 Dewar (Voyager 12, Air Liquide -DMC, France) until the collection of XANES spectra.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Tc redox chemistry in reducing aqueous systems</head><p>Experimental 𝐸 h values are below the thermodynamically expected Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) borderline. 𝐸 h values with large uncertainties (up to ±100 mV) are observed in near-neutral to slightly alkaline pH conditions. This observation is likely related with the known degradation of Na 2 S 2 O 4 under less alkaline to acidic pH conditions [43, 44]. No significant differences were observed between the 𝐸 h values measured in dilute and concentrated NaCl solutions. On the contrary, large differences (up to 5 pe-units) arise between 𝐸 h values measured in dilute and concentrated MgCl 2 solutions, hence hinting towards a strong impact of ionic strength, [Cl -] and/or [Mg 2+ ] on the redox couple controlling the 𝐸 h in this system. A significant decrease of Tc concentration indicating the reduction of Tc(VII) to Tc(IV) is observed in all systems with Na 2 S 2 O 4 (Figs. 2b and 2d). The predominance Bereitgestellt von | Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT) Angemeldet Heruntergeladen am | 29.01.15 10:55 of Tc(IV) in the aqueous phase is confirmed for selected samples by solvent extraction (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>).

The redox couple Sn(II)/Sn(IV) controlling the 𝐸 h in this system is strongly impacted by ionic strength, [Cl -] and/or [Mg 2+ ], with pe + pH c values ranging from 2 ± 1 to 7 ± 1 in 0.5 M NaCl and 4.5 M MgCl 2 , respectively. Very similar pe + pH c values like in 0.5 M NaCl were recently reported for Sn(II) solutions in 0.1 M NaCl (pe + pH c = 2 ± 1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The very reducing 𝐸 h values fixed by Sn(II) promote a fast (𝑡 1/2 = 7 d) and complete reduction of Tc(VII) to Tc(IV) in NaCl solutions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3b</ref>). This observation is confirmed by solvent extraction, which indicates the predominance of Tc(IV) (≥ 92%) in all NaCl samples analysed (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>). The shape of the Tc(IV) solubility curve obtained from oversaturation in these systems is in excellent agreement with thermodynamic calculations performed at 𝐼 = 0 according with NEA-TDB data selection (solid line in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3b</ref>). This observation strongly suggests that equilibrium conditions have been attained in the system, as well as hinting towards the expected predominance of TcO 2 ⋅ 1.6H 2 O(s) and TcO 2+ , TcO(OH) + , TcO(OH) 2 (aq) and TcO(OH) 3 -as solubility controlling solid phase and Tc(IV) hydrolysis species in equilibrium, respectively. Tc concentrations determined in the acidic pH range are also in very good agreement with the undersaturation solubility data reported by Hess and coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> (also shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3b</ref>). This indicates that the same solid phase has been obtained from oversaturation (present work) and undersaturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> conditions. Our data also confirm the strong effect of ionic strength on Tc(IV) solubility under acidic conditions, where <ref type="bibr">[Tc]</ref> in equilibrium with TcO 2 ⋅ 1.6H 2 O(s) increases 1.5-2 logunits between 0.5 M and 5.0 M NaCl. Note that in the pHrange of our study (pH c ≥ 2), the thermodynamic model by Hess and co-workers explains the increase of solubility by ion interaction phenomena, and disregards the formation of Tc(IV)-Cl complexes. Very low [Tc] are observed in 0.25 M MgCl 2 at 3.5 ≤ pH c ≤ 9 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">3d</ref>), in good agreement with data in 0.5 M NaCl. Significantly higher <ref type="bibr">[Tc]</ref> are observed in 2.0 M and 4.5 M MgCl 2 . Both systems are affected by strong kinetics (especially for pH c = pH max ∼ 9), which likely hinders thermodynamic equilibrium even after 395 d. This hypothesis was further evaluated by Tc(IV) solubility samples prepared from undersaturation. Within this approach, the solubility experiment is started with a macroscopic amount of solid phase contacted with Tc-free supernatant solution.

Hence, Tc(IV) prepared electrochemically was precipitated as TcO 2 ⋅ 1.6H 2 O(s) [46] in a dilute NaOH solution (pH c ∼ 11), separated from the supernatant and contacted with two 4.5 M MgCl 2 solutions (pH c = 4 and pH max ) in the presence of 2 mM Sn(II). The aqueous concentration of Tc(IV) in equilibrium with TcO 2 ⋅ 1.6H 2 O(s) as determined from undersaturation conditions is marked as ⊕ in Figure 3. Lower Tc concentrations observed at pH max in 4.5 M MgCl 2 support the trend observed from oversaturation and confirm that no thermodynamic equilibrium is attained after 395 d in these conditions. On the contrary, very similar [Tc] are measured at pH c = 4 from undersaturation and oversaturation approaches, thus indicating that the same solid phase (expectedly TcO 2 ⋅ 1.6H 2 O(s)) is controlling the solubility in both cases and confirming  that thermodynamic equilibrium has been also attained in the latter case. Solvent extraction analysis of the supernatant solution in 2.0 M and 4.5 M MgCl 2 indicates 62%-99% content in Tc(IV), depending upon pH and ionic strength (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">3</ref>). Similar observations in concentrated NaCl solutions were reported by Hess and co-workers, who confirmed the predominance of Tc(IV) in the same samples us-ing UV-VIS/NIR. Note that the solvent extraction method used in this work has been reported to extract into the organic phase not only MO 4 -species (M = Re, Mn, Tc, I) but also anionic chloride complexes such as SnCl 6 value of 0.63 V can be calculated based on Eq.

This value is in excellent agreement with the measured redox potential (0.64 ± 0.05 V), thus supporting the validity of the 𝐸 h values experimentally determined in the Fe systems. 𝐸 h values below the calculated Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) borderline are measured in the near-neutral and alkaline pH regions. Under these conditions, the formation of a black Fe precipitate (likely magnetite) occurs. Thermodynamic calculations considering the formation of this solid phase predict the decrease of 𝐸 h towards more reducing conditions, although the exact redox potential is strongly dependent on the particle size of the solid forming (and thus on the selected log * 𝐾 ∘ 𝑠,0 ). A clear decrease of Tc concentration occurs under near-neutral to hyperalkaline pH conditions indicating the reduction of Tc(VII), whereas [Tc] remains ∼ 10 -5 M in the acidic pH region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4b</ref>). This is in good agree-ment with the thermodynamic borderline for 50:50% Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) redox distribution calculated with NEA-TDB and SIT/Pitzer ionic strength corrections as described in Sect. 2. These observations are also in line with data reported by Zachara and co-workers, who observed a rapid reduction of Tc(VII) in the presence of Fe(II) at pH &gt; 6.8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.

The very low concentration of Tc reached in these conditions compared to Sn(II) systems and undersaturation solubility experiments (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3</ref>) indicate that sorption of Tc(IV) on the forming magnetite may have occurred.</p></div>

In analogy to Na 2 S 2 O 4 systems, the increase of ionic strength induces only a minor effect on the 𝐸 h values measured in NaCl solutions. For this background electrolyte system, the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox pair define 𝐸 h values above the calculated Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) borderline under acidic pH conditions. At pH c = 2-3, most of the initial Fe(II) aq and Fe(III) aq are retained in solution. For these conditions, 𝐸 h values can be thermodynamically calculated considering the chemical reaction Fe 2+ ⇔ Fe 3+ + e -. Assuming [Fe(II)] 0 = [Fe(II)] aq and [Fe(III)] 0 = [Fe(III)] aq , and considering [Fe(II)] aq = [Fe 2+ ] and [Fe(III)] aq = [Fe 3+ ]+𝛴[FeCl n 3-n ]+ 𝛴[Fe(OH) n 3-n ] at pH c = 2 in 0.5 M NaCl, an 𝐸 therm h</figDesc></figure>

Concentration of Tc in solution remains unaffected for samples in the acidic pH region with 𝐸 h values above the calculated Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) borderline (Figure 4d), thus indicating the predominance of Tc(VII). These observations are further confirmed by solvent extraction analysis as summarized in Table</figDesc></figure>

This confirms that no solid phase transformation took place in the concentrated brines at the given pH conditions. 𝐸 h and pH c values measured in the Fe mineral suspensions (magnetite, mackinawite and siderite) after 4 weeks equilibration time are summarized in Table 4. In all cases, experimental 𝐸 h values are below the observed Tc(VII)/Tc(IV) reduction borderline. Analog to previous observations for other reducing systems reported in this work, 𝐸 h values in 4.5 M MgCl 2 media are significantly higher than in 5.0 M NaCl (∼ 2 pe-units) at the same pH c , characteristic for a redox couple strongly impacted by ionic strength, [Cl -] and/or [Mg 2+ ]. 𝑅 d values (𝑅 d = [Tc] s [Tc] aq ⋅ 𝑉 𝑚 , in L kg -1 ) were derived from experimental data to assess Tc sorption properties in saline samples (see Table 4).
