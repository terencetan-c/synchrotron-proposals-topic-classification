<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We performed an experiment on photoreactions of mercury iodide (HgI2) compounds at ID09B beamline. It is known that 267 nm excitation of the compound leads to dissociation of a Hg-I bond, and simultaneously, vibrational excitation of the remaining Hg-I bond. The goal of the experiment was to see the kinetics and structural dynamics how the excited Hg-I bond relaxes. More specifically, we expected to see the ultrafast change of Hg-I bond distance and the rearrangement of surrounding solvent cage due to the vibrational relaxation.</p><p>We used a typical pump-probe setup installed at ID09B for the experiment. The pulses from a femtosecond CPA amplifier ( = 800 nm) was converted to desired wavelength (267 nm) and used. In order to avoid multiphoton excitations, the pulses were stretched with silica prisms to the pulse length of ~2 ps before reaching the sample. After the excitation, the reaction was probed using hard X-ray pulses (Ephoton = 18.0 keV). The sample was dissolved in methanol to a final concentration of 15 mM and delivered as a liquid jet. Scattering patterns were collected using FReLoN CCD.</p><p>Time-resolved x-ray scattering signals were obtained at various time points; -3ns, -100ps, 0,  100ps, 178ps, 316ps, 562ps, 1ns, 1.78ns, 3.16ns, 5.62ns, 10ns, 17.8ns, 31.6ns, 56.2ns, 100ns, 178ns,  316ns, 562ns, 1us, 1.78us and 3.16us. (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) We could successfully obtain characteristic difference signals of HgI2.</p><p>Time-slicing experiment was also performed to capture ultrafast vibrational relaxation of HgI intermediate. We collected diffraction data at the following time points; -5ns, from -100 ps to 150 ps with 10 ps intervals, 150 ps to 250 ps with 20 ps intervals, and 250 ps to 400 ps with 30 ps intervals. (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) We could see that positive peak at ~2Å -1 started to grow from -70ps.</p><p>We measured methanol heating signals at 100ps and 1us from 267nm-excitation by using 2mM of dye (4'-diethylamino-2-methoxy-4-nitroazobenzene, CAS No. 6373-95-1) solution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In conclusion, we collected time-resolved X-ray solution scattering data of mercury iodide at several time delays including time-slicing experiment to investigate photoreaction dynamics of the molecule. As a result, difference curves with an extremely high signal to noise ratio was obtained. However, it was unable to retrieve any signal originating from the fast vibrational relaxation of Hg-I bond despite the high quality of data. From the result, we concluded that the vibrational relaxation occurs much faster than the temporal resolution of the time-slicing experiment, 10 ps.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 Difference scattering intensity curves from time-slicing experiment.
