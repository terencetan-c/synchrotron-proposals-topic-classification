The effectiveness of antibiotics depends on their ability to penetrate and accumulate into bacteria until they reach a threshold concentration sufficient to bind to their target and inhibit its activity 1 . However, the envelope of Gram-negative bacteria represents a barrier to this accumulation. On one hand, the outer membrane, with its outer layer exclusively made up of lipopolysaccharide, is impermeable to the diffusion of small polar molecules and antibiotics penetrate through the narrow channel of the porins (OmpF and OmpC in Escherichia coli and related enterobacteria). On the other hand, transmembrane efflux pumps are able to recognize and expel a wide range of antibiotics. Major efflux pumps belong to the Resistance, Nodulation, cell Division (RND) superfamily and share a common tripartite architecture with an active (proton-motive-force-dependent) drug transporter in the inner membrane, a channel forming protein in the outer membrane and a periplasmic linker protein. Not surprisingly, multidrug-resistant clinical strains often exhibit porin loss associated with overproduction of efflux pumps. For several years, MCT and the DISCO Beamline at SOLEIL have developed approaches based on the intrinsic fluorescence properties of certain antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones to quantify their accumulation in bacteria. Typically, spectrofluorimetry analysis of bacterial lysates is used to determine the intracellular antibiotic concentration in a bacterial population, while deep-UV (DUV) fluorescence microscopy is used to monitor the accumulation of an antibiotic into single intact bacteria in real-time 2 . However, the limited resolution of DUV microscopy (to approximately 150 nm) and the lack of fluorescence calibration impairs the possibility to obtain details on subcellular localization and intracellular quantification of the antibiotics inside the bacterial cells. Antibiotic-metal complexes as novel fluoroquinolone derivatives could be an alternative to conventional drugs. Numerous studies regarding the interaction between quinolones and metal cations have been reported and reviewed in the literature. In particular, Requimte laboratory (University of Porto) has reported the study of quinolone-metal and quinolone-metal-1,10-phenanthroline complexes (phen, a nitrogen donor heterocyclic ligand, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>) 3 . Interestingly, the copper ternary species are stable at physiological concentrations and retained their antibacterial activity against E. coli. Ciprofloxacin (Cip) is a potent and widely prescribed fluoroquinolone.</p><p>Fluorescence-based approaches showed that Cip is an efflux pump substrate, which accumulates twice as much in E. coli cells in the absence of the major efflux pump AcrB 4 . In this proposal, we followed metal-intracellular localization using nano-XRF. Bacterial cell cultures of AG100, wild-type and AG100A, acrB were treated or untreated to 5 µM of CuCip ternary complex during 15 minutes, as usually performed with unlabelled Cip.</p><p>-Results and the conclusions of the study: -Experiments were performed under vacuum (~1e -7 mbar) at room temperature on the Nano-Imaging beamline ID16A. The X-ray excitation energy was 17 keV, and all relevant elements were detected using their K-level emission lines. Nano-XRF measurements were performed with a step size of 20 nm and a dwell time of 50ms.</p><p>The summed spectrum recorded with a 6-element silicon drif detector (Sensortech, UK) was fitted with the open source sofware PyMCA. The absolute calibration to the elemental areal density (ng/mm 2 ) had previously been determined by a thin film standard (AXO Dresden GmbH). 2D maps have been recently weighted (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>) to obtain localization of elements. We will next calculate the average areal density corresponds to the mean inside the cells of the amount per unit surface of a given element (mostly P and Cu). The total intracellular amount of this element corresponds to the integral of the areal density over the cell area (surface). The total amount is equal to the average areal density multiplied by the area covered by the cell. Ideally, each condition should have been was measured by nano-XRF at least in 10 individual bacterial cells. However, we obtained less then 10 measurements with the chosen step size of 20 nm for AG100 incubated in the presence of CuCip due to a piezo-motor issue at the very beginning of the experiment.</p><p>Holotomography microscopy has been performed on one coarse field of AG100A exposed to CuCip, which is expeted to deliver nanoscale, label-free and can be combine with fluorescence for state-of-the-art spatiotemporal resolution as well as high molecular specificity. Fluotomography has also been performed on two coarse field corresponding to AG100 and AG100A exposed to CuCip for 3D localization of the elements. The latter data require 3D reconstruction and have not been fully analyzed yet.</p><p>The amount of CuCip quantified by nano-XRF will be compared to that of otained by spectrofluorimetry in the same conditions at SOLEIL. Levels of accumulation of CuCip and unlabelled Cip are similar in E. coli using spectrofluorimetry (around 1.25 fold more in AG100A in comparison to AG100). Interestingly, although data are still waiting to be fully analysed, nano-XRF shows that CuCip (copper-bound fluorescence, Cuka, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>) is not homogeneously distributed in E. coli but rather localized at the periphery of the bacterial nucleoid (phosphorus-bound fluorescence, Pka, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). This was even more clear in AG100A compared to AG100. Quinolones target the bacterial gyrase, which introduces negative and relieves positive supercoils necessary for DNA replication reactions to initiate and progress. The inhibition of DNA synthesis by quinolones is due not to the inhibition of gyrase activity per se but to the stabilization of the gyrase-DNA cleavage complex. In E. coli, the majority of gyrase molecules are not active, with GyrA and GyrB subunits randomly distributed in the cytoplasm, as shown by immunogold labelling 5 . More recently, high-speed single-molecule fluorescence imaging in live E. coli demonstrated that most of GyrA foci colocalized with the replisome 6 . Since Cip only captures gyrases during catalysis, our preliminary results suggest that copper-bound fluorescence after CuCip exposure corresponds to the localization functional gyrases. To confirm this hypothesis, we will submit a continuation proposal to use a derivative mutant of AG100 that carry mutations in a gyrase region that confer resistance to quinolones (AG100gyrA*). This region of GyrA has been termed the quinolone-resistancedetermining region (QRDR). Here, we expect random distribution of copper-bound fluorescence into E. coli as CuCip will be able to bind GyrA. All together, these results will provide formal proof of evidence that partitioning of CuCip is consistent with the binding of the antibiotic to its physiological target "in motion", which is increased in the absence of active efflux and are expected to be published in a high-rank journal.</p><p>-Justification and comments about the use of beam time: -Allocated beamtime of this proposal was 27 shifts. This was necessary to perform XRF-tomography experiments, which require a lot of time (around 6 hours each), on two independent samples; XRF-microscopy experiments on 4 different samples (two biological replicates of AG100 and AG100A  CuCip) in order to obtain a minimum of 10 individual bacterial cells for each as well as holotomography microscopy on coarse fields selected from nano-XRF. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (A) Localisation of elements in E. coli K12 cells by X-ray fluorescence nano-imaging.
