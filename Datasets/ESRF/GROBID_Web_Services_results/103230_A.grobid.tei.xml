<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Emergent phenomena between the CE-type and G-type orbital ordered ground states of Hg 1-x Na x Mn 3 Mn 4 O 12</p><p>Experiment number: HC-5203 Beamline: ID22 Date of experiment: from: 29/06/23 to: 03/07/23 Date of report: Shifts:</p><p>The colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) in manganite perovskites has been extensively investigated, with the key regime identified around x = 3/8 in La1-xCaxMnO3 (LCMO) to exhibit maximum MR effect. However, complications of the LCMO system associated with electronic phase separation have prevented an atomisticlevel understanding of the lattice, charge and orbital degrees of freedom in the phase diagram. Recently, we have used a prototype AMn A' 3Mn B 4O12 quadruple perovskite (A = Na1-Cax and La1-xCax), prepared with high pressure synthesis techniques, to tackle this issue. 1 With high resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction data obtained from ID22 and detailed crystallographic analysis, a compositional phase diagram, showing the evolution of the distortion modes associated with the various kinds of orbital order (OO), was obtained. A new kind of OO was revealed at the critical doping level Na0.4Ca0.6Mn3Mn4O12 (Mn B ~ Mn <ref type="bibr">+3.375</ref> ) consisting of orbital ordered and charge disordered stripes. Such a phase provides the missing intermediate states between C-type orbital order (Mn B = Mn 3+ , A = La) and the CE-type charge and OO (Mn B = Mn 3.5+ , A = Na) insulating phase, from which CMR is thought to emerge.</p><p>On the other hand, we have found related HgMn3Mn4O12 (HMO) to exhibit a polar ground state on account of charge transfer, between A and B sites, followed by G-type charge and orbital order on the B-sub lattice at low temperature. 2 Such behavior was not observed in the CaMn3Mn4O12 analogue, which forms instead an intermediate C-type orbital ordered structure with rhombohedral symmetry. This indicates that the mercury cation (Hg 2+ with filled 5d 10 orbital) plays a crucial role in the intertwined charge, orbital and spin coupling and the physical properties of HMO. These AMn A' 3Mn B 4O12 thus show an even richer orbital and charge ordered physics than their canonical LCMO counterparts.</p><p>To investigate more fully how the precise pattern of charge and orbital ordering, and hence properties, can be tuned in these fascinating materials, we have synthesised the novel series of materials Hg1-x (La,Ca,Na)xMn3Mn4O12, with single chemical substitution of either La, Ca, Na for Hg at the A-site, under high pressure conditions. The substitution results in not only the tuning of the charge on the B-site, but also the unique series of structural phase transitions observed across the series. Therefore, in order to resolve the weak superstructure peaks, monoclinic and tetragonal pseudo-symmetry-breaking distortions in these materials that are associated with their different orbital ordered states, the high resolution data obtained by ID22 was required.</p><p>High resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data were collected in the temperature range 10 K ≤ T ≤ 300 K for the compositions in the series Hg1-x(La,Ca,Na)xMn3Mn4O12 (0 &lt; x ≤ 0.5), with representative datasets at 300 K and 10 K shown in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. For the Na substituted series, at 300 K the evolution of rhombohedral to cubic space group symmetries is observed as a function of Na composition at a critical point of x = 0.3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Furthermore, in comparison to the datasets collected at 10 K a temperature-induced phase transition from rhombohedral to orthorhombic symmetries is observed for compositions in the range 0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.3, while for the higher substitutions it is likely that a cumulation of cubic, orthorhombic and monoclinic phases are present. For the La-substituted series, rhombohedral symmetry is preserved as a function of composition at 300 K, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Upon cooling to 10 K, orthorhombic symmetry is rapidly suppressed as a function of composition. Preliminary Rietveld refinements for the x = 0.05 and 0.10 compositions indicate both rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases emerge upon cooling to 10 K (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), while for x ≥ 0.15 only the rhombohedral phase is present.</p><p>Next steps in the data analysis for these datasets includes the optimisation of Rietveld refinements of various structual models used to describe the rich orbital ordering regimes present in the quadruple manganite perovskites. Additionally, datasets with compositions involving Ca-substitution will be further investigated once the Na and La series have been more fully mapped, whereby signatures of incommensurability are present in this series and not in the latter two series. Furthermore, by using the symmetry-motivated basis of irrreducible representation analysis, the evolution of the distortion modes controlling the emergence of the different orbtial ordered states will be systematically tracked as a function of temperature and composition. This will then provide mechanistic insight into how the different orbital regimes arise, enabling us to understand how these structural distortions couple together and give rise to useful technological properties including mangetoelectric and magnetoresistance effects.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>[ 1 ]</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Wei-Tin Chen, Chin-Wei Wang, Ching-Chia Cheng, Yu-Chun Chuang, Arkadiy Simonov, Nicholas C.
