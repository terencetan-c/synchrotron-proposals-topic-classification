<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> displays the apparent Herman's factor which quantify the molecular orientation, f H (q = 1.36 √Ö -1 ) evolution with elongation ratio for the different composite systems. The molecular orientation of polymer chains in the stretching direction is impacted by the EPDM matrix type (E1 is low diene content and E2 high diene content). Apparently, increasing the diene content decrease the orientation effects (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Due to the rigidity (non-deformability) of the filler, some orientation could result from the localization of deformation occurring only in the polymer phase. In fact, CB nanocomposite may not be regarded as a two-phase material with individual deformations since there are high interactions at nanoscale between filler and matrix. Moreover, such systems may exhibit complex deformation processes at different length scales, such as (i) inter-aggregate reorganizations in the zones containing fewer polymer chains, (ii) simultaneous relaxation of chains occurring after large scale reorganizations of aggregates, after un-grafting of the chains from the surface of the particles or chain breakage.</p><p>Then the CB structural reorganization can be studied by the variation of the scattered intensities and the exponents of the generalized Porod's laws in different regions of the scattering diagrams during stretching. Indeed, such exponents are known to reflect the compaction state of aggregates. In the literature, it was reported that the morphology of CB aggregates can be studied by SAXS in the low-q region (q &lt; 0.085 √Ö -1 ) <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. Similarly, in our data, the exponent value a during stretching is decreasing in the meridional direction which implies that the degree of interpenetration decreases along the stretching direction. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>,b, the scattering diagrams in the meridional direction (I // ) and in the equatorial direction (I‚ä•) during tensile test reveal the subtle changes in CB interpenetration. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>,d displays the changes, observed in the low-q range (region I), in exponent a // (in I // ) and a‚ä• (in I‚ä• ) during stretching of E1 filled with 35% of low structure CB sample. The value of a // is decreasing during stretching, associated with a disentanglement along the meridional direction. On the contrary, the value of a‚ä• is increasing during stretching until ùúÜ 1.8, which means that CB aggregates interpenetrate each other in the equatorial direction during stretching. This microstructural scenario is in good agreement previous to interpretations of the evolution of conductivity during stretching [3] performed on the same materials. However, at higher elongation (ùúÜ 1.8), the value of a‚ä• is decreasing, thus revealing a different deformation mechanism. In the high-q region (0.02 &lt; q &lt; 0.1 √Ö -1 ), the scattered intensity is the signature of the surface fractal of the primary CB particles, and it also follows a power law (I(q) ‚àù q b ). The value of the exponent b is also reported in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d</ref>, in the meridional (b // ) and equatorial (b‚ä•) directions. According to the literature, the typical value for b is <ref type="bibr">between -3.3 and -3.8 [1,2]</ref>. In both directions, b stays almost constant for ùúÜ 1.8, and it is slightly decreasing for ùúÜ 1.8. This observation is not expected to originate from a modification of the surface of primary particles (CB) since it is not affected by stretching the nanocomposite material. Therefore, this variation of b could be explained by the contribution of new scatterers such as nano-voids (nv) with net interface, thus exhibiting a more conventional Porod's behaviour with b nv =-4. In order to identify if cavitation is active at large extension ratios, we evaluated the invariant (see below). As it can be found in WAXS and SAXS investigation, the equatorial region is strongly impacted by the evolution of the microstructure of CB network which occurs during stretching.  <ref type="figure">3</ref> synthesize the mechanisms we have identified thanks to our coupling set-up. The final decrease of the conductivity before rupture could be used as a criterion for monitoring damages that might occur in service, notably since it appears to be the signature of the apparition of cavitation.</p><p>-Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.): -The conductivity measurements performed under uniaxial traction on carbon black filled elastomers have revealed unexpected percolation schemes. To resolve the structural phenomena explaining these results, in situ coupled measurements of conductivity and SAXS-WAXS under traction have been performed during loading-unloading cycles (impossible on benchtop SAXS-WAXS apparatus). The results will be included in a publication.</p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Fig</head><figDesc>Fig. 3. Scheme of microstructural mechanisms observed with Electrical/Mechanical/Structural coupling. The increase of stress is related to EPDM orientation, the increase of conductivity is correlated with CB lateral interpenetration and decrease of conductivity is due to cavitation during tensile test To sum up, electrical properties were correlated with tensile tests and in situ synchrotron SAXS/WAXS. Such coupling of several techniques offers a microstructural view with anisotropic reorganization of CB aggregates and nanocavitation, providing explanations of the electrical and mechanical law of behaviours. Fig.3synthesize the mechanisms we have identified thanks to our coupling set-up. The final decrease of the conductivity before rupture could be used as a criterion for monitoring damages that might occur in service, notably since it appears to be the signature of the apparition of cavitation.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,76.32,232.32,269.76,170.40" type="bitmap" /></figure>
