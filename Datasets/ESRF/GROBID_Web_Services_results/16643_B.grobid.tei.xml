<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The interfaces between magnetic and non-magnetic layers are of high importance for many magnetic properties such as the magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA). It is well established that electronic hybridization at the interfaces of 3d and 5d transition metals (TM) can lead to a spin orientation perpendicular to the layers which is preferred for magneto-optical recording applications. The strong 5d spin-orbit coupling and an induced magnetic moment at the interface layer have been identified as the main driving force for the perpendicular spin arrangement. A similar phenomenon is observed at 3d TM / rare earth (RE) interfaces. There, however, it is expected that a different mechanism dominates especially at low temperatures when the indirect exchange coupling between TM 3d and RE 4f shell mediated by the RE 5d electrons induces a significant 4f magnetic moment. In this single-ion anisotropy picture the strong crystalline field of the TM interface atoms acting on the large orbital quadrupole moment of the RE 4f shell pulls the spins out-of-plane. The magnetization of Fe/CeH 2 is oriented perpendicular to the layer planes in a multidomain configuration at low temperatures [1]. This is expected as a consequence of a strong interface MCA that promotes a spin orientation perpendicular to the layers and the magneto-static interaction between spins. The latter tries to force the spins in-plane and usually dominates at high temperatures. The perpendicular magnetization configuration is considerably stabilized when the multilayer magnetization splits up into adjacent spin-up and down domains of regular size (stripe domains) which can be readily detected with x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) in the geometry shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> [2]. XRMS in the soft x-ray region is sensitive to the magnetic domain structure of Fe 3d and Ce 4f electrons. The corresponding spectra are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. We find a different domain structure of the Fe 3d and Ce 4f subsystems. While at the Fe L 3 edge the XRMS scans show pronounced side peaks characteristic of stripe-like domains [2] the magnetic domain pattern at the Ce M 5 edge is clearly more disordered. The magnetic scattering contribution of the Ce 4f electrons can be identified by forcing the sample into a single domain state by applying a strong magnetic field (dotted curve in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This different domain structure rules out crystal-field induced single-ion anisotropy as the microscopic driving force of the perpendicular spin orientation. The magnetic stripe-domain configuration also leads to a straightforward separation of firstand second-order magnetic scattering contributions as magnetic superstructure Bragg peaks. The first-order contribution probes mainly the magnetic moment. The second-order contribution is a measure of the spin-orbit quadrupole moment that describes the difference in the expectation value of the spin-orbit interaction with the spins aligned along the easy and hard magnetic axis of the system. This quantity is directly related to the MCA [3]. and Ce M5 absorption edges (solid lines).</p><p>A magnetic field of 1 T was appied to quench the magnetic domains (dotted line).</p></div>
