<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Polyamine oxidase catalyses the oxidation of spermine, a central reaction in the polyamine metabolism. Data from four crystals soaked in different competitive inhibitors have been collected. The main results deriving from the experiment are:</p><p>(1) structure determination of the enzyme (by MIR and threefold averaging) has been completed (Rfactor=19.5% for 216570 reflections). Polyamine oxidase represents the first flavin-dependent amine oxidase for which the 3D structure is available; (2) cancer cells strictly require polyamines for their growth. The structural analysis of 4 enzyme-inhibitors has provided information on the catalytic and substrate specificity properties. This knowledge will provide the starting point for the design of compounds with anti-cancer activity.</p><p>L-aspartate oxidase catalyses the first step in the bacterial de novo biosynthesis of NAD. The enzyme shares a number of functional and structural (i.e. 30% sequence identity) properties with the flavin subunit of succinate dehydrogenase. In our laboratory, we have been working on this enzyme for four years, encountering a number of difficulties with reproducibility of crystals and identification of good heavy atom derivatives. Data collection at ESRF has three heavy atom derivatives have been collected. These data were used for phasing by the program SHARP. The resulting map was of first class quality. Lasparrate oxidase displays a Dartially new fold and its structure will be of general interest for gaining insight into the class of succinate dehydrcJgnease/fumarate reductase oxidoreductases.</p></div>
