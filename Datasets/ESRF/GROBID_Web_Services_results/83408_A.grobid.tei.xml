<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>In situ determination of dual scale flow for glass &amp; carbon fiber woven fabrics by laminography The laminograms were acquired in the middle of the sample (thus avoiding any edge effect) at a) Flow direction b) t1 t2 t3 Syringe pump X-rays Figure 1: a) Infiltration before laminograms were taken. b) Shows the observation point at different times during the experiment showing the evolution of the flow front several distances from the inlet to observe the flow front at different positions as well as the transport processes behind the flow front. These observation points were marked prior to experiments on the mould, Fig 2.</p><p>Each experiment was divided in rounds (different infiltration times), in which between 1-4 laminograms were taken. The number of laminograms per round depends on the injection velocity. The observed positions were selected to acquire the position ahead of the flow front, at the flow front and behind it. This sequence allows to obtain the infiltration evolution in the same area of fibres. During the experiments, photograph centered in the observation points were taken from above the mould, Fig 2b.</p><p>Already the radiographies at an inclined angle, Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, allows for the observation of an inhomogenous viscous flow front (different grades of gray shades), through the different interply faces. The generation of porosity is also visble from this simple inspection, which is only posible with the use of X-rays. The reconstruction of some volumes is still been performed and the 3D quantitative information of the already reconstred volumes is been processed. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows a reconstructed slice at the flow front. Capturing the flow front with different injection velocities will provide valuable information about the dual-scale flow mechanisms in these materials. Besides, the image quality allows to obtain the meso-porosity (intertow) as well as the relevant micro-porosity (intratow), resin meniscus shape, impact of the fibre orientation, pore transportation, etc.</p><p>For instance, a qualitative inspection of the volumes shows already the difference between low and high injection velocities. In the case of low injection velocities capilary forces prevail, Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>(a-b), leaving intertow pores trapped between the fiber tows. At high injection velocities, however, the viscous flow moves faster than the capillar flow and small intratow pores are left inside the tows. The influence of high and low injection velocities on the viscous flow front and, therefore, on the generation of porosity on the final part can be observed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4(c-d</ref>). A faster viscous flow is more homogeneous in the ply interface (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>)than a slowler flow (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>). In the later case, the heterogeneous flow front generates more voids. All this information will be used to develop appropriate simulations to infer the optimum infiltration conditions for these type of materials.

During the beamtime MA3491 (July 2017), one single liquid (an epoxy resin with high viscosity) and on type of fibers (E-glass) were systematically tested, i.e. applying different infiltration velocities, due to the limited time granted for this proposal (6 out of 9 shifts requested). In situ resin infiltration experiments were performed at 26keV, FOV of 5.3x5.3mm and a resolution of 2.2μm using a PCO.edge detector. The projections scan time was 1.5min (50msec exp. And 1799 projections) and the SDD 295mm which allows for Paganing reconstruction. The inclination table angle was set to 32.5º. During the experiments, different regimes of resin flow were achivied by adjusting the resin injection velocity for each infiltration experiment. This velocity is controlled by a syringe pump, Fig 1, developed specially for this experiment in order to comply with the beamline requests (weight, size, etc). The syringe containing the resin is connected to the inlet of the a special transparent mould developed for this experiement. The PMMA mould (low absorption coefficient) allow observing roughly the flow with naked eye to locate the flow front region and scan it with X-rays. The x-rays go through the thickness of the mould, Fig 1.</figDesc></figure>
