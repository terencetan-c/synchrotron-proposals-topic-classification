<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context and objective</head><p>Mercury Hg is one of the most concerning contaminant on Earth, particularly because it is converted into methylmercury (MeHg), a strong neurotoxin. MeHg is mainly produced and released in the environment by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in anoxic sediments but the mechanisms of Hg methylation are still poorly understood, especially at the cell level. We investigated an original SRB Hg methylating model strain Pseudodesulfovibrio hydrargyri BerOc1 and its mutant DhgcB BerOc1 unable to methylate Hg that we have produced in our laboratory. Our aim was to clarify the way of Hg accumulation at the cell level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental:</head><p>BerOc1 cells were grown in anaerobic conditions in culture medium and exposed to 0 or 400 ppb HgCl2 during 4h. Cells were centrifuged, rapidly washed twice in culture medium and water, deposited on Si3N4 windows, blotted and immediately frozen in liquid ethane using a cryoplunge Leica EM GP. Frozen samples were transferred into the analysis chamber using a cryotransfert shuttle and analyzed at LN2 temperature. 2D nanoXRF maps were collected at 17 keV with a flux of 1 10 11 ph/s and the beam was focused on the sample with KB mirrors to a beamsize of 39 nm (V) x 63 nm (H). Fluorescence signal was collected with a 4-element detector and measurements were carried out with a dwell time of 100 ms and a step of 30 nm. An AXO standard was measured for calibration. Elemental maps were obtained using PYMCA software after spectral fitting. Some cells were selected for nano XRF tomography. In this case, the sample was rotated with a 6° angle and for each position, maps were collected with a step of 40 nm and a countng time of 50 ms to minimize beam radiation damage. The volume was then reconstructed using a Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Result:</head><p>First, for the BerOc1 wildtype we observed a high heterogeneity between the cells in a same culture (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Some cells showed high amount of Hg, preferentially located at the periphery of the cell, while most of the cells contain undetectable level of Hg. We identified extracellular nano particles of Hg that colocalized with S. These nanoparticles probably correspond to bHgS particles that we previously observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Isaure et al. 2020)</ref> and that could form due to cysteine degradation by the bacteria. Nano-XRF tomography performed on a Hg-enriched cell showed that Hg was preferentially distributed at the rim level, suggesting a sorption of Hg and/or sequestration ate the membranes/periplasm level (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). We hypothesized that the Hg hyperaccumulating cells are dead cells that sorb mercury while the 'healthy' bacteria are able to methylate Hg and export it out of the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Isaure et al. 2020)</ref>.  Similar heterogeneity was observed for the DhgcB BerOc1 mutant with Hg accumulating cells and most of the cells containing undetectable Hg (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Extracellular nano particles were also identified. We conclude that the unability to methylate Hg does not change the location of Hg in the cell and does not result in a higher Hg accumulation in the cells. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Marie-Pierre Isaure*, Maureen Le Bars, Marisol Goñi-Urriza, Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour, IPREM UMR5252 * One experimentalist due to COVID restriction</figDesc></figure>
