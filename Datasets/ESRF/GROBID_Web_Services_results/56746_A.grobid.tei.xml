<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1. Who took part in the experiments? (Please indicate names and affiliations) Dr Victoria Flexer-Gent University Dr Rosie Grayburn-Gent University Michel de Keersmaecker-Gent University Pieter-Jan Sabbe-Gent University Florencia Marchini-Universidad de Buenos Aires-Argentina Prof Mark Dowsett-University of Warwick -UK 2. Were you able to execute the planned experiments? YES 3. Did you encounter experimental problems? YES We had 3 different types of problems:</p><p>-BEAMLINE: the beamline energy was inadequate, too high, it was penetrating too far away in our sample, and therefore the signal of the underlying substrate was much stronger than the signal of the layers we were trying to grow and study. Moreover, the detector had quite a poor resolution, that made it necessary for us to acquire data for in between 100-200 seconds for a single diffractogram, which way too long for studying a real-time electrochemical process.</p><p>-EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM: we were working with organic solvents, and after long-term exposure, these attacked the-orings of our electrochemical cell, producing small leakages that had to be cared for -OUR CONTROL SYSTEM: our control system (controlling motor moving our electrode and sending pulses to the potentiostat) was controlled by a new software, and this new software was producing some problems in controlling the system in automatic mode.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Was the local support adequate? YES</head><p>5. Are the obtained results at this stage in line with the expected results as mentioned on the project proposal? YES/NO (If NO, please specify)  We could not follow in real time the growth of Li2O2 or of decomposition products since the signal of these was barely distinguishable from the underlying substrate, as specified above in the experimental problems associated to the beamline. NO (most probably, results will be further analysed, but highly unlikely)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="9.">Additional remarks</head><p>We had originally requested beamtime in BM01A, which we thought was more adequate for the experiments we were planning (right beamline energy, better resolution and faster detector), but we were instead given beamtime in BM01B.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>6.</head><figDesc>Are you planning follow-up experiments at DUBBLE for this project? NO 7. Are you planning experiments at other synchrotrons in the near future? YES 8. Do you expect any scientific output from this experimental session (publication, patent, ...)</figDesc></figure>
