<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A copper bi-crystal was mounted in the compression-loading machine shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, with an additional stress-sensor (not shown). The grain boundary (GB) is perpendicular to the axis of loading. The machine was installed using a specially made plate into the BM32 microdiffraction setup. The working plane was 3 mm downstream of the ideal KB-focussing plane along the beam, in order to avoid collisions between the machine and the KB enclosure.</p><p>The bi-crystal deformation was investigated, using both white beam (for orientation and deviatoric strain mapping) and monochromatic beam (for lattice expansion mapping). Four states of strain were studied in a centred area including the GB: (1) before loading, (2) at yield, (3) in the plastic domain at ~2% strain, and (4) after unloading.</p><p>For each deformation step, the compression machine was removed from the microdiffraction setup to mount the electric motor and monitor the local deformation qualitatively (e.g. appearance of slip lines) and global deformation quantitatively (macroscopic strain) with a large-field optical microscope. The latter measure is calculated with the help of accurate photographs of two widely spaced lines of nano-indentation prints made on the top surface of the sample (see figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p>The experimental geometry was calibrated in the white beam mode using a Ge(111) single crystal. Three sets of measurements were collected at each loading step (with the grain boundary perpendicular to the x axis): using white beam (1) a large map of 500 x 500 microns in x and y, with a step of 5 microns in x and 10 microns in y and (2) three x-lines centred on the grain boundary, of 100 microns along x with a 1 micron step. Also, using monochromatic beam (3) one energy scan at 8 points along a x-line around the centre of the large map, at (-250, -125, -10, -5, +5, +10, +125, +250) microns in x from the grain boundary. Data analysis shows correlation between the glide system, visible on the microscopic view, and the microdiffraction results, particularly in term of local lattice rotation. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the sample surface before and during compression. The area studied with x-rays is marked with a red square. The orientation maps (i. As a preliminary step to the micro plastic strain calculation, which affects the shape and width of the Laue spots, maps of the spot-width (as fitted with a Lorentzian shape function) are reproduced in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Additional data analysis and theoretical work is needed to calibrate the Laue peak shapes evolution in terms of orientation / strain distribution and dislocation density. These results will be used to develop a physically justified crystal plasticity constitutive law accounting for the influence of grain boundaries during deformations. Results of this study were selected as an oral presentation in the TMS symposium "Neutron and X-ray studies of advanced materials" (February 2010, Seattle).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: copper bi-crystal in the compression machine.
