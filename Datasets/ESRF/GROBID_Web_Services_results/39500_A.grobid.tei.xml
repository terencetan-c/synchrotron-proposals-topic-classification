<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In this experiment, we have performed x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of Fe-polymeric spin-crossover compounds. The purpose was to observe the variation of the local structure around the magnetic Fe ions and also of their electronic structure with the temperature. This evolution in the structural and electronic properties should be directly linked with the transition from low-spin (LS) state at low temperatures to high-spin (HS) state at room temperature in such magnetic systems.</p><p>Two families of spin-crossover compounds were measured: Fe(X-py) 2 [Ag(CN) 2 ] 2 and Fe(X-py) 2 [Ni(CN) 4 ]. X-ray absorption spectra have been collected in the transmission mode, using partially filled gas ionization chambers to detect the incident and the transmitted beam. A continuous flow He-cryostat belonging to the beamline was used to measure the compounds at three temperatures, 15 K, 150 K and 300 K. Some of the samples have an intermediate step in the spin-state transition at around 150 K, and it was our interest to determine the local origin of this intermediate step.</p><p>Results show a progressive shift of the edge position while increasing the temperature for all the cases. This reduction in the oxidation state of iron (always around Fe 2+ ) is accompanied by the suppresion of the pre-edge feature at room temperature. This evolution in the electronic structure observed by the evolution of the edge spectra can be fully explained with the transition from LS to HS states. The spin transition comes together with a variation in the metal-ligand distances at different spin states. At short Fe-N distances, the crystal field leads to 3d splitting (in t 2g and e g sublevels), resulting in a LS configuration of the initial 3d 6 state of Fe 2+ ). However, at larger Fe-N distances, the effect of the Hund splitting could be larger than the crystal field splitting, and the final electronic configuration of the iron centers result in HS state.</p><p>7100 7150 7200 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 34-Ag Normalized Absorption Energy (eV) T=50 K T=160 K T=300 K 7100 7150 7200 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 Py-Ni Normalized Absorption Energy (eV) T=50 K T=140 K T=300 K</p><p>EXAFS analysis will give us information about the evolution of the Fe-N distances with temperature. It is worth to point that for the analysis, a broad k-range of around 13 Å -1 has been used for all the spectra and all the samples. Results confirm the idea suggested from the XANES observation. At low temperatures, the six N from the FeN6 octahedra are at the same distance, less than 2 Å for all the samples. With increasing temperatures, a splitting of the Fourier transform first peak is observed, suggesting a larger distance of the Fe-N bond due to distortion of the FeN6 octahedra. This effect is observed, whether the compounds are polymerized with Ag or Ni, though slight differences between the two families should be considered.</p><p>160 K 300 K 50 K kχ χ χ χ(k) 34-Ag 2 4 6 8 10 12 k (A -1 ) -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 160 K 300 K Fourier Transform 50 K 0 2 4 6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 Distance (A) 34-Ag Py-Ni 300 K 50 K 2 4 6 8 10 12 kχ χ χ χ(k) k (A -1 ) -0.2 0.0 0.2 300 K 50 K 0 2 4 6 -0.2 0.0 0.2 Fourier Transform Distance (A) Py-Ni</p><p>These results confirm the effect of the local structure in the spin state of Fe and its crossover from low temperature LS state (with very weak magnetization values) to room temperature HS state (with a remarkable increase of the magnetization at intermediate temperatures).</p><p>Moreover, from the quantitative analysis of the EXAFS oscillations and the observation of the XANES spectra, it can be concluded that the intermediate state at around 150 K in Ag-compounds is a combination of LS and HS states. These results by themselves will be the subject of a next paper submitted to an international journal to be considered for publication.</p><p>Other analogue phenomenon which provide a similar spin crossover effect in such compounds is the excitation of the samples with light. These light-induced spin-crossover effect can be precisely determined by x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and a forthcoming proposal should be submitted for consideration of the ESRF committee next run.</p></div>		</body>
