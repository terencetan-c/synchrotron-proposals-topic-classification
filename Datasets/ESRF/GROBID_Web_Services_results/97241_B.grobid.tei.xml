<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment was aimed at characterizing in situ the hydration of bassanite (CaSO4 x 0.5H2O) to form gypsum (CaSO4 x 2H2O) in the presence of additives that are commonly used in industry to produce gypsum plaster. Additives are commonly intruduced in the production process because they can modify the shape and dimensions of gypsum crystals and also tune the hydration reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Here, our goal was to compare using phase contrast tomography (PCT) the kinetics of the dissolution of bassanite and the precipitation of gypsum due to the use of the different additives. Moreover, we also performed single crystal diffraction (SXRD) and scanning 3DXRD on single crystals of bassanite and gypsum that were prepared in the laboratory through precipitation in solutions with the same additives. Scanning 3DXRD and SXRD were used to gain information on the mosaicity of the gypsum crystals and the pseudo-merohedral twinning of bassanite <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p><p>-In situ PCT experiment The effect of 2 additives was tested on the hydration process of gypsum plaster. Two samples were prepared. Bassanite crystals were placed inside glass capillaries with a diameter of 300 µm and hydrated in situ. The samples were hydrated with two solutions of 10 mM of respectively betanaphtalene sulfonate (BNS) and Polyacrylic acid (PAA). The experiment was conducted in the 3DXRD station of EH3 (one of the experimental hutches of ID11). The energy was 44 KeV. The full beam (no focusing devise used) illluminates a portion of 1 mm height of the capillaries. The projections throughout rotations of 360° were acquired with the camera Marana (2k x 2k) placed 360 mm from the sample. A pixel size of 0.63 µm was achieved using a 20x lens. After the injection of the solution in the capillaries, for each sample, a series of PCT scans were acquired for up to 24 h of hydration. The PCT scans were reconstructed using the in-house software nabu and tomwer canvas and successively analysed with Dragonfly. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the preliminary results obtained for the hydration of bassanite with a 10 mM solution of BNS. Those shown in the picture are ROIs of the capillary. The two phases, bassanite in purple and gypsum in green, were segmented using a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network implemented in Dragonfly. -Scanning 3DXRD and SXRD Three samples of gypsum and two samples of bassanite were measured with both scanning 3DXRD and SXRD on the Nanoscope station of EH3. The crystals were mounted and glued with UV glue on Kapton loops. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> shows the images of the bassanite samples that were measured. The energy was 44 KeV. In the case of the scanning 3DXRD measurements, the beam was focused to a size of 500 nm using Silicon compound refractive lenses. The measurements were performed acquiring one horizontal layer (x-direction) per single crystal with Δx = 500 nm and a rotation of 180° per each Δx. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows some preliminary results obtained from the extraction of the diffraction peaks recorded on the detector (Eiger 4M CdTe). The peaks were then used to reconstruct the sinogram (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) and intensity map (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) of the layer of the crystal. The preliminary data analysis was done using jupiter notebooks based on the ImageD11 software. For the SXRD measurements, the beam was focused to a 5 µm size with Aluminum compound refractive lenses. For each crystal, a total of 1440 frames were recorded during rotations of 360° with 0.25s exposure time. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the result of the preliminary analysis of the SXRD scan of one bassanite crystal. The image reports the diffraction spots of the samples in the reciprocal space. In the case of these crystals, three unit cells were identified representing the three twins of the pseudo-merohedral twinning. The preliminary data analysis has been done with the software CrysAlisPro. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
