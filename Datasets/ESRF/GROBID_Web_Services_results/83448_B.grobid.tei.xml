<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The primary goal of the proposed experiment is to unravel how the hemoglobin abnormalities (HbAS, HbAC) influence the fine structures on/inside plasma membranes and the accumulation of hemozoin (crystallites of hemoglobin enriched with Fe) in the disease state using a combination of magnified phase imaging and scanning X-ray fluorescence at ID16A. As a reference, we obtained 2d elemental distributions of uninfected red blood cells of the wildtype HbAA and the hemoglobinopathies HbAS and HbAC using a 17 keV monochromatic X-ray beam setting the scanning step size to 50 nm. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1depicts</ref> the elemental densities of potassium and iron measured for an uninfected HbAS cell, revealing a homogenious distribution of elements throughout the RBC cytoplasm. To investigate the fine structures appearing in infected cells the minimal stepsize of 25 nm was used. The corresponding elemental maps reveal among others the active pumping of potassium into the parasite occupied area (Figure 2a) and the formation of hemozoin crystallites in the digestive vacuole (DV) (Figure 2b). To obtain additional spatial information, 3-D tomographs were obtained by successively recording 2d phase contrast images and stepwise rotating the sample covering a total of 180° with 2000 steps. Main contrast is provided by the different concentrations of iron in the RBC. Hemozoin crysallites appear as contrast rich black rods Figure.3 Single reconstructed phase contrast image of the infected HbAS cell presented in Figure 2. (Scale bar 2µm)</p><p>To quantify the differences among the hemoglobinopathies further data analysis is required, including the elemental distributions of sulfur and phosphor.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure.1 Elemental densities of a) potassium and b) iron determined for an uninfected HbAS (Pixel Size 50 nm, Scale bar 2µm)</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.19,536.99,481.95,199.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
