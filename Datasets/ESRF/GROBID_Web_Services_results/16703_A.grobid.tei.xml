<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During the available beam time, two experiments were performed. The first one aimed to obtain the structure of MgSiO 3 -perovskite at different pressures, and temperature conditions as close as possible from 0 K, in order to get read of all thermal contributions, since such structure refinements may have important impacts for theoretical models of the MgSiO 3 -pv structure. We believe that this experiment will also provide a low temperature Eos of MgSiO 3 -pv with a precision not yet available. This is necessary for providing precise very high-temperature EoS calculated by the thermal pressure method. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 T (K) P (GPa)</p><p>We recorded ~40 diffraction patterns [Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>] on polycristalline samples (40x400x20 µm 3 ) pressurized under static conditions in a membrane diamond anvil cell up to 30 GPa, using He as a pressure-transmitting medium and a ruby chip to measure pressure. The cell was placed in a helium flow cryostat which allowed to cool the sample from 300 K down to 10 K. Temperature was measured with a Cu/constantan thermocouple down to 40 K and a Au-0.07% Fe/chromel couple for lower temperatures. A cross check of the actual temperature of the sample was also obtained in the 100-10 K range with the relative intensities of the fluorescence lines of the ruby. Hence, we do have high-quality data along one isotherm (100 K) up to 30 GPa, and along a pseudo-isobar down to 10 K. These data are currently being processed.</p><p>A second experiment was performed to estimate the influence of Aluminium on the bulk modulus of MgSiO 3 perovskite, at ambient temperature, down to pressure conditions relevant of the lower mantle. The results of this work have been submitted to Geophysical Research Letter, and have been presented at the ESRF workshop 'Science at high pressure: Latest trends from 3 rd generation sources'.</p><p>Abstract. Aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) is estimated to amount 4 to 5 mol% in all mantle compositional models, and is believed to be incorporated into (Mg,Fe)SiO 3 -perovskite under the pressure and temperature conditions of the lower mantle. Hence, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we have measured the 300 K equation of state of a perovskite with X Al = Al/Al+Mg+Si=.077, up to 32 GPa, in order to estimate the influence of Al on the compressibility of perovskite. A least square adjustment of two independent data sets yields the following equation of state parameters [V 0 = 163.52(3) Å 3 , K 0 = 229(4) GPa, and K' 0 = 2.5(4) GPa] [Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>]. The high compressibility of aluminous perovskite deduced from the present work, together with available experimental results from Zhang and Weidner <ref type="bibr">[1999]</ref> and ab initio calculations from Brodholt <ref type="bibr">[2000]</ref>, allow to assess the most probable substitution mechanism for aluminium into perovskite at pressures characteristics of the shallow lower mantle [Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>]. Al 3+ is likely to be incorporated in place of Si 4+ in the octahedral site of perovskite, hence requiring the creation of oxygen vacancies for charge balance. As a consequence, aluminous perovskites may have a higher affinity for water than pure MgSiO 3 -perovskite. The enhanced compressibility of aluminous perovskite certainly has also strong geophysical and geochemical implications, as it may revive perovskite-rich lower mantle models. Also, the transformation of garnet into compressible Al-rich perovskite at the top of the lower mantle may be responsible for the high-P-and -S velocity gradients observed between 660 and 760 km depth. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 140 145 150 155 160 165 Pressure (GPa) Fig. 3 Variation of cosθ=a/b ( ) and cosΦ= 2a/c ( ) for Al</p><p>.077 -perovskite as a function of pressure. Notice that a linear fit to the data (solid line) indicates that Φ remains almost constant up to 32 GPa. The evolution of the tilt angles for pure MgSiO 3 -perovskite (dashed line) have been reported for comparison <ref type="bibr">[Ross and Hazen, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fiquet et al., 2000]</ref>. This indicates a very different compression mechanism of aluminous perovskites along the c-axis, supporting the proposed substitution mechanism.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> Evolution of the compressibility of perovskite as a function of its Alcontent X Al = Al/(Mg+Si+Al). All bulk moduli reported are valid within the 0-10 GPa range, assuming a pressure derivative K' 0 = 4. Filled oragnge circles include the bulk moduli experimentally determined by Ross and <ref type="bibr">Hazen [1990]</ref>, Zhang and Weidner <ref type="bibr">[1999]</ref>, and the present results. While empty squares depict the bulk moduli calculated by <ref type="bibr">Brodholt [2000]</ref>, for the vacancy-free MgSiO 3 , (Mg 3 Al)(Si 3 Al)O 12 perovskites, and for the oxygen deficient Mg 2 Al 2 O 5 brownmillerite, large filled circles represent the corresponding experimental values approximately 7-8% higher <ref type="bibr">[Brodholt, 2000]</ref>. The solid line is only an interpolation between the available experimental and calculated bulk moduli. A linear fit to the experimental data (dashed line) indicates a very steep dependence of K 0 -3.9(1) 10 2 GPa on the alumium content in perovskite. This is only compatible with the incorporation of Al 3+ in place of Si 4+ in the octahedral site of perovskite, charge-balanced by the creation of oxygen vacancy.
