This has triggered an effort to understand the details of the oxide formation and reaction pathways on such materials and under such conditions on the atomic scale. In particular it has been discovered that thin so-called surface oxides are formed before the onset of the growth of a thicker oxide film. Since most of the more traditional UHV methods are based on the detection of electrons, such as Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) or Photo Electron Spectroscopy (PES), which suffers from the strong interaction of the electrons with the surrounding gas phase at elevated O partial pressure, a method of choice is Surface X-ray Diffraction (SXRD). At beamline ID3 an excellent experimental setup has been constructed to perform in-situ investigations of the interaction of a gas with a solid surface at ambient pressures. We have used this setup to investigate the initial oxidation of Rh( <ref type="formula">111</ref>) and in particular the surface oxide formed on this surface. The surface oxide forms at an O pressure of 1x10 -3 mbar and a sample temperature of 450 C. The resulting surface oxide is stable under UHV conditions. It adapts an hexagonal structure and forms a coincidence lattice with the underlying Rh( <ref type="formula">111</ref>  [2] B. Hendriksen et al Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 046101 (2002). [3] J.

The structure and composition can be deduced by a combination of SXRD (see Fig 1a), High Resolution Core Level Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT, See Fig 1b). It consists basically of a so-called tri-layer, two oxygen layers with one Rh layer in between (Fig 1b) [3]. [1] H. Over et al Science 287 (2000) 1474.</figDesc></figure>
