<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Prevention of sulfuric acid production in the timbers of Henry VIII's warship, the Mary Rose The aim of the experiment was to investigate the sulfur and iron speciation in waterlogged ships timbers from the Tudor warship, the Mary Rose, and to study the possible influence of iron chelating treatments.</p><p>These were our first experiments exploiting both S and Fe K-edges using ID21 and needed care in scheduling our measurements to allow for the extensive changeover time between these two edges. We also needed to consider how to best study before and after treatments, ideally this should be on the same specimen so that we were certain that any changes observed were due to the treatments and did not merely arise from natural variations in such a natural, heterogeneous material. In practice this proved more problematic than we had hoped for. Whilst it is practicable to keep the same sample mounted in the sample holder for the change from S to Fe edge, removing the thin fragment of sample to soak in the treatment solution and then successfully remount proved difficult. Additional uncertainties arising from this approach concern whether the soaking time available during the course of a single experiment is sufficient to allow any significant alteration. The types of measurement we collected here do however have the potential to show us how proposed treatment protocols interact with the iron and sulfur species contained within the wood cell structure. Our experiences in this run have proved useful in devising a revised future strategy to sample timbers at different stages of possible treatment protocols, whilst maintaining consistency of timber type and initial environment.</p><p>Nevertheless, we were successful in collecting both S and Fe K-edge valency information from the same area of several samples. We believe that this is the first time that this has been done for this type of problem and the first time that valence maps at the Fe K-edge have been collected. This is proving very insightful in understanding the interaction between iron and sulfur speciations in the wood timbers.</p><p>There is a wide energy shift at the sulfur K-edge separating the many possible sulfur valence states (from -2 to +6). At the Fe k-edge, there is less of a distinct resonant peak, but a clear shift is noticeable between Fe 2+ and Fe 3+ species. It is therefore possible to select a unique energy on the rising edge of the Fe 2+ K-edge, but which is still below the onset of the Fe 3+ edge, so that only the contribution from iron in the 2+ state is highlighted. This was then compared to a second map recorded well above the Fe K-edge which then shows both the Fe 2+ and the Fe 3+ contributions.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a series of valence state maps at sulfur and iron K-edges showing the distribution of key sulfur and iron phases within the wood cell structure. The sulfur maps show the presence of some reduced sulfur grains (2469.7eV) and a more widespread distribution of a slightly oxidised organo-sulfur component (2472.1eV). This latter species can be seen to reside primarily in the mid-lamella regions of the wood between adjacent cells. This sulfur distribution compares well with that previously obtained by Sandström et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> , although it should be noted that the energies we report here have been recalibrated to allow comparison with other SR experiments on bulk samples performed elsewhere. The bright sulfide grains seen at the sulfur K-edge correlate with an Fe 2+ species seen at 7120eV, this confirms the presence of a number of iron sulfide grains within the wood cells. The difference between the two iron maps shows that the Fe 3+ phase exists within the inner cell wall structure. A comparison with the organo-sulfur map shows that this iron is not well correlated with sulfur.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows sample spectra obtained from various locations within the wood cell structure using the X-ray microscope. These show that the sulfide grains have a S K-edge maxima at 2469.5eV, which we interpret as having a sulfur valency equal to -1.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> . The corresponding Fe spectra show some similarity to that of pyrite or pyrrhotite, but with some noticeable differences. The valency is +2, however the presence of a strong pre-edge peak and shifts in the position of the major maxima and minima above the edge suggest a more complex species than a pure iron sulfide. We have yet to identify what this is.</p><p>The sulfur species in the mid-lamella regions has a maximum at 2472.0eV, equivalent to a sulfur valency of +0.2. The Fe K-edge spectra in the inner cell walls matches well to the key features in goethite. From this we can conclude that the wood cells can contain a number of iron sulfide grains, but that the majority of the iron species is contained within the cell walls, probably in a hydroxylated iron oxide form with the majority of the sulfur bound in a slightly oxidised form and largely within the mid-lamella.</p><p>As a result of the experiment in this beamtime, we have been successful in understanding more of the role that iron apparently plays in the oxidation of sulfur in marine archaeological timbers. Our measurements on proposed treatment protocols were less fruitful, but provided valuable insights into improvements in our experimental methods for future studies on this aspect. Some of the results we have obtained are being combined with other data in a paper we are currently submitting to J.Arch.Sci. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> .  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Dr A.D.Smith -CCLRC Daresbury Laboratory Dr A.M.Jones -Mary Rose Trust, Portsmouth Dr T.Skinner -National Museums of Scotland, Edinburgh Report:</figDesc></figure>
