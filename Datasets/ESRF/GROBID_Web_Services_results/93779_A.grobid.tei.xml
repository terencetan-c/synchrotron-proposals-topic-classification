<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The goal of this beamtime was to make use of XANES and XMCD to study the magnetic and spectroscopic properties of single crystals of (Mo2/3RE1/3)2AlC (also called "i-MAX phase"), where RE = Ho and Dy. Preliminary bulk magnetisation measurements had been conducted, and revealed complex behaviour, with multiple metamagnetic transitions along the easy magnetisation axis a, which called for a follow-up element specific study. Since Mo atoms lie within the RE planes, we wondered if they would be exchange coupled with the RE atoms. In the case of Ce4473, a parent nano-laminar system, no magnetic moments on Mo was observed.</p><p>In the first step, a magnetic field strong enough to saturate the magnetic moments was applied along the easy axis of the single crystals, and XANES and XMCD spectra were recorded at the L3,2-edges of the RE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> (a) ) and Mo (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 (b</ref>) ) on Dy and Ho i-MAX. On both compounds, there is an intense XMCD signal at the L3,2-edges of Mo, which proves that there is indeed a magnetic moment on the Mo atoms. We then proceeded to set the energy at the energy position of an XMCD peak and swept the magnetic field, so as to obtain element-specific magnetisation curves on the RE and Mo (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The RE magnetisation is following the behaviour of the bulk magnetisation, as could be expected. The magnetisation of the Mo atoms is in turn following the RE, which tells us that the moment on Mo is induced by its proximity with the RE, as opposed to being the result of a Mo magnetic sublattice that would be uncoupled with the RE. In the light of this, it is interesting to note that the magnitude of the XMCD peaks at Mo L3 on Dy or Ho i-MAX is quite different (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1 (b)</ref> ), which hints at variations in the coupling with the Mo depending on the RE element.</p><p>We then made use of the magneto-optical sum rules to determine the orbital and spin magnetic moments of the Mo atoms, which gives us an opportunity to go a step further in the study of the couplings at play in these compounds. Indeed, the relative orientation of the orbital and spin moments on Mo and the RE hint at an unusual coupling scheme, where the 4f moments of the RE would interact directly with the 4d spin of Mo, instead of being mediated by the RE 5d orbital, as is usually believed to be the case. These results, along with bulk measurements, soft x-ray XAS and inelastic neutron scattering measurements were combined and analysed together, and led to the redaction of an article that will be submitted soon. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Normalized L3,2-edges XANES (left axis) and XMCD (right axis, same scale as XANES) spectra measured at T = 2.7K on the RE (a) and Mo (b) elements of Ho and Dy i-MAX.(a) (b)</figDesc><graphic coords="2,310.50,473.70,234.35,246.15" type="bitmap" /></figure>
