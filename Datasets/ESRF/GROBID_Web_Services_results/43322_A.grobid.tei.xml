<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The aim of the proposed experiment was to investigate the structure-activity relationship of a CuO-CeO 2 /Al 2 O 3 catalyst in propane total oxidation by an in-situ method, combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Cu K and Ce L 3 edge and on-line catalytic measurements using mass spectrometry (MS). A new in-situ/operando XAS cell/plug-flow micro-reactor was developed at the Laboratory for Chemical Technology of Ghent University for this purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiments performed</head><p>The reactor setup was successfully installed at the BM26A sample stage. With undiluted catalyst loaded into a reactor capillary of 0.8 mm outer diameter, good quality XAS spectra were obtained: for Ce LIII edge, XANES was measured up to k = ~ 4 Å -1 , while for Cu K edge EXAFS was recorded to k = ~ 8 Å -1 . Gasphase compositions were obtained, using a calibrated MS (Omnistar TM ). Typically, the reaction temperature was varied between RT and 723 K, with total flow rates in the range 3.5-10.5 ml/min. Powder reference materials for Cu (CuO, Cu 2 O and Cu) and Ce (CeO 2 and CeF 3 ) were measured in capillary and in pellet form. For both Cu and Ce, isothermal experiments were performed consisting of catalytic red/ox cycles with propane/He and oxygen/He respectively. Further, total oxidation reactions were carried out under simultaneous flow of propane and oxygen with ratio 1:10 for 3 space times at 3 temperatures. Finally, temperature programmed reduction (TPR) experiments using 5%H 2 /He were equally performed.</p><p>Isothermal red/ox experiments Isothermal reduction/oxidation cycles were performed with 5% C 3 H 8 /He and 20% O 2 /He respectively, up to 673K (400°C). The Ce edge started showing effect of the propane reduction at the highest temperature 673 K, while for Cu, changes were already obvious at 623 K on (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, oval indications). Total oxidation experiments As expected, the XAS measurements during total oxidation showed no changes. From the MS measurements, the conversion of propane could be obtained as function of space time. From these results, an Arrhenius plot was made yielding an apparent activation energy of 68.74 KJ/mol (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2. Propane conversion at total oxidation reaction conditions (left) and related Arrhenius plot (right).</head><p>H 2 -TPR experiments The stepwise TPR measurements with 5% H 2 /He showed reduction of the catalyst from T = 473-523K (200-250°C) on. This was evident not only in the Cu K XANES, but also in the Ce LIII XANES, indicating that in this mixed oxide catalyst, the CeO 2 compound is equally reduced at low temperature (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>; arrow indicates evolution upon reduction). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Cu K (left) and Ce LIII XANES (right) for isothermal red/ox cycles (5% C 3 H 8 /He and 20% O 2 /He, resp.);</figDesc></figure>
