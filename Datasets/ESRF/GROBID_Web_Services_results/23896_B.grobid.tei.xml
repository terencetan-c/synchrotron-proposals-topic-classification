<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>resolution x-ray diffraction methods (HRXRD). The Ge-nanocrystals forming in 4H-SiC(0001) substrates wafer after implantation and annealing with sizes under 5 nm are from specially interest. The current nanocrystals forming process has been advanced by supplementary implantation of Xe ions. For this, the former successful methods of the crystal characterization used, in recent periods of HRXRD measurements [June 2001/ February 2002] at the CRG-beamline ROBL BM 20, shall be applied once more. Additional investigations are required to clear up the recently observed angle shift of the Ge-reflections. Is this caused by any impurities with Si or by hydrostatic strain inside of the Ge-nanocrystals. Therefore the stoichiometric composition of Ge-nanocrystals should be determined with measurements at different wavelengths apart and in the vicinity of the Ge-K-absorption-edge. This allows an distinction between Ge respectively Si contribution in the diffractograms in consequence of the changing the x-ray atomic scattering factor f of Ge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples</head><p>Ge + ions with an energy of 250keV were implanted into 4H-SiC(0001) crystal wafers produced and supplied by Cree Research Inc. The implantation temperature was kept at 700°C. The ion current density was less than 1 µAcm -2 . Samples were tilted about 6°-8° to the ion beam to avoid channeling effects during implantation. The ion fluency of 1*10 16 cm -2 we used causes a Ge peak concentration of approximately 1 at.% in the deepness of 105nm below the surface. Thermal annealing was carried out at temperatures up to 1600°C in Ar-atmosphere (pressure 20kPa) using a rapid thermal annealing machine. The samples were placed between two electrically heated graphite stripes. To prevent significant decomposition, the annealing process was done with a sample arrangement face-to-face to an unimplanted SiC piece <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Ge-nanocrystals in 4H-SiC with sizes under 5 nm are most interesting for applications. Up to our knowledge these nanocrystals have not yet been realized. A new procedure of preparation has been applied to our samples. Xe ions with a very high energy of 390 MeV at 20°C and a dose of 1*10 14 cm -2 have been implanted in the samples after theirs primarily implantation and annealing process of Ge + ions as described above. This procedure should activate the Ge-nanocrystals formation inside of the crystalline SiC matrix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Characterization</head><p>The x-ray diffraction experiments carried out at ROBL can be separated in two parts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Firstly, characterization of Ge-nanocrystals formed in SiC samples after implantation with Xe ions</head><p>Samples which was implanted with Ge + ions and annealed at 1600°C have been shown a significant 111-Ge diffraction peak. The occurrence of 111-Ge diffraction peaks in the XRD pattern of the annealed samples indicate the formation of Ge crystallized inside the SiC samples. After the added implantation of Xe the 111-Ge diffraction peak was not more observed. Obviously, the Ge-nanocrystals disappear in samples which have been implanted with Xe ions after the implantation and annealing process of Ge + ions. Furthermore, the upper layer of the substrate was strong destroyed because of the implantation of Xe ions with a very high energy of 390 MeV. The reflections of substrate were split up in many peaks. Therefore a determination of the inherent strain in the crystalline substrate was very difficult.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Secondly, investigations to clear up the observed angle shift of the Ge-reflections</head><p>It is obvious that the measured maximum of the 111-Ge diffraction peak is located at 2θ=28.2°. Compared to the theoretical value for crystalline Ge (2θ=27.3°) this means a significant shift of the Bragg angle toward the value for crystalline Si (2θ=28.4°). We can discuss two possible reasons for this behavior. The Ge-nanocrystals could be added impurities of Si atoms. On the one hand, the XRD measurements cover a sample area of nearly 1 mm 2 and for that a large volume of implanted SiC. The measurement represents an average of all crystallites in that area, including crystallites with different chemical composition. On the other hand, the shift of the Bragg angle can be caused by strain in the crystallites. The observed shift corresponds to a change of the lattice constant of ∆a/a=3.1*10 -2 . Therefore, the stoichiometric composition of Ge-nanocrystals should be determined with measurements at different wavelengths apart and in the vicinity of the Ge-K-absorption-edge. This allows an distinction between Ge respectively Si contribution in the diffractograms in consequence of the changing the x-ray atomic scattering factor f of Ge. Because the size of the nanocrystals are smaller as the extinction distance therefore we can use the kinematical approximation. The reflected intensity I is proportional to | F hkl | 2 in the case of the kinematical approximation. For Ge in the diamond structure we have following terms: Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the absolute value of the quadratic x-ray scattering factor F 111 for Ge and Si in the vicinity of the Ge-K-absorption-edge (E = 11,103keV).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) ( ) [ ] 1 4 32 ) sin ( 2 2 2 1 0 2 ± = + + + + = n l k h für f f f F hkl λ θ f 0 -</formula><p>Considering the wavelengths and the anomalous dispersions corrections of the structure factor (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), the ratio of the integrated reflectivity between a Ge-reflection at 10.3 keV and a Ge-reflection at 11.1 keV for a pure Ge-crystal (in the case of the kinematical approximation) is 1to1.631. The fitted peak areas can be used to calculate the ratio of the integrated reflectivity between the Ge-nanocrystals peak at 10.3 keV and the peak at 11.1 keV. 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 Intensity measurements at 11.1keV / 2θ = 20.2° measurements at 10.3keV / 2θ = 21.8° fit of the measurements at 11.1keV fit of the measurements at 10.3keV (2 sinω)/λ The evaluation of the x-ray diffraction measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) obtained by Ge-nanocrystals grown on 6H-SiC(0001) results a ratio of 1 to 1.594≤0,026. Hence, these Ge-nanocrystals consists in 84%≤10% of Germanium.</p><p>The assessment of the Ge-nanocrystals produced in 4H-SiC by implantation of Ge + -ions and subsequent rapid thermal annealing is more difficult because the reflected intensity of the 111-Ge diffraction peak is very low and the thus ratio of the line -underground is dramatically decreases. (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>)</p><p>This investigation has shown that the stoichiometric composition of Ge-nanocrystals can be determined with measurements at different wavelengths apart and in the vicinity of the Ge-K-absorption-edge. But for the determination of the stoichiometric composition of Ge-nanocrystals has been produced in 4H-SiC by implantation of Ge + -ions and subsequent rapid thermal annealing the method have to advance to the limit of the resolution.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>atomic scattering factor of Ge f 1 -real part of the dispersion correction of the atomic scattering factor of Ge f 2 -imaginary part of the dispersion correction of the atomic scattering factor of Ge</figDesc></figure>
