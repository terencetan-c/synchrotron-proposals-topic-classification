<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of the beamtime was to demonstrate electrically detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy as a new method for investigating nanostructures. To this end, we fabricated samples with electrically contacted single GaInP semiconductor nanowires, as well as a sample holder which fit the sample stage at ID-16B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A-B</ref>) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The nanowires have highly n-doped ends, with an undoped and highly resistive middle segment. We connected a voltage source and a sensitive current amplifier to the sample holder, and aligned the device in the Xray nanofocus (about 90 nm diameter). Two X-ray fluorescence (XRF) detectors were used simultaneously and put as close as possible to the sample.</p><p>First, 2D raster scans were collected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) with a constant bias voltage. The Au XRF signal comes from the contacts, and the Ga XRF signal from the nanowire, as expected. The X-ray beam induced conductance (XBIC) signal is only generated in the central segment, since this segment dominates the resistance and therefore has a high electric field. Typical currents were in the pA range. The absorbed X-rays excites non-equilibrium electron-hole pairs which contribute to the conductivity, as shown in previous experiments <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The spatial resolution is similar to the beam size.</p><p>These results show how X-rays can be used to probe the electronic properties of nanodevices with high spatial resolution. Similar measurements can be done with an electron beam, but X-rays have other properties that can be exploited. One of them is the ability to use a monochromatic beam to excite specific elements near an X-ray absorption edge. We performed such energy-resolved measurements around the Ga Kedge, using ID-16B's unique ability to energy scan with a stable nanofocus. We could simultaneously collect spectra using XBIC and traditional XRF, which was the goal of the beamtime, and observed a clear enhancement of the XBIC signal as the energy crossed the edge. The data needs further analysis, which was not completed within the short time since the beamtime, but the XRF and XBIC showed qualitative similarity.</p><p>In a second set of experiments we investigated Zn-doped nanowires using XRF. Zn is used for p-doping III-V semiconductors, and control of the level and spatial distribution of doping is crucial for the performance of e.g. solar cells. Unfortunately, characterization of Zn-doping is notoriously difficult in nanostructures, since the concentration is only on the order of 10 -5 to 10 -3 . Electrical measurements of Hall-type usually fail since it is very difficult to make ohmic contacts. Electron beam methods fail since they generate too high background signal, but XRF has shown promising results <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</p><p>We investigated two types of nanowires: p-i-n doped InP nanowires, which were grown for solar cell applications, and p-doped GaInP nanowires, which had nominally homogenous composition. Both nanowires were grown using a Au seed particle, which was still present at the tip.</p><p>In the InP nanowires, we successfully detected Zn at the base of the nanowire (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 A</ref>,<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Note that we used a monochromatic beam (dE/E~10 -4 ), since this was required for the XBIC measurements, although a pink beam (dE/E~10 -2 ) should give around 100 times stronger signal. It has previously not been possible to measure the Zn doping in such nanowires. We suspected that the Zn doping would give a strong memory effect, extending the p-doping throughout the i-region, but doesn't seem to be the case.</p><p>In the GaInP nanowire, we found that the Ga concentration increased towards the top, while the In concentration reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 C</ref>,<ref type="figure">D</ref>). This has previously been observed using electron beam methods. However, here we were also able to measure the Zn concentration. The line scan shows that the Zn concentration is closely correlated with the Ga concentration. The measurements also show that the Zn concentration was significantly higher in the GaInP nanowires than in the InP nanowires. Further analysis is needed to remove background signals and quantify the absolute Zn concentrations.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that spectroscopic XBIC-measurements can be used to investigate individual nanostructures. The XBIC signal gives information about local electronic properties, and with the latest X-ray optics the spatial resolution could be pushed below 10 nm <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Compared with electron beams, X-rays have a number of interesting additional opportunities, such as long penetration depths for investigation of complete devices, and time-resolved measurements using the synchrotron pulses.</p><p>[1]</p><p>J Wallentin, M Osterhoff, T Salditt: In operando X-ray diffraction reveals electrically induced strain and bending in single nanowire device Adv.
