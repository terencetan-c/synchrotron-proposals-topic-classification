<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The aim of our experiment was twofold: obtain further insight into the structure of giant calix <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>arene tetrasulfonate supramolecular complexes and a screening of their stability and formation domains. We are greatful for the beamtime allocated at ID-29, as the facility offered extremely brilliant optics and fast data gathering (ideal for our weakly diffracting crystals) and a high throughput system, of which we were able to take full advantage. This was the main task to be done, since the experiments are clearly impossible using laboratory X-ray sources. Crystals can however be screened in the laboratory, since it is possible to determine the unit cells and crystal quality. The feasibility was checked during test runs at the ESRF.</p><p>To this extent we have prepared 90 samples of various compositions to take full advantage of the experimental facilities at ID29. We managed to scan around 60/90 samples prepared during our 24 hour shift. Up until now the structure solution of giant calixarene/guanidinium or diaminoguanidinium architectures with unit cell volumes up to 150000 3 has not yet succeeded. However, diffraction resolution up to 0.9 resolution with good indexation were obtained and we are continuing with the data processing and structure solution. It should be noted that such data quality proved illusive by using other X-ray sources, such as our laboratory setup (2.5 ) or the SOLEIL synchrotron (1.5-2 ). Furthermore, we observed similar superstructures for aminoguanidinium and diaminoguanidinium. In Table <ref type="table">1</ref> (see below) the cells in green represent good data sets for the giant supramolecular calix[4]arene:guanidinium:amine 1:4:1 architectures.</p><p>In 24h of beamtime we managed to obtain 2TB of data (~50 datasets). Currently, we are still processing the data obtained and aligning our IT facilities to match the standards of ID29 ESRF. Several supramolecular architectures with smaller unit cells were routinely solved.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Samples prepared for the 24h beamtime. Green cells indicate the formation of a giant supramolecular architectures (cell volumes of approx.. 137000 3 ).</p></div>
