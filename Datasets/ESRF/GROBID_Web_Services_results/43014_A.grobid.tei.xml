Grenoble, France Prof. STIRLING William G. *, E.S.R.F. Grenoble, France Dr. ZOCHOWSKI Stanley W. *, U.C.L., London, UK Mr. CHIVALL James*, U.C.L., London, UK</p><p>The light actinides exhibit some of the most intriguing properties of all the elements. Bulk alpha-uranium is rare in being a single-element system exhibiting a charge-density wave (CDW) ground-state. The rearrangement of charge at low temperature is accompanied by a periodic lattice displacement, and observed by the appearance of satellite-peaks in the diffraction patterns obtained from neutron or X-ray scattering. CDW-like stripe order is seen in high-transition-temperature superconducting cuprates, and the CDW ground state is thought to compete with the superconducting transition. As the transition involves a distortion of the lattice, the epitaxial constraint in thin-film systems is likely to suppress the CDW transition, and might then lead to an increase in the superconducting transition temperature. Previous experiments on the XMaS beamline (BM28) at the ESRF have investigated the effect of thickness on the CDW observed in thin-films of alpha-uranium grown with the [110]-direction perpendicular to the substrate surface. The films were grown by magnetron sputtering in UHV at Oxford University, with a Nb buffer layer used to seed growth of alpha-uranium on the A-plane of sapphire substrates. No CDW had previously been observed in films grown [002] on a W buffer.</p><p>A mesh-scan in the K-L plane around the (2.5 0 5) lattice position on revealed the presence of CDW satellites in a 2000 Å [002]-oriented film at (2.5 0±0.18 5±0.16), along with a large feature at (2.5 0 5) [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>]. This central feature appears at an unallowed position in reciprocal space, but its clear temperature dependence [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>] is persuasive evidence that it is not merely spurious.</p><p>The thermal expansion of alpha-uranium exhibiting a CDW shows a minimum in the lattice parameter at the onset of the CDW state. The temperature-dependence of the (006) lattice peak [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>] shows no lattice contraction on heating, but exhibits an anomalous expansion around the temperature of the expected CDW transition. Further diffraction experiments are planned to investigate the transition responsible for the anomalous thermal expansion of the lattice, along with the presence of the disallowed peak.</p><p>Further to alpha-uranium films, single-crystal films of UO 2 have been grown by RF-sputtering on substrates of CaF 2 . Due to the excellent lattice match between the substrate and the film, the presence and crystallinity of the oxide film is difficult to verify using X-ray diffraction. By scanning in energy around the uranium M4 absorption edge, it is possible to differentiate between scattering from the uranium and from the substrate. Observation of diffraction anomalous fine-structure (DAFS) from the uranium shows that the broad feature in   a longitudinal scan around the expected lattice position is due to the uranium, and that the crystallinity of the UO 2 layer is too poor to observe magnetic scattering [Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>].</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 -</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1-A section of the (2.5 K L) plane in the reciprocal lattice of a 2000 Å alpha-uranium sample grown in the [002] orientation on W.
