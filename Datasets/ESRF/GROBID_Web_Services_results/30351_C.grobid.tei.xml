<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Iterative Target Test Factor Analysis /1/ was used previously to characterize the gold nanoparticles formed on the cells and S-layer protein of B. sphaericus JG-A12 using H 2 as reducing agent. The results demonstrated that only 67% and 37% of the Au(III) was reduced to Au(0) on the cells and S-layer protein of this bacterium, respectively /2/. The present study was undertaken in order to optimize the Au reduction process using another reducing agent dimethyl amino borane (DMAB).</p><p>EXPERIMENTAL. B. sphaericus JG-A12 cells were grown in a batch culture to mid exponential phase and harvested by centrifugation. The preparation of S-layer protein was performed as described in /3/. For sorption of Au(III), 15 mg of dialysed protein and 20 mg of cells, were incubated in 150 ml and 30 ml of a solution of 2 mM HAuCl 4 x 3H 2 O, respectively. After 3 hours incubation at room temperature under shaking in the darkness the samples were centrifuged (20 min, 10000 × g) and the pellets were resuspended in H 2 O. Residual salts were removed by dialysis of the metallized proteins and cells against H 2 O. Au(III) was reduced by the addition of DMAB to produce Au(0)-nanoparticles. The metallized cells and protein samples were centrifuged (20 min, 10000 × g) and dried in a vacuum oven (48h, 80°C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS.</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the XANES regions of the EXAFS spectra obtained with Au-treated S-layer and cells after addition of DMAB and for reference compounds containing two oxidation states of gold: Au(III) (solution of 2 mM HAuCl 4 x 3H 2 O) and metallic Au (gold foil). Comparison of the experimental spectra to the reference spectra clearly shows that Au is present mainly as metallic Au in the Au-treated S-layer and cells. To determine the relative amounts of Au(0) and Au(III) present in the biological samples, we applied Iterative Transformation Factor Analysis. The calculation revealed a mixture of 89% metallic Au and 11% Au(III) for the Au-loaded cells sample and 81% metallic Au and 19% Au(III) for the S-layer sample.</p><p>Gold L III -edge EXAFS spectra of cells and S-layers of B. sphaericus JG-A12 in presence of DMAB are shown together with Au foil in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. In these samples Au is present mainly as metallic phase where the interatomic distances found are comparable with the one of metallic foil. The coordination numbers (N) are diffrent from the bulk ones, showing the presence of small metal particles. The reduction of the coordination number of the first shell is used to estimate the average particle. The coordination number value of the Au-Au found in this work ( 8.7 ± 0.3 for the S-layer and 6.3 ± 0.4 for the cells sample ) is not the real coordination number of the Au per nanoparticles. This va lue correspond to the coordination number of Au-Au per sample. The coordination number of later bond per nanoparticle is weighted by the atomic percentage of Pd atoms in the metallic phase. Using the cubic (FM3-M) structure of elemental gold , the average cluster size was estimated. It was found that the nanoparticles deposited on the cells and S-layer protein have a mean diameter of about 0.6 -0.8 nm and 1.5-2.5 nm, respectively.   3 6 9 12 15 18 -200 0 0 2 4 6 8 -18 0 Au foil Cells S-layer data fit EXAFS [k 3* chi(k)] k [ Å -1</p><p>] Au: 1.2 @ 4.10 Å Au: 2.9 @ 4.09 Å Au: 7.1 @ 4.06 Å Au: 6.3 @ 2.88 Å Au: 8.7 @ 2.88 Å Au: 12.5 @ 2.87 Å FT magnitude</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R + ∆ [Å]</formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>absorption spectroscopy studies on gold nanoparticles formed by bacteria and their surface layer proteins Local contact(s ): Dr. Andre Rossberg Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Merroun* M., Rossberg* A., Hennig* C., Funke, H., Scheinost* A.C., S.Selenska-Pobell Institute of Radiochemistry, Forschungszentrum Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany Report: ABSTRACT. Cells and S-layer sheets of B. sphaericus JG-A12 were used as templates for the deposition of metallic gold nanoclusters using dimethyl amino borane (DMAB) as reducing agent . Gold L III -edge XAS measurements confirmed the formation of Au(0) nanoclusters in both cases.</figDesc></figure>
