<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>One of the aims of our experiment carried out on ID21 beamline in November 2000 was the in situ characterization of the porous structure of aqueous clay gels. Indeed, X-Ray microscopy allows to investigate much larger scales than those probed by scattering techniques. A secondary aim was to get a better understanding of the role and status of calcium ions in controlling the aggregation behaviour of clay minerals and the fabric of clay-polysaccharide aggreggates.</p><p>First experiments carried out at the Ca K absorption edge were unsatisfactory mainly because of the ubiquituous presence of calcium impurities in all the polymer windows tested. We then shifted to lower energies, working at 2.5 keV in order to perform a mapping of silicon atoms, (main components of clay minerals) through their fluorescence yield. Despite some experimental difficulties associated with the use of secondary vacuum, high quality images of montmorillonite clay gels could be obtained using such set-up (Figures <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). with aligned domains richer in silicon (3 to 8 µm wide) alternating with Si-poor zones (5 to 30 µm wide) corresponding to water domains. Some water pockets with a non-lamellar morphology can be observed in zones where different clay-rich lamellae end. The silicon-rich objects are at least two orders of magnitude larger than the size of the elementary clay layers which are polydisperse between 0.1 and 0.8 µm. This image therefore represents the first direct experimental evidence for the existence of a superstructure in montmorillonite gels. It must be stressed out that this orientational order is not directly due to individual clay platelets but to "packs" of clay layers, the structure of which remains to be determined.</p><p>A second image (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) obtained on a second montmorillonite gel with the same concentration, using identical acquisition parameters as the previous image, reveals similar oriented domains of silicon-rich lamellae alternating with water domains. However, in this case, orientational defects can clearly be observed.</p><p>Two main types of defects can be distinguished : (i) bundles of lamellae secant to other bundles with an angle of around 110° (arrows 1 and 2); (ii) kink-folded structures affecting silicon-rich lamellae (arrows 3 and 4) that are typical of sheared structures observed in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  20 µm 1 3 2 4 20 µm</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>Figure 1 shows the silicon fluorescence yield image obtained on a first montmorillonite gel. It has been rebuilt from 4 different scans (100µm by 100µm with a resolution of 1µm and a dwell time of 400ms) The most striking feature of this image is the presence of long range orientational order (= 200 µm)</figDesc></figure>
