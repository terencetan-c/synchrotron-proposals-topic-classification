<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In personal care products, there are several polymers and surfactants that are only used to give the product its desired structure. Because fossil fuels, used to make these materials, are becoming scarce, it has been suggested that instead oxidised cellulose could be used as a rheology modifier in these products. It has been found that C6-partially oxidised cellulose forms gels with salt and surfactants. In this project it is our task to find out why these gels form.</p><p>In this experiment we studied the structure of cellulose-salt and cellulose-surfactant gels. We had three days to perform this experiment, so the first day we performed static X-ray scattering experiments, on approximately 350 samples. These samples contained 2 component mixtures of cellulose (4 or 8 g L -1 ) and salts (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, CsCl and NH 4 Cl), cellulose and clays or cellulose and the surfactant sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES).</p><p>We studied the SLES samples at two different temperatures, 25 and 50°C. The scattering of static 3 and 4 components gels (cellulose-clay-salt and cellulose-clay-salt-surfactant) were also measured during this experiment.</p><p>The second part of the experiment we used to follow the X-ray scattering of the gels under shear. For these experiments, we prepared 2 component gels with cellulose and salt or cellulose and surfactant. We used the whole shear rate range possible on the rheometer. Due to the large amount of data generated in three days, we will focus in this report on scattering from cellulose and salts, since by using different ions we tried to use contrast variation to understand gel formation by cellulose with salt in more detail.</p><p>We used five different kind of salts (LiCl, NaCl, KCl, CsCl and NH 4 Cl) and studied two different concentrations: 0.2 and 0.3 M. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the scattering curves of 4 g L -1 cellulose with these different salts are shown. In this figure, one can clearly see that there is a trend as function of the atomic number of the counterions. However, this trend was less prominent for the other cellulose concentrations. This may be explained by the capillaries having different thicknesses so our next step will be to correct for the thickness of the capillaries.</p><p>After that we will fit these scattering curves with the form factor of a flexible cylinder with an ellipsoidal core. This form factor has been used to fit the scattering curves of cellulose alone and we expect that it will also fit the scattering curves of the cellulose gels with salt.</p><p>In the second part of the experiment we performed RheoSAXS measurements. We already knew that these gels are shear thinning, which can also be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, where the rheology data (viscosity as function of the shear rate) are shown. We hoped to get some insight of what is happening to the structure of the gel by measuring the small angle X-ray scattering of the gel under shear.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> the scattering curves of as function of the shear rate are presented. The corresponding rheology data are the last 10 data points of figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> it can be seen that at the higher shear rates the sample shows some shear thickening; the viscosity increases. In figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref> the scattering curves at the higher shear rates have a slightly higher intensity at low q. These scattering measurements are certainly helping us to understand the properties of the gels and we are confident that they will form the basis of at least one article, but hopefully more. 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 10 -4 10 -3 10 -2 10 -1 10 0 γ ( s -1 ) q (nm -1 ) I (cm -1 ) Figure 2b: scattering curves of 4 g L -1 dialysed cellulose with 0.2M NaCl as function of the shear rate, X-ray beam in a radial position relative to the Couette cell. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Lindhoud* University of Bath, Claverton Down, BA2 7AY, Bath, UK</figDesc></figure>
