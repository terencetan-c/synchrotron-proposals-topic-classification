<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Application of high pressure alters the nature of chemical bonds, electronic and crystal structures, and thermal and mechanical properties of solids. It has also been suggested that simple molecular solids may transform into a polymeric phase before they become metals at high pressure. Theoretical models and experimental data support this hypothesis, including polymeric forms of N 2 , CO, diamond, β-C 3 N 4 , and symmetric-H 2 O. Furthermore, these pressure-induced changes often occur in systematic ways, providing new routes for designing and synthesizing novel materials with advanced optical and mechanical properties. The structures of the N 2 -polymer, diamond, and β-C 3 N 4 at high pressures, for example, can be viewed as similar to the assemblages of heavier elements of each periodic group, P, Si, β-Si 3 N 4 at low pressures, respectively.</p><p>In our recent Raman studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we have discovered an extended-solid phase, CO 2 -V, synthesized in a diamond-anvil cell by laser-heating the molecular orthorhombic phase, CO 2 -III, above 40 GPa and 1800 K. This new material can be quenched to ambient temperature above 1 GPa. The vibration spectrum of CO 2 -V is similar to that of the quartz polymorph of SiO 2 , indicating that it is an extended covalent solid with carbon-oxygen single bonds. This material is also optically nonlinear, generating the second harmonic of Nd:YLF laser at a wavelength of 527 nm with a conversion efficiency near 0.1 %.</p><p>The objective of the past run in FY98 at the ESRF was thus to characterize the crystal structure and its bulk mechanical property of CO 2 -V at high pressures. Because CO 2 is made of relatively low-Z elements and the product CO 2 -V is located in a small area of the sample at high pressures above 40 GPa, it was essential to use a highly bright synchrotron x-ray source available at the third generation synchrotron source. Furthermore, angle-resolved x-ray diffraction combinded with a fast scanning image-plate detector was very well suitable for characterizing highly preferably oriented crystal structures of CO 2 phases and determining their bulk properties such as the equation of state.</p><p>In this past run, by using the beamline ID-30 at the ESRF we have completed the structural analysis of seven samples: four samples being converted to CO 2 -V at various P,T conditions and three untransformed CO 2 -I and III samples. The diffraction patterns of various CO 2 phases, including CO 2 -I, III and V were obtained to 60 GPa as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a)</ref>, <ref type="figure">(b</ref>) and (c), respectively. In these experiments, the samples were rotated along the chi-direction of the diamond-anvil cell during x-ray exposure, which we found was essential to obtain high quality diffraction pattern from highly preferably oriented CO 2 particularly in the phases III and V. With these results, we were able to characterize the crystal structure of CO 2 -V for the first time and the bulk properties of CO 2 -I, III and V. Our major findings during this previous run are:</p><p>(i) CO 2 -III remains in a Cmca structure up to 60 GPa; prior to this study, the crystal structure of CO 2 -III had only been determined at the pressures between 8 and 11 GPa, in which conditions CO 2 -III always coexists with CO 2 -I.</p><p>(ii) CO 2 -V has indeed a quartz-like (P6 2 22) structure. This is the first example of a tetrahedrally bonded carbon-oxygen structure, which is the basic building block in many covalently bonded solids and minerals including β-SiO 2 quartz.</p><p>(iii) CO 2 -V is likely a superhard solid similar to cubic-BN; whereas, CO 2 -III may not be entirely molecular in its bonding characteristic. These results will be published in PRL <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
