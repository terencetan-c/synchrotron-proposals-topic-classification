<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Experimental setup. The experiment was performed at the ID13 microfocus hutch (EH-2) using a Fresnel lens with 200 µm aperture during hybrid machine operating mode. The monochromatic beam (λ=0.0982 nm) was focused at about 140 mm from the optics to a spot of ~600(h)*300(v) nm. A Frelon CCD detector with 2Kx2K pixels and 16 bit readout was used for data collection. The pixel size used for data analysis of the 2x2 binned detector is 101.7x100.7 µm 2 . The patterns were corrected for distortion and dark current. A grain of Ag-behenate was used for distance calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Data analysis was performed by Christian Riekel using FIT2D <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</p><p>Samples. Eosinophils were isolated from healthy donors/hypereosinophilic patients. Granules containing crystals were isolated from the cells with established methods, frozen and defrosted just before the measurements directly at the ESRF in Grenoble. Additionally, crystalline cores were extracted from granules upon treatment with a mild detergent (Triton 0.1%) and frozen in a cryoprotectant solution. Both granules and cores were thawed at the ESRF and spun in a table-top centrifuge, resuspended in a cryoprotectant solution and collected with a loop. We used both Mitigen Kapton loops as well as nilon loops. Silicon nitride membranes were employed for some experiments (Silson). In this case, the samples were applied over the membrane and dryed before freezing.</p><p>Results. We used MiTiGen Kapton loops for granules and isolated core-particle suspensions in ethylene glycol/sucrose/water mixtures. The diffraction patterns contained a significant amount of high energy scattering which will have to be reduced in future setups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). It was, however, possible to efficiently suppress the background by subtracting a pattern measured outside the loop. A single pattern with diffraction peaks is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>. Azimuthal integration reveals two orders corresponding to a 2.12 nm repeating unit (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). A composite of all the images acquired on an isolated cores sample is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>. As evident from visual inspection, several diffracting particles can be identified. The logarithmic intensity plot of a single pattern shows two orders of diffraction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). The azimuthal integration process is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>.</p><p>The 1D intensity profile containing the 1 st order peak has been fitted with a Gaussian peak and a 0-order polynomial background (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). The 1 st order lattice spacing shows a variability across a few analyzed patterns of d=3.43 (± 0.05 nm). The two peaks are attributed to in-plane spacings of the stacked crystalline eosinophil sheets. The sheets must aggregate to stacks of a certain thickness so that the peaks become observable by X-ray diffraction. The observation of 2.12/1.06 peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>) suggests 3D lattice order and an epitaxial stacking. Whether the aggregation step occurs during the separation of the core-particles from the granules or during the drying of core-particle suspension on the hydrophobic SiN membranes is not clear at present. In addition, we measured the radiation stability of the diffracting particles. The decay of the 3.43 nm peak at 100 K was determined by a loop-scan with 10 s exposure per pattern. The sample loses its crystallinity without evidence for the transition into an intermediary phase. A half-time of decay of about 75 s is obtained. Preliminary conclusions. The current data on human eosinophil crystals reveal a lattice spacing of d=3.43 nm. This can be attributed to an in-plane spacing of stacked crystalline sheets in view of the aggregatemorphology. A further lattice spacing of d=2.12 nm does not agree with an in-plane spacing. The fact that this lattice spacing is not present for the isolated cores but only for the granules could be due to the more random orientation of granules. If the 2.12 nm spacing would be due to the separation of thin lattice planes observed in TEM data 3 , one might be able to observe this by rotating the core particle containing membrane to 90° at the beamline. We could detect 2 nd orders to the 3.43 and 2.12 reflections. Other reflections have, however, not yet been observed. The quality of the present data will have to be improved by averaging over several patterns and performing oscillation experiments, which seem feasible given the relative stability of the specimen in this setup.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
