<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments reported here (SC-885, 2 nd and 3 rd allocation periods) are related to point 4 of the experimental programme in the Long Term Project SC-885: force generation in muscle is driven by transition between states with different degree of tilting of the light chain domain of the myosin head (Rayment et al., Science 261:58-65, 1993). To test this idea we collected the X-ray diffraction pattern during isometric contractions at different temperatures (0-17 °C). In fact, the recent mechanical demonstration with unprecedented precision that, in an intact muscle fibre, the temperature changes the force per myosin head without affecting the fraction of attached force-generating heads (Linari et al. Pflügers Arch. 442:R65/38, 2001), makes this procedure ideal for the structural test. During the previous LS-1403, the vertical collimation of the X-ray beam at ID2 allowed changes in the fine structure of the M3 reflection, due to X-ray interference between the two arrays of myosins in each thick filament to be measured (Linari et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 97, <ref type="bibr">[7226]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7227]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7228]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7229]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7230]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7231]</ref><ref type="bibr">2000)</ref>. Thus we determined the axial movement of the heads during the execution of the working stroke that drives the actin filament towards the centre of the myosin filament (Piazzesi et al., Nature, 415, <ref type="bibr">[659]</ref><ref type="bibr">[660]</ref><ref type="bibr">[661]</ref><ref type="bibr">[662]</ref><ref type="bibr">2002)</ref>. Interference data collected during LS-1403 showed that an increase of the temperature from 0 °C to 11 °C, increasing the isometric tetanic force (T 0 ) by 36%, decreased the ratio (R) of the intensities of HA over LA peak of the M3 reflection by 20%. Reliable data on the temperature dependence of the intensity of the M3 reflection (IM3) could not be collected during LS-1403, because the spatial resolution necessary for interference measurements was only possible with the Image Plate detector and frames at different temperatures were separated by the long delay required for changing the Image Plate. In the experiments reported here we used the new CCD detector and could collect the intensity and fine structure of the meridional reflections as well as the intensity of the actin layer line reflections during isometric tetani at four different temperatures (0, 4, 10 and 17 °C).</p><p>Experimental protocol: Single fibres from the tibialis anterior muscle of Rana temporaria were vertically mounted in a trough containing Ringer solution at 4 °C and at ~2.2 µm sarcomere length between a force transducer and a loudspeaker coil motor as already described <ref type="bibr">(Linari et al., 2000)</ref>. Patterns were collected on the image intensified FReLoN CCD detector placed at either 10 m (to collect intensity and fine structure of the low order meridional reflections) or 3 m (to collect intensity of the higher order meridional reflections, up to M6, and of the actin layer lines). Data analysis was performed using Fit2D (by Dr A.P. Hammersley, ESRF) and Peakfit software package (SPSS Inc.). The radial integration limits were: ± 120 nm for the M3 and M6 reflections and from 21 to 4.8 nm for the 1 st actin layer line. Results: Increasing the temperature from 0 °C to 17 °C (that produced an increase in T 0 by 44%) (1) reduced R monotonically from 0.90 ± 0.02 (0 °C) to 0.75 ± 0.01 (17 °C) (mean ± SEM, 12 fibres, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1);</ref> (2) slightly increased IM3, that attained a maximum of 1.11 ± 0.08 at 10 °C (10 fibres); (3) increased the spacing of the M3 reflection (SM3, 14.568 nm at 0 °C) in proportion to the isometric force with a slope that was twice that estimated during the elastic response to rapid length changes (Piazzesi et al., 2002); (4) did not change significantly the intensity of M6 reflection; (5) increased the intensity of the 1 st actin layer line by 56 ± 18% (6 fibres). Changes in the fine structure of M3 reflection was interpreted using the tilting lever arm model of the myosin head and a structural model of the sarcomere with distributed filament compliance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Piazzesi et al., 2002)</ref>. The tilt of the light chain domain with increase in isometric force was equal to that expected from the increased strain in the filaments, provided that only half of the axially ordered heads are exerting the isometric force, as assumed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Piazzesi et al., 2002)</ref>. The productivity of ID2 for time-resolved X-ray diffraction/interference measurements on single muscle fibres increased by about ten times in 2002 due to the replacement of imaging plates by the FReLoN CCD detector.</p><p>Consequently in the 3 rd allocation period we were able to complete the temperature experiments and collect also preliminary data on another question at point 4 of the programme: the changes in myosin filament structure between resting and active muscle. Thanks to the increase in flux due to the second undulator, 2D patterns could be recorded with 5 ms resolution during the development of force and relaxation in the isometric tetanus. The effect of the activation was isolated from that of increase in force by imposing shortenings at the maximum velocity at different times after the beginning of stimulation. Further improvements in CCD design at ID2 are expected to allow even faster time framing in future experiments.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
