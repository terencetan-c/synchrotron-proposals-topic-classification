<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report:</p><p>Crystal structures of the crucial complex formed between complement C3d and Factor H SCR-19/20 revealed either a 1:1 or a 2:1 stoichiometry. To identify which stoichiometry was correct, online HPLC data collection was carried out on their mixtures in order to obtain SAXS data on their complex alone without either monomeric proteins present. First the individual proteins were measured using the online HPLC, then the mixture was studied. A 2.4 ml S-200 increase HPLC column was used.</p><p>SAXS data from SCR-19/20 alone from the online HPLC was consistent with previous SAXS measurements using the regular sample changer on BM29. The protein was eluted from the HPLC as a single peak (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The radius of gyration R G value was 2.50 ± 0.07 nm with a maximum dimension D max of 8.7 nm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>)  C3d alone was eluted as a single peak (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). The Guinier and P(r) analyses were in agreement with previous SAXS measurements. The R G value was 2.20 ± 0.06 nm and the D max value was calculated to be 7.5 nm (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>.)  A 1:2 molar ratio of the SCR-19/20 and C3d proteins was injected on the HPLC column. The resulting elution profile consisted of three resolved peaks (blue; Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Guinier and P(r) analyses were carried out on each of the three individual peaks.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. The C3d and SCR-19/20 mixture was measured using the online HPLC in a ~2:1 molar ratio (8.3 mg/ml C3d and 1.7 mg/ml SCR-19/20). Each of the three peaks gave similar R G values (~3 nm) and similar D max values (~10.4 nm). These values were similar to what had been observed when the mixture (complex and two monomers) were measured using the regular sample changer. Estimated mass calculations from the Porod volume indicated that, from left to right, the first peak corresponded to a mass of ~35-50 kDa, the second peak has a mass of ~40-60 kDa and the third peak has a mass of ~20-30 kDa. These values were comparable with the known molecular masses of C3d and SCR-19/20.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The elution profiles for the two separate proteins and their mixture successfully showed the expected single peaks for the free proteins and the expected three peaks for the mixture that corresponds to the free proteins and their complex. The observation of three peaks is attributable to the weak binding of C3d and SCR-19/20, meaning that peaks for the free and bound proteins will be present. What is not yet clear is whether a 1:1 or a 2:1 stoichiometry has been observed. This will only be resolved using a full concentration series and range of stoichiometries. We plan to repeat this experiment using the online HPLC on BM29, but will also collect data on the mixtures using the regular sample changer on BM29. Atomistic scattering modelling will be used to analyse the observed curves as the sum of the individual proteins and their two complexes, using the already known scattering curves for the individual proteins from crystallography.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Dunne, O.*, Nan, R.,* Pao, P.J.* &amp; Perkins, S.
