<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report of activity of MX386 at ID14.1</head><p>Data collections on XendoU crystals. Several data sets of crystals of a novel metal-dependent endoribonuclease from X. laevis (XendoU) were collected. We have already solved the structure of XendoU by MIR phasing, but we are still lacking information about the active site and the metal binding site. We have previously found an electron density peak in the putative active site that we attributed to a phosphate ion, as the crystals grew in phosphate buffer. During this beamtime we collected data sets of crystals soaked in bis-tris buffer at pH 5.5 and HEPES buffer at pH 7.0 to confirm the attribution of the electron density peak to a phosphate ion. Soaking was performed also in the presence of Mn 2+ ions and 5'UMP, an analogue of the substrate. One data set was also collected from a crystal of XendoU co-crystallised with an oligoribonucleotide of twenty bases mimicking the native substrate. Here we report the data collections statistics. The resolution of the collected data sets is quite poor. a.

However no metals, nor 5'UMP, nor oligo-ribonucleotide were detected in the maps, raising the question of a direct metal binding to the protein, and encouraging to repeat the experiment using 3'UMP and searching for different crystallization conditions (possibly with lower ionic strength). However the data coming from the crystal grown in the presence of the oligo-ribonucleotide were productive since they clearly showed electron density for a loop between amino acids 44-56 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), not visible in the native data. Data collections on CcmH crystals.</p><p>We are working on the structure of CcmH protein. At present the structure is under refinement and we are now trying to solve the structure of the reduced form of the protein.</p><p>In fact CcmH contains one disulphide bridge with a putative functional role in the maturation of c-type cytochrome in vivo. Our aim is to establish whether the protein undergoes structural rearrangement during the oxidation-reduction cycle.</p><p>We tested several crystals soaked with DTT at different concentrations (40 mM -2 mM). Many of these crystals did not diffract well probably due to the presence of the reducing agent. Finally we were able to collect one good data set of a CcmH crystal soaked with 5mM DTT for 3 hours.</p><p>CcmH (resolution 30.0-2.2 Å) Space group P21212 Unit cell dimensions (Å) a= 63.284, b=40.350, c= 63.956 Completeness (last shell) % 92.5 (85.1) Mosaicity 1.4 Rsym (last shell) 0.081 (0.258) Data collection of Glutathione-S Transferase from Ochrobactrum anthropi GST Data collection statistics Max resolution (Å) 3.0 Space group P6 1 22 Unit cell (Å) a=b=58.5940 c=212.3660 Mosaicity 0.45 Completeness 98.9 % Multiplicity 12.6 Rmerge 0.094 This is the first crystal of the GST from O. anthropi ever collected.
