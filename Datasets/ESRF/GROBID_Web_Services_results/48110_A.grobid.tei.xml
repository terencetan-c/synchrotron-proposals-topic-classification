<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Cataract, eye lens clouding due to light scattering, is a leading cause of blindness and can result from protein condensation in hyperthermic and stressful conditions i , when altered intermolecular interactions lead to dense phases that can compromise cell and organ function. Mammalian eye lens cells contain concentrated solutions of proteins called crystallins. Crystallins are divided in three main classes and crystallins. Among these, the most abundant are the -crystallins, which are capable of chaperon-like activity, the ability to bind unfolded proteins to avoid their aggregation and precipitation in cell. When and crystallin unfold during thermal, chemical or electromagnetic stress, they become substrates of alpha crystallin i . α-crystallin exhibits a phase transition at nearly T C =45 °C, involving a quaternary structural modification and enhanced or reorganized hydrophobic surfaces ii . Beyond this temperature it has been demonstrated an enhanced chaperon activity of the protein iii . Furthermore it has been shown that also ATP activates the chaperon activity iv . We therefore studied temperature and ATP effects on alpha crystallin quaternary structure and on its interactions with gamma and beta crystallin, as their impact on lens transparency in both physiological and in hyperthermic conditions is an important step towards cataract prevention. We have analyzed alpha crystallin behaviour at different Temperatures and we have seen a doubling in molecular weight of the protein beyond the Transition Temperature v . By means of the ab-initio software Dammin we have obtained tridimensional reconstructions of alpha crystallin and we have analyzed the anisometry of the quaternary structures (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Alpha crystallin has an ellipsoidal shape before and after transition, as can be deduced by tridimensional reconstructions v and by the higher values of anisometry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Interestingly, at 45°C the particle reaches the minimum value of anisometry which is a marker of a more spherical simmetry. Hence we have hypotesized a rearrangment of subunits prior the acquisition of the activated form at high temperature v . We also studied the effect of ATP on quaternary structure of alpha crystallin and on interactions with crystallins. We are currently analyzing interactions with crystallins. To obtain an overall shape analysis of alpha-gamma complexes (ratio 1:1 in concentration), we extrapolated P(R) distributions from SAXS data (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). General considerations about the shape of the protein can be deduced from the P(R): at 37°C both in presence and in absence of ATP, P(R) has a Gaussian shape indicating that the protein has a globular structure that is globally not influenced by the presence of the substrates. We are currently analyzing the structures at different temperatures, as we think that ATP could change the Tc value, stimulating an enhanced chaperone activity at lower temperatures. If we consider alpha and gamma crystallin mixtures we see that there aren't evident structural changes. We obtained reconstructions of alpha crystallin and alpha and gamma crystallin complexes in presence and absence of ATP with the ab initio software Dammin (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Alpha crystallin alone (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref> and <ref type="figure">3e</ref>) and in presence of ATP at 37°C (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref> and <ref type="figure">3f</ref>) shows almost an identic elliptical structure (NSD of aligned structures is 0.618). In presence of gamma crystallin (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref> and <ref type="figure">3g</ref>) and in presence of both gamma crystallin and ATP (3d and 3h) the structures shows subtle structural modifications that we are currently analyzing. We think that changing the ratio would lead to deeper structural modifications of the protein complex, and to determine the interaction potential between and crystallins. To achieve these necessary measurements, and to extend our results from suspensions to cytoplasmic extracts and lens, we submitted a proposal for SAXS beamline at ESRF on march 2012.</p><p>i Bloemendal H, de Jong W, Jaenicke R, Lubsen NH, Slingsby C, Tardieu A Prog.Biophys. <ref type="bibr">Molec.Biol.86, 407(2004)</ref> Ageing and vision: structure, stability and function of lens crystallins.</p><p>ii Regini, J.W., Grossmann, J.G., Burgio, M.R., Malik, N.S., Koretz, J.  <ref type="figure">(a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>,<ref type="figure">c</ref>,<ref type="figure">d)</ref> and <ref type="figure">lateral (e</ref>,<ref type="figure">f</ref>,<ref type="figure">g</ref>,<ref type="figure">h</ref>) view.
