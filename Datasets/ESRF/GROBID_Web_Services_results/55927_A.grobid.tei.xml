<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The GISAXS experiment had two major goals: (1) To extend our previous structural analysis of membrane fusion intermediate structures from protein-free lipid model systems as presented in [1] to a multilamellar system with reconstituted SNARE proteins, following the protein purification and reconstitution protocols presented in <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. (2) To extend the previous study to highly fusiogenic ("magic") lipid mixtures, which form stalks even in solution (as opposed to the stronger osmotic pressures imposed in humidity cells), based on the phase diagram studies reported in <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The investigated sample systems are tabulated in Tab.1.</p></div>

For incorporation of the SNARE protein complex, the sample preparation had to be implemented without the use of organic solvents, to avoid protein denaturation. Instead, the SNAREs were reconstituted by surfactant micelles (n-octyl-β-D-glucoside , n-OG), followed by extraction of n-OG in desalting columns, and finally deposition of multilamellar membranes on wafers by vesicle fusion. Surprisingly, this preparation yielded samples which are perfectly suitable for GISAXS, owing to their high orientational alignment.</p><p>As the data in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows, the lamellar ordering and phase state differed from samples prepared by the conventional deposition procedure from organic solvent following standard methods for protein-free membranes as used in [1], probably due to the fact that not all of the surfactants can be washed out of the bilayer. While this clearly complicates the ongoing analysis, the high number of control samples will hopefully lead to conclusive results regarding the effect of the SNARE proteins on the phase diagram and stalk structure in the lipid matrix. A second part of the beamtime was dedicated to highly fusiogenic mixtures, where non-lamellar phases were observed under much milder dehydration condition (which were controlled by osmotic stressor solution) than usual (data not shown, also work in progress).</p><p>[1] S.

Fig.2 Example of GISAXS diffraction pattern recorded for three different PC/PE/PS/CH samples, with columns representing (left) pure lipid mixture prepared by organic solvent spreading, (center) pure lipid mixture prepared by micellization method and (right) lipid mixture with reconstituted SNAREs prepared by micellization method, respectively. The three rows show data recorded for relative humidities RH 90%, RH 80% and RH 50%, respectively. Corresponding membrane periodicities of the multi-lamellar stacks are marked in the upper left corner of each image.</p><p>In general, samples from the solvent method exhibit more Bragg peaks indicative of higher long range order / less lamellar defects. Diffraction patterns of micelle-prepared samples also exhibit high orientation, but more lamellar disorder. The lamellar periodicity also changes, as well as the phase diagram. At RH 50% all samples are in a non-lamellar phase. Only for the pure lipids prepared by the conventional spreading from solvent, the expected rhombohedral (R) phase is observed. The structure changes upon incorporation of the SNARE proteins, but changes in structure are larger between the two different preparation methods.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: Sketch of the GISAXS geometry of the experiment carried out at the upgrade ID01 beamline, taking advantage of high brilliance, high beam stability and low background to investigate stalk formation with and without membrane fusion proteins.
