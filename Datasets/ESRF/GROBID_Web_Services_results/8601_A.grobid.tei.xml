<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>These experiments has lead us to very interesting results concerning the anharmonic potential of the different ions in the cubic phase. Indeed, whereas the Sr/Ba atoms lie in an harmonic potential (fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>) for all investigated compositions, we have observed in the PDF maps of the oxygens a splitting of the positions along the Ti -0 -Ti direction (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and a strong anharmonic potential maximum for the titanium atom indicating a shifting of the special position onto a disordered position distributed on the surface of a sphere (fig <ref type="figure">3</ref>), this latter trend disapears for the highest concentration of Ba (fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). These behaviours, characteristic of a positional disorder, are surprisingly interesting as pure SrTiOs is a very well known displacive system.</p><p>We have failed during this experiment on ID1 1 to extract reliable information on valence electrons due to the poor low Q data collection and also the absence of beam monitoring. However, using a 4-circles with a conventional molybdenium source and the anharmonic parameters deduced from the ID1 1 data collections, we have been able to obtain deformation maps of fair quality. Nevertheless the very strong extinction and absorption correction in theses compounds doesn't allow us to measure with a conventional source intensities of sufficient quality for joint multipole anharmonic refinements. This will be the subject of a new ESRF proposal.</p></div>		</body>
