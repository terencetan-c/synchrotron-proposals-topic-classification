<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The left graph shows detector scans at three different incident angles and resulting scattering depths: two peaks, associated with the hBN and cBN phase, are visible. The integrated intensities of the two reflections are roughly equal in the upper curve (entire film thickness) and differ by a factor of three in the curve in the middle (120 A scattering depth). The lattice spacing of the hBN(0002) planes decreases from the substrate to the surface of the film by 1.3% . We propose the following structural model, supported by density profiles extracted from reflectivity data: the samples consist of a layered structure of hBN-rich material near the substrate and a cBN-rich phase at the top of the film. The strain in the film increases from the substrate to the surface and is compressive in the film plane. The right figure shows some of the results of the annealing experiments carried out in situ in a high vacuum chamber. The cBN(111) lattice spacing of the as-grown film differs by 0.9% from the bulk value (dashed vertical line), corresponding to an in-plane stress of 4.2 GPa. Upon heating the cBN-lattice expands linearly until a temperature of about 65O Â°C, followed by a rapid and irreversible strain relaxation (full symbols). The cooling curve follows the bulk thermal expansion curve with a slope of 3.9~10.~ R' (straight line). The relaxed films has an in-plane lattice spacing of 2.081 A, i.e. a stress of 1.4 GPa. [l] W.
