<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering as a probe of the superconducting gap in the high-Tc superconductors Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+x we have investigated the modifications of the RIXS spectra at q // = (0.15, 0) r.l.u., a momentum transfer where the calculated charge susceptibility suggests the most salient modifications across T c (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The measurement was carried out with s-polarized incident light at the peak of the Cu L 3 absorption. A reduction of the RIXS spectral weight between the elastic line and the magnetic peak is clearly visible across the SC transition, whereas the paramagnon excitations remains substantially unchanged. This observation indicates that the changes are related to the opening of the SC gap. In this experiment HC3324 we performed further measurements in optimally-doped Bi2212 to pin down the origin of this modification. In particular, we investigated the q dependence of the modification, in order to judge whether the behaviour agrees with expectations from the q dependence of the particle-hole excitations across the d-wave SC gap. Furthermore, we also investigated an underdoped Bi2212 sample with T c = 60 K (UD60K), aiming at elucidating how the pseudogap opening in the antinodal region of the Fermi surface affects the low-energy RIXS response, and whether the modification is analogous to that primarily caused by the SC gap and shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows Cu L 3 RIXS spectra for Bi2212 OP90K above (150 K) and below T c (20 K), measured at small momenta q // = (0.1,0) and (0.071,0.071). The measurements were performed using the high-resolution setup (DE = 35 meV) with the s-polarized x-ray photons. We have chosen these specific q // values because the charge SC coherence factor becomes large at low momentum transfers, which may well cause a strong modification of the spectra upon entering the SC state. As expected from this theoretical consideration, we clearly observe a spectral weight depletion between the elastic line and the paramagnon peak, both at q // = (0.1,0) and (0.071,0.071) (as indicated by the black arrows in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). We can thus confirm the reproducibility of the spectral depletion in the SC state. Furthermore, toghether with the previous data at q // = (0.15,0) and (0.1,0.1), we can conclude that the rearrangement of the spectral weight is observed in |q // |&lt;0.15 r.l.u.. This is exactly what is expected from the q dependence of charge susceptibility due to the particle-hole excitations. On the other hand, the expected concomitant pileup of the spectral weight ("2D" coherence peak in the terminology of Raman scattering) is not clearly observed within the energy window investigated, consistently with previous data. The theoretical interpretation on this issue is detailed in Ref. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Finally, we show in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> the RIXS spectra for the UD60K. As in optimally-doped Bi2212 and Bi2223, we clearly observe a spectral weight depletion both at q // = (0.15,0) and (0.071,0.071) (black arrows). However, the spectra at 20 and 70 K almost overlap, showing little modification below T c =60K. This indicates that the spectral modification here is mainly attributed to the pseudogap opening. These measurements thus provide a way to quantify the unoccupied side of the pseudogap via charge response with arbitrary q. Data analysis is under way and possibly will lead to a new draft for a future publication.</p><p>[1] Long Term Project Report for Long Term Proposal HC886</p><p>[2] H. Suzuki et al., submitted.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>The goal of the proposal was to investigate the the modification of the Cu-L 3 Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) spectra across the superconducting (SC) transition temperature (T c ) in the Bi-based cuprates Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8+x (Bi2212) and Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10+x (Bi2223). In superconductors, the Cooper pair formation opens an energy gap in the the single-particle spectrum on the Fermi Surface (FS), which serves as the order parameter of the SC state. In the cuprate superconductors, it is established that the order parameter has a d x2-y2 -wave symmetry, where the sign changes along the x-and ydirections and the nodes are formed along the Brillouin zone diagonal. As a result, the charge and spin correlation functions are also renormalized upon entering the SC state, which we intended to observe in the present experiment.The measurement is made possible by the high resolving power of the ERIXS spectrometer at the beamline ID32 and the high T c 's of the optimallydoped Bi2212 and Bi2223 (90 and 110 K, respectively).
