<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Exp MA-1570 originally aimed at studying the local order in ferroelectrics under intense electrical fields, in particular in the case of BiFeO 3 . However, due to unexpected difficulties with sample preparation, Pb(Ti x Zr 1-x )O 3 (PZT) was studied at its place. The sample consisted in a DyScO 3 substrate (roughly 10*10mm 2 ) supporting a lower SrRuO 3 electrode (50 nm thick) and the PZT layer (100nm) topped by a 40nm Pt electrode (spatially patterned in patches of 300*800 m 2 ). The experiment presented several critical points like: realization of a suitable circuit for electrical excitation, preparation of a suitable metallic pattern on the sample in order to limit the sample capacitance to a few nF, use of the low intensity 4 bunch mode and use of a microbeam (200*200m 2 ) for the analysis of the single capacitor. In the two experimental sessions the overall feasibility of the experiment has been demonstrated. It has been possible to apply fields up to 200 MV/m on the sample synchronous with the X-ray flashes and with a time duration of 300ns. XANES spectra of good quality at the Zr-K edge with and without excitation were collected. Some differences have been evidenced, however, further glitches prevented us from safely drawing conclusions namely:</p><p> a deterioration of the sample was observed after one night of data collection under excitation. It was not possible to determine the exact moment as no continuous sample check protocol was adopted.</p><p> it was not possible to repeat the measurement in order to confirm the observations on a different capacitor, as the remainder of the capacitors delivered had their contact unwired, presumably during to the trip from Univ. Wisconsin to the ESRF. It was not possible, during the experiment, to find a micro-welding facility.</p><p>In conclusion it will be necessary to solve the welding problem and to investigate in more detail the deterioration process prior a new application for beamtime.
