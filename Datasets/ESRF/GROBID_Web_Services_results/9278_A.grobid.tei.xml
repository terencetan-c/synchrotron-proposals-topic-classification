<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The objective of this experiment was to investigate the spin moment in one of the ferromagnetic phases in the gadolinium yttrium alloy, G&amp;z.aY37.6, chosen instead of the original proposed sample, G&amp; . Y 89 31.1, for technical reasons: the same phenomena were studied. The magnetic Compton scattering technique used measures a projection of the spindependent electron momentum density, revealing the origin of contributing spin moments in a magnetic system, and providing a rigorous test of electronic structure calculations. The measured magnetic Compton profile (MCP) has an area proportional to the total spin of the measured sample. In the experiment, an induced spin moment of -0.4 I.&amp;j was observed for the first time on the Y conduction electrons in the alloy. Additionally, a pure Gd sample was measured to provide a comparison, revealing the effect of the Y on the momentum space spin density. A detailed comparison of the alloy results with LMTO calculations is in progress, and the pure Gd result is being prepared for publication in its own right, since previous measurements were limited to a much lower resolution, and were made in the phase where the moments are canted rather than collinear. Pure Gd is the only ferromagnetic 4f metal, whilst Y is non magnetic. Alloys form for all compositions, with a substitutionally disordered hcp structure. It is known that the alloy contains two ferromagnetic and one basal plane antiferromagnetic phase; Y does not simply ESRF Beamline: Date of Experiment:</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>behave as a diluent. The main objective in our study was to look for the presence of any induced moment on the Y electrons in the ferromagnetic phase. As well as measurements on ferromagnetic Gd and Gd-Y, the alloy was measured in its antiferromagnetic phase, both with and without afield present; the addition of the field forces the moments to align out of the basal plane, resulting in a non-zero induced moment.</p><p>In figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the MCP of pure Gd is presented, together with a band structure calculation performed using the FLAPW method <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. The sample temperature was maintained at 23X, at which temperature the sample is ferromagnetic, with a moment aligned along the c-axis. The MCP contains two main contributions, as indicated in the figure. The wide component is the 4f contribution to the magnetic moment, of value s = 7 pn. The narrower peak is a measure of the spin moment induced on the s,p,d conduction electrons, and its value was determined to be -0.6 vu by fitting the 4f part to the high momentum tails. This agrees well with theoretical predictions using the LMTO prescription, within both the local spin density and generalised gradient approximations. The LMTO results are now being used to predict the shape of the MCPs, in order to assess the quality of these approximations in the 4f magnetic system. Infigure2theMCPofG&amp; Y37.6 is presented. &amp;O ShOWn, on an enlarged scale, is the difference between the spin densities for the alloy and pure Gd, the curves being normalised to the 4f moment before subtraction. The MCP is very similar to that for pure Gd, showing the large contribution of the 4f electrons. The main differences occur at low momentum, as revealed by the difference plot. This shows changes in the spin-dependent electron momentum density attributed to the presence of an induced moment on those electrons originating from the Y sites. Analysis of the results for the antiferromagnetic phase indicate that the momentum distribution is not observably different from that in the ferromagnetic phase.</p><p>A paper on the pure Gd data is in preparation and will be submitted for publication as soon as our LMTO calculations are complete. The Gd-Y results, which unambiguously indicate the presence of an induced moment on the Y conduction electrons will be submitted as a Phys. Rev. Lett. In view of this result, we are extremely eager to study the distribution in the other ferromagnetic phase, in another composition of the alloy. The directional magnetic Compton profiles of Fe&amp; At high momenta the results approach free-atom Fe 3d electron behaviour (dashed line) whereas the KKR-CPA theory (solid line) is too low: this is a common fault of band theory when too few reciprocal lattice vectors have been included in the momentum expansion. There are other significant discrepancies at low momenta, which are still being analysed. Fe$i, which is better ordered, shows much closer agreement with theory.
