<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>a) Knowledge of porosity: SEM images give information about particles, not porosity. Standard techniques such as nitrogen adsorption tests are imprecise, defective, limited to pore sizes &lt;100 nm, and imply pore shapes to be cylindrical. Such 3D reconstruction would give insights into pore sizes &gt;100 nm. b) Knowledge of the structure and connectivity: Besides providing precious data for nanomechanical modelling (using the generated 3D structure data), it would be helpful towards tailoring the mechanical and thermal properties of aerogels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Targets achieved:</head><p>a) First, this attempt is conclusive that carbon and resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) aerogels can sustain radiation and can be tested at the ESRF beamline. b) Using 60 nm voxel sizes, sharp images from volume reconstructions were obtained. Noise was generated due to the presence of the glass tube around the specimen, but this was worked upon during post-processing of the data. c) The generated data gives insight to pores in the upper nano region (&gt;200 nm) and lower micro region (&lt;50 µm), which is very useful information. Pores at these scales cannot be obtained using nitrogen-adsorption tests (e.g., BJH calculations) or using mercury porosimetry. d) The 3D microstructure could be visualised with 60 nm voxel sizes, although the particle definitions could not be seen.</p><p>C. Targets not achieved: a) Images obtained at 10 nm voxel sizes were not very helpful. This was primarily because the specimen size was to too large for rendering nanotomographs at such low voxel sizes, and only a part of the specimen was captured. Although results were obtained, they do not help in understanding the underlying microstructure. b) There was sample movement in some specimen (see, for instance, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). c) Pore shapes below 200 nm could not be visualised, due to the limitation on the voxel size, which, in turn was based on the specimen size. d) The 3D nanostructure could not be visualised, due to the limitation on the voxel size based on the specimen size. Also -as mentioned above-, the microstructure is seen without particle definitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Detailed work report:</head><p>A. Sample preparation:</p><p>Four aerogels were synthesized for holotomography experiments: two resorcinol-formaldehyde and two carbon aerogels <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The monolithic carbon aerogels were dried and pulverized by means of a ball mill. Since they are softer, monolithic resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogels were ground with abrasive paper. No morphological changes in the network were observed in SEM after milling. After pulverisation, the powders were dried in an oven at 120°C over night to remove any water adsorbed from air.</p><p>Thin-walled quartz glass capillaries of 100 µm outer diameter and 10 µm wall thickness (Hilgenberg, Germany) were then densely filled with dried powder. The capillaries were then cut, sealed with paraffin wax, and fixed with Loctite Super Glue 3 onto sample holders for nanotomography.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Experimental setup:</head><p>The experiments were performed at beamline ID16A with X-ray energy of 17 keV at room temperature. During the tomographic scan the specimens were rotated around the vertical axis. The samples were imaged with 2000 projections at four different distances. Voxel sizes of 10 nm and 60 nm were used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Data rendering:</head><p>3D reconstructions of aerogels tested at voxel sizes of 60 nm:</p><p>All four samples (soft and hard carbon aerogels, and soft and hard RF aerogels) have been tested and resulted in good 3D visualisations above 200-300 nm scale range. Pore sizes above 150 nm can be characterised, i.e. sufficient data on micro-porosity was obtained. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, one can observe the 3D structures of all four specimens along with their sliced/zoomed versions generated using Visual Graphics Studio MAX 2.2.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>(b) shows the hard carbon aerogel sample, which is visibly moved during testing. Other three samples seem to be rather stable. The results show that the soft aerogels show larger pores and larger cavities, in comparison to their hard counterparts. This is only a first interpretation of the structure, while a more detailed analysis is ongoing.</p><p>3D reconstructions of aerogels tested at voxel sizes of 10 nm have not been shown, as no clear visualisations could be obtained.</p><p>(a) (b) (c) (d) </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: (a) Hard RF aerogel, (b) hard carbon aerogel, (c) soft RF aerogel, and (d) soft carbon aerogel. These images show the complete cylindrical specimen (100 µm) along with their zoomed version (600nm).</figDesc><graphic coords="4,337.20,225.36,222.24,189.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div><head>Outlook:</head><p>We have applied for more time at the <rs type="institution" subtype="infrastructure">ESRF</rs> for nanotomography experiments. With our first experience, and guidance from the on site team at ID16A (especially our local contact Julio Cesar Da Silva), we will be improving our sample preparation techniques in order to suit experiments on ID16A more effectively. Smaller specimen (approx. 10 µm) will enable us to attempt going to low voxel sizes. Accordingly, we intend to capture particle definitions, and obtain good visualisations at the nano-scale (also identify nano-porosity).</p></div>
