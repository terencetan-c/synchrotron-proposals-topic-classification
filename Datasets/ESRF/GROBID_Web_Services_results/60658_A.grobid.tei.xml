<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>From these spectra we can observe two things:</p><p> The pre edge region of the measured samples shows one pre edge which coincides with the pre edge peak of Cr2O3. In Cr2O3 the Cr ions are octahedrally coordinated. Suggesting a preferential octahedral coordination for the Cr ions.  The absorption step of the real samples is located between the absorption step of Cr2O3 and CrO2. This observation suggests the presence of the Cr ions as well in trivalent as tetravalent oxidations state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">EXAFS results</head><p>The EXAFS spectra were analysed using the Artemis software. The spectra of the samples were analysed together using MDS (multiple data set fitting). This approach is often used if parameters are expected to be the same in different data sets. As such the number of used parameters can be maintained low.</p><p>For all spectra a Hanning window was used [2.683 Å -1 , 10.84 Å -1 ] and [1 Å, 4.236 Å]. The structure of LGO was introduced to generate the scattering paths; both the Ga1 as the Ga2 site were used as possible sites for the Cr ion in the lattice. The scattering paths were calculated up to 4.5 Å in R space. Besides the possible substitution of two sites also the possible presence of two oxidation states has to be evaluated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>First all four virtual spectra were calculated to evaluate if one of the possibilities was preferential. The largest coincidence was found when the Cr ions occupy the octahedral Ga1 sites in the lattice. Subsequently the spectra were fitted using MDS with only this site and one oxidation state for the Cr ions. An R-factor of R=0.03 was found.</p><p>Subsequently the presence of another Cr absorber on the Ga1 site was introduced. The fit significantly improved and an energy shift of 0.82 eV was found. This energy shift indicates the different oxidation state for both Cr absorbers: Cr 3+ and Cr 4+ . Furthermore it was found that (69±1)% of the Cr ions is in the trivalent state and the other (31±1)% in the tetravalent state (the exact values of all fitting parameters are tabulated in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> with their respective errors). The R factor of the fit was in this case well below 0.020.</p><p>All the spectra are within the error margins similar, so no direct indication for the presence of Ge ions in the direct neighbourhood (within 4.5Å from the absorber) could be found. There are two possible reasons for this phenomenon: (1) no incorporation of Ge in the direct neighbourhood of the Cr ions, or (2) the similar atomic scattering factors of Ge and Ga make it difficult to differentiate between them.</p><p>Besides the preferential substitution of the Cr ions on the Ga1 sites, it is also observed that the Cr-O distance is smaller than the Ga1-O distance. This effect can be caused by the preferential shorter distance Cr-O (e.g. Cr2O3 and CrO2). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: XANES spectra of the LG(G,S)O samples measured at the Cr K edge together with the spectra of some reference compounds: Cr foil (metallic), Cr2O3 (trivalent chromium octahedral site) and CrO2 (tetravalent tetrahedral site).</figDesc><graphic coords="3,69.35,36.85,411.00,230.25" type="bitmap" /></figure>
