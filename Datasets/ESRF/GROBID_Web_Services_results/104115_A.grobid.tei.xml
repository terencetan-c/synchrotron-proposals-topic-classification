<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This work is the follow up of exepriments MA-5032 and MA-5456.</p><p>Innovative mixed oxide (MOx) (U,Pu)O2-x fuels for both thermal and fast neutron reactors are currently studiedto developp a more sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. In order to improve and ensure its safety, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the properties of the (U,Pu)O2-x fuel at every stage of its life even in accidental scenarios. In this project, we aimed at investigating the behaviour of spent MOx fuel under heavily oxidizing condition typical of accidents during interim storage. Due to fission, for each actinide cation (U, Pu, …) consumed, two lighter nuclei are formed, called Fission Products (FP). Most of these elements have largely different chemical behaviour with respect to U or Pu, thus they change significantly both the thermo-physical and microstructural properties of the pristine fuel during its lifetime <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In order to overcome the limitations associated with the irradiated fuel radiotoxicity, model materials called "SIMfuel" have been developed. SIMfuels are manufactured with the same process used for fresh fuel but the material is doped with stable isotopes of radioactive fission products. SIMfuels have therefore reduced radiotoxicity, and allow to study separately the effects of selected FPs. Traditionally SIMfuel is fabricated without Pu <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>, thus its applicability to real irradiated MOx fuel is therefore limited. Contrary to uranium, plutonium can be present in a reduced state (Pu 3+ ) which has a strong impact on both local oxygen stoichiometry and local redox equilibrium. The study of Pu-bearing SIMfuel (or SIMMOx) is thus critical for the understanding of the MOx fuel behaviour in accidental conditions</p><p>For this study, we employ SIMMOx doped with 11 non-radioactive isotopes of fission products. Those are divided into three categories based on their behaviour in irradiated fuel, namely: FPs soluble in the oxide matrix, FPs found in metallic precipitates, and Ba, which has been correlated to the formation of a wide range of oxide precipitates. To our knowledge, this is the first study on SIMMOx with this large variety of FPs. Samples from all compositions have been annealed at specific temperatures and atmospheres (oxygen potential) corresponding to nominal and accidental conditions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Kristina Kvashnina, Elena Bazarkina, Damien Prieur Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): R.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Three batches of SIMMOx samples have been fabricated at CEA Marcoule with the following compositions (called S, M, and B) given in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> below (g/g %). A fresh MOx with same (Pu+Am)/(U+Pu+Am) of the SIMMOx samples has been synthesized <ref type="bibr">(REF)</ref>, in order to have un undoped reference for our study. On each batch, an oxidizing treatement has been performed under flowing air, for a duration of 110 hours, and a temperature of 583 K. In this experiment we analized samples from each of the four composition (REF, S, M, and B) before, and after the oxidation treatment. The total number of samples is therefore 8. The samples naming scheme is straightforward, we wil use the name of the composition (REF, S, M, or B) and if the sample has been oxidized, "OX" is added ath the end. For example, sample "M" has a composition M and has not been oxidized, while sample "M-OX" has composition M and has been oxidized (-OX).</p><p>For each sample, the XANES has been collected in HERFD mode for the following edges: UMIV, PuMIV, BaLIII, CeLIII, LaLIII, and NdLIII edges. The analysis of AmMIV,V edge has not been possible due to its low concentration in the samples.</p><p>The data of the U MIV-edge XANES is presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. It is clear that the oxidation state of uranium changes drastically with the oxidizing treatment. The shape of the spectrum for sample S is consistent with a majority of U(IV) and a small fraction of U(V). On the other hand, after oxidizing treatment (sample S-OX), almost all uranium atoms seems to be U(V). No significant evolution is observed in plutonium spectra, which are consistent with 100% of Pu(IV).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1 HERFD-XANES collected at the U MIV-edge for samples S (blue) and SOX310 (red).</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents the HERFD-XANES spectra collected at Ba L3-edge and Ce L3-edge. For each edge, the signals before (blue) and after (red) oxidation are compared. Some experimentally acquired spectra of reference compounds are also plotted alongside the samples spectra. We can observe that Ba speciation remains unchanged after the oxidizing treatment, and can be consistent with a perovskite-type compound.  The analysis and interpretation of the data on the other FPs is still ongoing, and the results are being coupled with several laboratory and synchrotron techniques such as EPMA, Raman microscopy, and Synchrotron Powder XRD.</p><p>The complete set of the data will be published by the second quarter of 2024.</p></div>			</div>
