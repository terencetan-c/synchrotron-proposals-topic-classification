<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We used high spatial resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) to study device structure. An X-ray energy of 43.5 keV was selected and a vertical focussed X-ray beam of 0.8 m was used. The high X-ray energy and the small beam minimize absorption by the sample and hence degradation by X-rays. The X-ray beam goes through the sample which is mounted on a hot plate positionned on a goniometer. The X-ray diffraction pattern was recorded on a two-dimensional (2D) detector with a 0.63 m pixel size during the vertical scan of the sample (scan step = 0.5 m). In order to take advantage of the small beam size, the X-ray pathway inside the sample has to be kept as small as possible. The devices have an elongated shape and the X-ray path across the device is along the smaller sample size, approximately 2 mm. In order to precisely probe the polymer film, the X-ray beam direction was set parallel to the surface. A high-resolution X-ray camera was used for alignment purposes. After the alignment procedure, the polymer film can be considered extended parallel to the X-ray beam. The requirement of parallelism between the sample surface and the X-ray beam direction is essential to get the optimum spatial resolution.</p><p>We have studied thin films of polyvinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene P(VDF-TrFE) based polymers. A poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) film was deposited by screen printing on a polyimide (PI) substrate. An oven was used for ex situ sample annealing. The PVDF-based film is sandwiched between PEDOT:PSS electrodes. The active layer of the devices was either pure P(VDF-TrFE) or P(VDF-TrFE) with oxide particles. The devices were studied in situ during hot plate annealing as a function of temperature up to 120 °C and operando as a function of electrical polarization.</p><p>For each depth position, the HRXRD image is integrated azimuthally in order to get a 1D diffracted intensity as a function of q. As an example, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the XRD intensity I=f(q) for a 10 m thick P(VDF-TrFE) film during annealing on a hot plate at 80 °C. </p></div>			</div>
