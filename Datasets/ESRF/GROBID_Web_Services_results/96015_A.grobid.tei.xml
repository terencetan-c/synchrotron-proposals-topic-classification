<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This exeriment aimed to study the generation and fate of photogenerated halogen radicals in aqueous solution.</p><p>For this we investigated the subsequent kinetics following i) photodetachment from aqueous iodide generating nascent iodine atoms, and ii) after photoexcitation of aqueous tri-iodide. The tri-iodide experiment aimed to help assign the subsequent reaction products in the iodide detachment experiments.</p><p>In the iodide detachment experiment, after the sub-picosecond solvent reorganization, we monitored geminate recombination and secondary reaction product formation. Our measurements concentrated on 400 nm multiphoton driven electron ejection from aqueous halogen anion(s), mainly I -, and to a lesser extent Br -(aq). This approach allowed us to identify the structural signals around the nascent halogen atom(s) X 0 (X = I, Br), and to follow the formation of secondary species, I2 -, I3 -etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which we probed with ~ 100 ps time-resolved Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS). Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations hint towards different solvation shell structures around the nascent halogens I 0 (aq) and Br 0 (aq) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, exhibiting different mean X 0 -OH2 distances. One goal was to extract a detailed picture of the equilibrated water cage structure around the atomic halogen atoms.</p><p>Observing the formation kinetics of the secondary species is important as these species influence the geminate X 0 -e -recombination kinetics which have been interpreted in laser-oinly measurements as being due to the formation of an X 0 -e -(aq) contact pair <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</p><p>In the control experiment we investigated the quasi reverse process, 400 nm photodissociation of triiodide (I3 -), which initially yield (I2 -+ I 0 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The WAXS measurements can detect any intermediates or products of this dissociation reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</p><p>The samples were prepared by dissolving NaBr and NaI salts in concentrations of 10 mM -1 M in deionized water. Triiodide was generated by mixing iodine (I2) and iodide (I -) in water. Sample solutions were delivered into the interaction region via a closed loop liquid flat sheet jet of 300 µm thickness. 400 nm laser pulses (with ~ 1 ps FWHM, round spot of 300 µm, 1 kHz, with up to ~ 400 mJ/cm 2 ) was generated by second harmonic generation from the Ti:Sapphire amplifier and used for multi-photon ionization of the halides and for photodissociation of triiodide. The optical laser and x-ray beams overlapped spatially and temporally at the sample position with the X-ray beam (100 (H) x 60 (V) µm 2 ). The laser intensity was varied between 55 and ~ 550 µJ. Pink beam X-rays at ~ 18 keV were scattered from the samples over a helium purged chamber into the Rayonix MX170-HS CCD detector at varying time-delays from -3 ns to 1 µs and with a resolution of ~ 100 ps around time zero. The detector covered the q-space of up to ~ 8 Å -1 at 18 keV.</p><p>The transient WAXS at different time delays were produced from pairs of azimuthally integrated laser on and laser-off WAXS images (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Additionally, the solvent (water) scattering response to the laser heating was obtained in a separate measurement under the same conditions using a special dye (not shown). WAXS patterns were recorded for various time delays in the -3 ns to +1 µs region (~ 15 time points, each scan). Our time-resolved WAXS spectra after electron photo-detachment from aqueous iodide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) clearly show the pronounced transient laser-induced water heating signal (~ 1.5-3 Å -1 ), the change in the local water shell around the nascent iodine atom (q &lt; 1 Å -1 ) next to the generation of the reaction products I 0 , I2 -, (e.g., q &gt; 3 Å -1 ). Both the signal below 1 Å -1 and above ~ 3 Å -1 change on a 1 ns time scale, most likely due to the formation of I2 -, I3 - (analysis underway). The time-resolved WAXS spectra of triiodide also shows interesting changes especially in the q-ranges &lt; 1 Å -1 and &gt; 3 Å -1 , which has not bee reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The analysis of both groups of samples containing the same species in different charge states (I, I2 and I3) should allow us to unambiguously unravel the subnanosecond and submicrosecond reaction products. This will allow a more quantitative analysis of the iodine atom survival, which will allow us to confirm or falsify the existence od a long-lived aqueous contact pair (I-e). All WAXS measurements were recorded for different laser pulse energies (to match sample excitation conditions for different solute concentrations). Reaction product formation was also studied as a function of the initial solute concentration. Overall, this experiment was successful and we were able to complete the entire measurement program within the allocated beamtime. Beamline ID09-TR is extremely well suited for time-resolved measurements, we are most grateful to the tremendous support we received in both setup, experiment execution, and analysis from Matteo Levantino (beamline responsible), but also Michael Wulff next to the superb beam delivery by the ESRF machine group.  The different time delays are color coded, the xaxis displays the scattering vector q, while the y-axis displays the intensity of the signal.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1: Exemplary transient WAXS signal recorded after 400 nm photoexcitation of aqueous I -produced from pairs of azimuthally integrated laser on and laser-off images.
