<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have performed in-situ synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements in transmission on the ID15A beamline during the beamtime as indicated above. The diffraction measurements were synchronized with thermomechanical tests of nanocrystalline NiTi wires, with the aim to study the deformation mechanisms acting during such thermomechanical loading conditions. A custom made tensile tester MITTER was installed on the beamline and the beam (gauge volume) was placed at the center of the wire sample. The tester enables performing thermomechanical loading tests while controlling test temperatures at desired values within a range of -40 °C to 450 °C. Recording of the 2D diffraction images and stress-strain-temperature-electric resistance of the wire was synchronized via TTL signal throughout the testing.</p><p>The experimental parameterization is summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The acquired 2D diffraction images will be analyzed to extract lattice plane responses (i.e., integrated intensity, lattice strain, peak width) along sample direction(s) of interest and evolution of texture of involved phases during testing (Rietveld analysis).</p><p>Table 1. The synchrotron x-ray diffraction parameterization for our measurement. monochromatic x-rays energy: 85 keV (wavelength 0.14586 Å) beam size 150 × 150 μm 2 detector Pilatus3 X CdTe 2M detector (active area of 253.7 (W) × 288.8 (H) mm 2 and pixel size of 172 × 172 μm 2 ); sample-to-detector distance 935.075 mm exposure time for each measurement 0.01 s calibrant CeO 2 standard (NIST Standard Reference Material SRM-674a)</p><p>The NiTi wire under study is characterized by a reversible transformation between the parent cubic austenite (B2) and product monoclinic martensite (B19′) phases under temperature change (shape memory effect) and/or external stress (superelasticity). With further straining, the material accommodates plastic deformation mainly via deformation twinning, kinking and kwinking, assisted by dislocation slips. These deformation processes cause characteristic discontinuous lattice rotations in the material, which will be captured by the evolution of texture. The study thus attempts to analyze information on texture evolution (and also combining studys on texture modelling and TEM analysis of microstructures) in order to reveal deformation/transformation mechanisms activated during various thermomechanical loads frequently used in engineering applications of NiTi, as thermal actuator cycling, functional fatigue, low temperature shape setting and two way shape memory effect (TWSME).
