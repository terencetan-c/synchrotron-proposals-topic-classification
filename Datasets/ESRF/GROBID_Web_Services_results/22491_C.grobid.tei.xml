<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment number: CH 1213</head><p>Beamline: According to our preparation method and to IR measurements, the CoMoP/SiO2 sample might contain the cobalt diphosphopentamolybdate species (Co3P2Mo5O23). So we did a data-fit (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, not phase -corrected)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BM01B</head><p>based on the crystallographic data of Na5HP2Mo5O23. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> show the result of the fits. The region between 1 and 2 Å (not phase-corrected) in all the spectra, shows a typical distorted octahedral O shell. The results of the fit in the CoMoP/SiO2 sample in the region between 2 and 4 Å confirm that the cobalt and molybdenum precursors crystallize as Co3P2Mo5O23 on the SiO2 support.</p><p>The fit of CoMoP/g-Al2O3-TEG (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) shows that the structure of Co3P2Mo5O23 is retained although TEG causes an increase of the Debye-Waller factors of the Mo-P and Mo-Co shells. This can be explained by the fact that TEG suppressed C.U.S of alumina and prevented the decomposition of the phosphomolybdate species. We observed the same behaviour when bare SiO2 is used as support.</p><p>Thus, the results prove that the main role of glycol is to retain the structure of the phosphomolybdate structure over the g-Al2O3 support. Phosphomolybdate may be responsible for the increase of the catalytic activity in the CoMo hydrodesulfurization catalysts.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Daniele Nicosia*, Virginie Zuzaniuk*, Gerhard Pirngruber*, Prof. Roel PrinsReport:Cobalt-Molybdenum sulfides catalysts supported on g-Al2O3 are extensively used in the refinery industries to remove sulfur from oil feedstocks. Recently, improvements in the catalytic activity have been achieved using glycols and phosphate during the preparation of the catalysts. The catalyst is prepared by pore volume impregnation of a g-Al2O3 support with a solution containing phosphoric acid, cobalt carbonate, molybdenum trioxide, and a glycol like triethylene glycol (TEG). Phosphoric acid and the molybdenum precursor form a phosphomolybdates species in solution, whereas the structural role of the glycol is not known yet.Phosphomolybdates are unstable over the g-Al2O3 support. They may react with the coordinative unsaturated Al sites (C.U.S.) forming AlPO4 and heptamolybdate. Our previous Mo-K edge EXAFS experiments proved that triethylene glycol affects the structure of the molybdenum precursors over the g-Al2O3 support as shown in figure1 (not phase-corrected). Now wereport the proof that the effect of TEG is to suppress the g-Al2O3 C.U. sites preventing the decomposition of the phosphomolybdate. Figure2shows a comparison between the Mo-K edge EXAFS (not phase-corrected) of a silica-supported CoMoP catalyst and a CoMoP catalyst supported on_-Al2O3 impregnated with TEG. The silica support does not have C.U. sites thus the silicasupported CoMoP catalyst and the CoMoP supported on _-Al2O3 -TEG, show a similar EXAFS.</figDesc></figure>
