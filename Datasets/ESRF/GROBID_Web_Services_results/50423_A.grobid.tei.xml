<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Due to the technological progress of modern society in recent years there is increasing interest in new materials with advanced physical properties, which should lead to further evolution of nanoelectronics, spintronics, photonics, etc. Systems with self-organization and self-assembly are important part of this development. In this context, the monolayers of single-domain magnetic nanoparticles attracting considerable interest both from the point of view of possible applications, and for the fundamental theory of interaction and self-organization of nanoscale objects. In this research we investigated mono and bidisperse ensembles of magnetic nanoparticles on the surface of water in the self-organization process. We performed a unique combination of experimental methods: X-Ray reflectometry (XRR) and Grazing-Incident Small-Angle X-Ray Scattering (GISAXS), which allowed to study spacial distribution of electron density in the monolayer of nanoparticles both in depth and in the plane of the surface. A solution containing magnetic nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of the water in the Langmuir through, which were followed by isothermal compression, during which there was grow of homogeneous monolayer. The experiment was carried out on the ID10 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). GISAXS scattering pattern of the 10 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles ensemble were taken at an angle of incidence of synchrotron radiation αi = 0.2 o and pressure in the layer P = 5 mN / m and it shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref> shows the intensity profile along the dashed line. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref> shows the corresponding scattering pattern for the bidisperse ensemble of 10 nm and 20 nm nanoparticles in the proportion 3:1. The peaks at GISAXS scaterring patterns are corresponding to the the two-dimensional hexagonal lattice. The peaks (1 0) from the two-dimensional hexagonal lattices from of the monodisperse 10 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) and bidisperse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>) nanoparticles ensembles are most pronounced. At scattering map from monodisperse sample (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>) peaks <ref type="table">(1 1)</ref>, <ref type="table">(2 0)</ref> and <ref type="table">(2 1</ref>) is also visible. The main difference between the patterns from these systems is following: at the scattering from the bidisperse sample there are peaks (1 0), (1 1) and (2 0) from the 10 nm nanoparticles lattice and (1 0) from the 20 nm nanoparticles lattice, while in monodisperse sample there are peaks from only one subsystem.</p><p>The lattices constants of hexagonal lattice obtained from the GISAXS data is a1= 11.5 nm in case of monodisperse sample and a1= 13.2 nm and a2= 23.0nm, where a1 is the lattice constant of 10 nm nanoparticles subsystem and a2 is the lattice constant of 20 nm nanoparticles subsystem.</p><p>Results of the GISAXS and XRR confirm stable and reproducible formation of a monolayer of particles of hexagonal packing layer at a pressure of about 5-10 mN /m. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants(* indicates experimentalists): Dr. VOROBIEV* Alexei, Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute Dr. GRIGORIEV Sergey, Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute Dr. DYADKINA Ekaterina, Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute</figDesc></figure>
