Thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry or mass spectrometry measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance technique and high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction show that pristine spines and test plates are composed of Mg-rich calcite and comprise about 10 wt. % of anhydrous ACC, 1.2 to 1.6 wt. % of organics, and less than 0.2 wt. % of water. Anhydrous ACC originates from incomplete crystallization of a precursor ACC phase during biomineralization and is associated with intra-crystalline organics at the molecular level. Molecular interactions at organic/inorganic interfaces cause significant calcite lattice distortions of the tensile type. The latter are amplified during ACC crystallization and finally disappear after heat-assisted destruction of organic molecules. Converting the measured lattice distortions (strains) into internal stress components, we follow stress evolution upon annealing and find that complete crystallization of ACC leads to the isotropy of residual stresses in all investigated skeletal parts. These results allow us to speculate that organic macromolecules are preferentially attached to different crystallographic planes in the pristine test and spine samples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Biogenic calcites are produced by a variety of marine organisms (e.g. algae, echinoderms, mollusks, etc.) and exhibit diverse crystal morphologies, sizes, and crystallographic orientations.</p><p>They often have complex shapes and provide vital functions, such as mechanical reinforcement and optical filtering and focusing. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Sea urchins have different skeletal elements, among which, the coronal plates that form the test (body shell) and the spines that are projected from the test.</p><p>Although all these elements are calcium carbonate-based biominerals, their microstructures <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and magnesium contents are very different (2-12 mol% of Mg in spines <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and up to 11 mol% in the test plates <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> ). These variations are responsible for different mechanical properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> of the skeletal parts that hence are adapted to specific functions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> The test encases the internal organs of the sea urchins and protects them from the environment, whereas the spines are used for defense and locomotion. In order to further protect the test, the spines also function as sacrificial appendages that break easily and regenerate rapidly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Test plates and spines owe their lightweight material properties to a fenestrated porous meshwork, called the stereom differing in terms of geometry, regularity and density. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> The main difference in terms of micromorphology between the test plates and the spines is that the former are only composed of stereom and the later also reveal external dense wedges called the septa (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>During spine formation, the stereom is first deposited and its pores are subsequently filled to form the septa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> The fenestrated stereom is likely responsible for the relative strength of the echinoid spines, as it can prevent crack propagation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> while the compact septa was shown to improve the bending stress resistance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Sea urchin skeletal elements also contain small amounts of intra-crystalline organics, defined as all organic molecules that are inserted into the mineral, in contrast to inter-crystalline organics, which separate individual mineral elements. During biomineralization, intra-crystalline organic molecules become occluded by growing mineral. The intra-crystalline organics is therefore protected by the mineral against chemical or biochemical digestion and can only be degraded by heat treatment.</p><p>In earlier works, the soluble and insoluble fractions of the intra-crystalline organic matrix were extracted from sea urchin skeletal elements, using different solutions (EDTA, HCl, acetic acid). <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> The soluble protein fraction of P. lividus spines was determined to be 0.02 wt. %, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> while 0.1 wt.% of soluble and insoluble fractions were reported for Arbacia lixula. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Similarly, 0.2 wt. % of soluble and insoluble fractions were measured in the P. lividus test plates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Proteins in sea urchin skeletal elements have been extensively characterized. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Besides some glycoproteins and monosaccharides have been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and the presence of organic pigments was also reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Although sea urchin skeletal elements behave as single crystals in polarized light and X-ray diffraction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> they show conchoidal fracture-surfaces, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> which fundamentally differ from the atomically flat ones produced in geological calcite by cleavage. This behavior is attributed to impeded crack propagation by the occluded intra-crystalline organic molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Organic molecules are attached to specific crystallographic planes and, hence, facilitate the formation of single crystals of different shapes (see e.g. brief review <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> ). For example, it was shown that proteins in P. lividus sea urchin spines are preferentially adsorbed on calcite planes parallel to the c-axis (hk0-planes), <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> whereas proteins from sponge spicules and from calcitic prims of mollusk shells are mostly attached to the (001)-planes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> Note that in sea urchin spines, the c-axis is aligned with the long axis of the spines, whereas in the test plates (in P. lividus species), it is tangent to the test curvature in the apical direction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> To provide single-crystal-like diffraction spots, the organic/inorganic interfaces have to be coherent, i.e. "invisible" by the diffracted X-rays. This takes place, if the distances between crystal unit cells along complex topologies, determined by organic macromolecules, can be expressed by an integer number of translation vectors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> However, atomic interactions at the interfaces may cause lattice distortions, as first detected in biogenic aragonite from Acanthocardia tuberculata bivalve shell <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> and thereafter in many other biogenic calcium carbonate crystals (see, e.g. review <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> ). Under mild annealing, the organic macromolecules are defragmented and removed from the bio-composite leading to the breaking of the interfacial coherence. This process is accompanied by the relaxation of lattice distortions and a substantial broadening of diffraction lines, indicating in turn a reduction in the size of crystalline blocks, which coherently scatter X-rays. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> Organic molecules are also known to stabilize amorphous precursor mineral phases and longliving amorphous phases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> The long-living amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) phase present e.g. in calcareous sponges (ca. 15-20 wt.%) and in ascidians (ca. 80 wt.%) is hydrated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> In contrast, during the formation of sea urchin larval spicules, hydrated ACC is short-lived and transforms rapidly into a second disordered phase, most likely anhydrous transient ACC <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> that slowly crystalizes into calcite. In adult sea urchin (Anthocidaris crassispina) spines, stable ACC (up to 8 at. %) was identified by nuclear resonance technique and suggested to be hydrated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> It was also evidenced that the inner stereom of sea urchin (P. lividus) spines is formed via an ACC phase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> whereas the crystallization of the septa was suggested to occur via direct crystallization without an ACC precursor phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Sea urchin skeletal elements have been extensively studied, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> but many questions still remain open, e.g. those regarding their composition and the interplay between components, namely calcite, ACC, and organic macromolecules. Here we address this issue by studying the spines and test plate samples annealed at different temperatures. The function of annealing is three-fold: water evaporation, crystallization of ACC and destruction of organic molecules. These transformations are monitored by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or mass spectroscopy (MS) measurements. Highly accurate values of calcite lattice parameters, as well as total amount of non-crystalline components at each temperature are extracted by applying Rietveld refinement to high resolution X-ray powder diffraction (HRXRD) data, collected at a dedicated synchrotron beam-line. In order to quantify the lattice distortions produced by intra-crystalline organics, one has to subtract the Mg-effect on lattice parameters, i.e. their decreasing with Mg concentration. For this purpose, Mg-content in different skeletal parts was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Such comprehensive characterization of chemical composition, phase content and differences in the atomic structure in different skeletal elements of a particular organism, P. lividus, contributes to our understanding of biomineralization pathways.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Biogenic calcite samples</head><p>Sea urchins specimen of P. lividus, collected in the Atlantic Ocean, were received from the Roscoff marine station of Sorbonne University, University Pierre et Marie Curie (France) in June 2015. Large and small spines, as well as dissociated coronal plates of the test, were cut off three different sea urchins collected in the same place during the same period of the year. Small and large spines, being on average, respectively, 0.29±0.09 cm and 1.17±0.12 cm long, were taken from the same sea urchin specimens.</p><p>The samples were suspended in a 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution for 5 h under agitation on a rocking table in order to remove the external organic material. After rinsing with distilled water and air-drying, the different skeletal elements were ground to produce fine powders. The powders were further washed with NaClO for one day and then rinsed several times with distilled water and again washed with fresh NaClO for 12 h and rinsed.</p><p>The prismatic layers of the mollusk shells, Pinna nobilis (P. nobilis), collected in the Mediterranean Sea (Port-Cros Island, France) were used to produce fine powders studied for comparison. The powders were washed with NaClO for one day and then rinsed several times with distilled water.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Inductively coupled plasma -optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)</head><p>The total Mg-content in the spines and test plates was determined by ICP-OES (Optima 8000, Perkin Elmer Inc., USA) after dissolution of powdered samples in an acidic solution (167 µl HNO 3 and 333 µl HCl). The software WinLab 5.2 was used to extract and analyze the data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)</head><p>Mg-concentration in large spines annealed at different temperatures was also measured by WDS in SEM. Measurements were carried out by using microscope FEI E-SEM Quanta 200 at the following experimental conditions: accelerating voltage -30 kV, filament current -55 nA, 30º take-off angle for collecting the fluorescent X-rays. For quantitative analysis with Ca Kα and Mg Kα X-ray lines, the diopside mineral (MgCaSi 2 O 6 ) served as a lone standard. The coefficients of matrix correction were calculated for stoichiometric compositions of Mg x Ca 1- x CO 3 . Using WDS, eleven samples were measured, in twenty sampling points each, the X-ray fluorescence signals being taken from central parts of visible mineral crystallites.</p><p>2.4. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) -differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and TGAmass spectrometry (MS) TGA coupled with DSC measurements (SENSYS evo TGA-DSC, SETARAM Instrumentation, Caluire, France) were performed with approximately 30 mg of powdered samples placed in an aluminum or alumina crucible, depending on the maximum temperature to be reached in the experiment (500 or 820 °C, respectively). As we observed "jumping" of some powdered particles (mostly for large spines, Video SI) out of the crucible at about 450 °C, alumina caps were designed to cover the alumina crucibles in order to avoid any elusive weight loss due to this effect. Weight loss and heat flow were measured during programmed heating (25-820 °C at 2 °C/min, followed by holding at 820 °C for 30 min to 2 h), by using a nitrogen (20 mL/min) and oxygen (10 mL/min) purge gas mixture. Weight corrections for flow unbalances were made in order to accurately subtract the background and obtain reliable quantitative data for weight loss and heat flow.</p><p>For TGA coupled with MS measurements, we used LABSYS evo TGA-DSC, SETARAM system (France), combined with mass-spectra analyzer of gas discharge (QGA Hiden (UK)).</p><p>These measurements were performed in the temperature range 25-600 °C at heating rate of 2 °C/min, using 20% O 2 in Ar, as purge gas mixture (30 ml/min).</p></div>

Zirconia rotors of 7 mm diameters were spun at a MAS frequency (ν MAS ) of 5 kHz. π/2 pulses were 4.7 and 3.5 µs for 1 H and 13 C, respectively. Recycle delays (RD) were set to 5 s for 1 H and 1 H→ <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> C cross polarization (CP) MAS experiments and 2000 s for <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> C single pulse experiments. For 1D 1 H→ 13 C CP MAS experiments, contact times of 250 µs, 500 µs, 1 ms and 10 ms were used. For 2D { 1 H} <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> C HetCor experiments, the contact time was 1 ms and 48 t 1 increments of 400 scans were used. All 13 C spectra were proton decoupled at the acquisition (SPINAL 64). All spectra were referenced (δ = 0 ppm) to TMS for 1 H and 13 C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6.">X-ray diffraction</head><p>For high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) measurements, fine powders of spines and test were prepared by grinding with mortar and pestle. The powders were then annealed for 1 h at selected temperatures: 50, 80, 100, 140, 170, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400°C, in a Nabertherm 30-3000 °C oven equipped with a controller P320. About 20 wt.% of synthetic diamond powder (size ≤ 1µm, 99.9% metals basis, Alfa Aesar 13401 LOT K222058), used as internal standard for X-ray diffraction measurements, was added to each one of the annealed sea urchin powders.</p><p>Thus prepared samples were put in glass capillaries, 1 mm in diameter, and then measured at room temperature using high-resolution powder diffraction instrument at dedicated beam-line ID22 of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The X-ray wavelength of 0.399952(2) Å was calibrated with Si standard sample (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The use of the advanced analyzing optics resulted in diffraction patterns of superior quality and above all in intense and narrow diffraction peaks with an instrumental contribution to the peak widths not exceeding 0.004 º50 . Rietveld refinement of the obtained HRXRD profiles was performed with the FULLPROF package. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> Conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to check whether the decomposition of the initial Mg x Ca 1-x CO 3 into CaO and MgO is complete at high temperatures (about 820 o C). As described below, this issue is important for estimating total amount of intra-crystalline organics and water in pristine samples. XRD measurements were performed using a laboratory X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8, Germany), equipped with a standard sealed tube (Cu-anode, wavelength 1.5406 Å).</p></div>

The coronal plates of the test (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) are bearing large and small tubercles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), to which large and small spines are respectively anchored. The plates and tubercles are made of different types of stereom. The top of the tubercle is covered by a dense mineralized layer perforated with small pores (5 µm in diameter) irregularly arranged and the base is composed of a regular stereom with pores of about 10-15 µm in diameter connected by 5 µm-wide struts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Fracture fragments reveal the stereom of the plate beneath (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), which is more compact with smaller pores than the base of the tubercle.</p><p>Large and small spines consist of a base composed of stereom and a shaft (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</p><p>Fractured cross-sections of the middle part of the shaft reveal dissimilar inner morphologies of large and small spines.

The water content determined by the TGA measurements up to 200 °C is very small (&lt; 0.2 wt.%) in all samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>), as confirmed by MS measurements that did not record significant H 2 O discharge up to 300 °C (SI Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Thus, considering a maximum water content of 0.2 wt.% for all samples, the amounts of intra-crystalline organics in large spines, small spines and test plates are, respectively, 1.3 ± 0.2 wt.%, 1.2 ± 0.3 wt.% and 1.6 ± 0.4 wt.%. Therefore, these amounts are not significantly different in large and small spines, while slightly higher in test plates.</p><p>The derivatives of the TG-curves (dTG, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>) magnify the peculiarities of the weight loss, as a function of annealing temperature. The dTG of the large spines reveals the first weight loss region, with maximal loss rate at about 280 °C, corresponding to a weight loss of 0.9 ± 0.2 wt.% due to the destruction of organic macromolecules in agreement with CO 2 emissions at this temperature (SI Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). The second weight loss region, with maximal loss rate at about 450 °C, is due to further organics combustion accompanied by significant water and CO 2 emissions (SI Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). At this temperature, the powder particles were observed to jump (jet effect) (see SI video), probably due to the explosion of gas-filled and water-filled inclusions as evidenced by the extensive gas discharge (SI Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This phenomenon resembles the process of rock decrepitation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> The increase of the internal pressure in biogenic minerals was already estimated to be 200-350 MPa between 300 and 500 °C and suggested to be due to the destruction of organic macromolecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> Small spines show a dTG curve very similar to large spines, with first weight loss at about 280 °C (0.54 ± 0.1 wt.%) and the second one at 475°C (2.7 ± 0.2 wt.%). At the same time, the test plates reveal different dTG curve than those for large and small spines (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). The first weight loss is smaller for the test plates than for the large spines (0.4 ± 0.1 wt.% versus 0.9 ± 0.2 wt.%, respectively) but it also correlates with CO 2 emissions and possibly with H 2 O emissions.</p><p>The second weight loss region (350-600 °C) is composed of two distinct weight losses: one between 300 °C and 475 °C (1.5 ± 0.1 wt.%) and a second one between 475 °C and 600 °C (2.1 ± 0.3 wt.%) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Interestingly, the decrepitation phenomenon was far less pronounced in the test plates than in the large spines (see SI video), suggesting that the internal pressure effect is less important for the former than for the latter. This is most likely due to the differences in microstructure. Specifically the presence of compact wedges in large sea urchin spines might prevent vapor and gas discharge whereas the presence of multiple micro-pore networks in test plates allows direct release of forming gas upon annealing.</p><p>For all samples, the second weight loss is higher than the total calculated organics content, based on measurements at 820 o C. We attribute this difference to the partial overlap on the temperature scale between the combustion of intra-crystalline organics and early decomposition of the Mg-rich biogenic calcite (into CaO and MgO). Indeed, geological calcite begins to decompose at about 600 °C, whereas decomposition of the Mg-enriched calcite can start at about 400 °C55, 56 ; in addition, highly porous structures of sea urchins may facilitate the decomposition of biominerals at lower temperatures. Upon heating at 600 °C and above, all our samples show substantial mineral phase decomposition with a third massive weight loss and a significant CO 2 discharge (SI Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). followed by holding samples at the latter for 0.5 h; B) the corresponding derivatives of the TGcurves (dTG).

The first peak is observed in all samples around 200 °C and is not accompanied by any significant weight loss.

The second exothermic peak, at about 290 °C for large spines and at about 260 °C for small spines and test plates (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), is due to partial destruction of intra-crystalline organic molecules, which corresponds to the first weight loss region described above.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p>Biogenic composites, based on calcium carbonate, are complex structures comprising a crystalline part, an amorphous phase, organic macromolecules and some amount of water. The interconnection of these constituents often results in superior properties of the bio-composites. In this paper, we shed additional light on this interconnection in sea urchin skeletal elements by first characterizing the different components and second measuring lattice distortions in the biogenic calcites and their changes induced by heating. The latter approach has been proven to be very effective in the studies of biogenic calcite and aragonite in mollusk shells, as well as in other marine organisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> It is often assumed that lattice distortions arise at an early stage of biomineralization due to the initial deposition of an amorphous precursor and the subsequent amorphous/crystalline phase transformation within confined compartments, outlined by intracrystalline organics. Crystallization of calcium carbonate is accompanied by the reduction of specific volume per molecule. Therefore, it was suggested that in confined compartments the forces acting at organic/inorganic interfaces will work against this shrinkage, producing relative lattice distortions (strains) primarily of a tensile character. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> In calcite, the elastic modulus along the a-axis, C 11 = 149.4 GPa, is much higher than that along the c-axis, C 33 = 85.2 GPa 66 , which implies much smaller effect of equal uniaxial stresses on the a-lattice parameter than on the clattice parameter.</p><p>In principle, the stress state of a material can also be influenced by pore formation.</p><p>Additionally to the micron-size pores in sea urchin skeletal parts that are related to the stereom structure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), we have experimental results, obtained by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which point out the presence of nano-porosity in our samples. However, temperaturedependent integrated SAXS intensity (see SI Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>) is practically constant in the temperature range of ACC crystallization, indicating that the pore volume fraction remains unchanged. In addition, we note that the pore formation in the tensely-stressed material is expected to lead to strain/stress relaxation rather than to strain increase, as we observed during ACC crystallization.</p><p>Therefore, the observed strain/stress evolution during crystallization is most likely due to atomic interactions at organic/inorganic interfaces rather than pore-assisted mechanism.</p><p>In general, we expect that intra-crystalline organic macromolecules influence the amount and type of lattice distortions of the biogenic composites. Furthermore, the magnitude of lattice distortions is affected by the completion of the ACC/calcite phase transformation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> In other words, we expect inverse relationship between lattice distortions and the amount of the remnant amorphous phase within the biogenic calcium carbonate. In the following, we discuss the observed lattice distortions behavior upon annealing bearing in mind changes in the content of water, ACC and organics within large and small spines and within the test plates of the sea urchin P. lividus. We also further compare these results to those reported for the calcitic prisms of the mollusk shell P. nobilis. Using this approach, we expect to better understand the role of organics and ACC in biomineralization processes, in general, and in the origin of lattice distortions in biominerals, in particular.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Lattice distortions and intra-crystalline organics</head><p>Using TGA/DSC measurements, we found nearly the same amounts of intra-crystalline organics in the three different sea urchin skeletal elements. However, the dTG profiles and DSC/MS measurements suggest that these organic molecules may be of different nature.</p><p>Although amino acid composition of the protein fraction in sea urchin spines and test plates is very similar, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> certain dissimilarities have been detected in the spatial distribution of glycoproteins and sialic acid in the dense septa and in the porous stereom of the spines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Various organic macromolecules, present in the spines and in the test plates, being attached to particular crystallographic planes, will result in different lattice distortions. Furthermore, differences in the initial lattice distortions between sea urchins and mollusk shells could also be due to the presence of dissimilar organic molecules. Indeed, pristine mollusk shells of Atrina rigida and P. nobilis shells that show higher Δc/c than sea urchin skeletal elements (Δc/c (Atrina rigida) ≈ 0.19 % and Δc/c (P. nobilis) ≈ 0.24 %) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , contain proteins that are more acidic <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> than the ones in spines and test plates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> It was shown that these acidic proteins strongly interact with the charged calcite planes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> We found that the destruction of organic macromolecules (above 250 °C) in sea urchins skeleton leads to a subsequent reduction of lattice distortions accompanied by the loss of interface coherence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> as evidenced by the broadening of X-ray diffraction lines (see SI Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>).</p><p>Note that this broadening effect was observed in other biominerals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> Substantial relaxation of lattice distortions upon mild annealing above 250 o C, when intra-crystalline organics are destroyed, provides strong evidence that lattice distortions are caused by atomic-level interactions at organic/inorganic interfaces. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> Additional support comes from the fact that comparable lattice distortions also appear in synthetic calcite grown from solution containing organic macromolecules (see review <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> ).</p><p>We stress that in spines the magnitude of Δc/c decreases almost to zero at 400 °C, while in test plates samples it plateaus at Δc/c ≈ 0.11 %. As evidenced by dTG profile and CO 2 discharge, test plates, as opposed to spines, reveal significant organics destruction at temperatures higher than 400 °C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). This means that massive destruction of organic component and corresponding complete relaxation of the lattice distortions is expected at higher temperatures in test plates than in spines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Forces acting at the organic/inorganic interfaces</head><p>The intra-crystalline organics, together with ACC, are important "ingredients" for producing the lattice distortions measured by HRXRD. Since the amounts of ACC and intra-crystalline organics in the three investigated sea urchin skeletal parts are nearly the same, the differences in the initial values of lattice distortions and their changes upon annealing should be due to distinct interactions between dissimilar intra-crystalline organics and crystallites formed. In order to shed additional light on these distinctions, we converted the measured lattice distortions into the stress tensor components, σ 11 (in basal plane) and σ 33 (along the c-axis), which arise from the forces acting at the organic/inorganic interfaces. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> Using known shapes of the strain and stress tensors for hexagonal crystal symmetry, we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">𝜎 !! = 𝐶 !! + 𝐶 !" ! ! + 𝐶 !" ! !<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">𝜎 !! = 2𝐶 !" ! ! + 𝐶 !! ! !<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where 𝐶 !" are the components of the calcite stiffness tensor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> The calculated stress components, σ 11 and σ 33 , are plotted in Figures 7, as functions of annealing temperature. In general, the temperature dependences of stress components resemble that of lattice distortions (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). However, a quantitative analysis of these stress functions leads to interesting results. The stress component σ 33 originates mainly from the action of organic macromolecules attached to the (001) calcite planes, whereas σ 11 originates from organics attached to the calcite planes parallel to the c-axis. For the spines, σ 33 &lt; σ 11 whereas for the test plates, σ 33 ≈ σ 11 . Therefore, we expect organic molecules to be preferentially attached to the planes parallel to the c-axis in the spines and equally attached to planes parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis in the test plates. For the sea urchin spines, the stress distribution fits well with earlier observations based on the measurements of the X-ray coherence lengths in sea urchin spines along different crystallographic directions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Furthermore, we compare the ratio, φ = σ 33 /σ 11 , for sea urchin elements and for P. nobilis prisms (taking the values of lattice distortions from ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> ) in the temperature range 25-250 o C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7C</ref>), i.e. when crystallization of ACC is practically completed. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7C</ref>, the behavior of the stress ratio upon annealing in spines differs from that in test plates and P.</p><p>nobilis. In spines, φ increases up to 1 at 250 o C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7C</ref>). This suggests that in the remnant ACC regions adjacent to organic macromolecules, the crystallization front proceeds along the caxis. As a result, a part of organic macromolecules become occluded at the (001) atomic planes, subsequently increasing the σ 33 stress component. This trend, although to a lesser degree, is observed for test plates, evidencing that organics attached to the newly formed (001)-planes is a rather small fraction of those already present at the (001) planes in pristine test samples.</p><p>We emphasize that all temperature curves of the ratio, φ = σ 33 /σ 11 , measured in spines, test plates, and P. nobilis shell, converge to φ ≈ 1, when crystallization is completed. In other words, complete crystallization of ACC within confined space, outlined by organic macromolecules, leads, in these cases, to isotropic distribution of residual stresses, the latter being nearly equal in basal plane of the formed calcite and along the c-axis. Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms that stand behind this result. σ 33 ; C) the ratio, σ 33 /σ 11, converging in all investigated species to σ 33 /σ 11 ≈ 1 at 250 o C. Data obtained for large spines, small spines, test plates and P. nobilis prisms are represented, respectively, by red squares, blue dots, black triangles and green diamonds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Using heat treatment and advanced characterization methods, we investigated the interrelationship between calcite, ACC, water, and intra-crystalline organics in skeletal elements of P. lividus sea urchins. A significant amount of intra-crystalline organics was found in all pristine samples (average 1.4 wt. %), but different organic molecules are likely present in the spines and test plates. Small amount of water (&lt; 0.2 wt. %) and about 10 wt. % of anhydrous ACC (Ca:H 2 O ratio 1:0.1) were detected in all pristine samples. We suggest that this anhydrous ACC is the result of incomplete crystallization during the biomineralization process in adult sea urchins.</p><p>As in others biogenic calcites <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , lattice distortions in sea urchin skeletal elements originate from the atomic interactions at organic/inorganic interfaces and are amplified during the crystallization of ACC phase. The latter idea has previously been discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , but never proved experimentally. Here, we provide direct evidence of the amplification mechanism by detecting an increase of lattice distortions (strains) during heat-assisted crystallization of remnant ACC.</p><p>The strongest effect is on the magnitudes of lattice distortions along the c-axis, mostly because the stiffness constant C 33 in calcite is almost two times smaller than C 11 .</p><p>Using the linear elasticity theory, we convert the measured strains to stress components, acting in the basal plane of calcite (σ 11 ) and along its c-axis (σ 33 ). This analysis shows that in pristine test plates, σ 33 ≈ σ 11 , while in pristine spines the magnitude of σ 33 is considerably smaller than that of σ 11 (σ 33 /σ 11 ≈ 0.7). Based on these results, we can conclude that in pristine spines and test plates organic macromolecules are preferentially attached to different crystallographic planes of calcite. Crystallization of ACC at about 200-250 o C leads to the isotropy of residual stresses (σ 33 /σ 11 ≈ 1) in all types of sea urchin skeletal elements.</p><p>Annealing at temperatures above 250 o C facilitates destruction of intra-crystalline organics and subsequent reduction of lattice distortions. This process is accompanied by considerable broadening of X-ray diffraction lines due to deterioration of the interface quality.</p><p>We stress that a rather small amount of ACC (about 10 wt. %) leads to relatively low lattice distortions in pristine sea urchin skeletal parts. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that relatively thin ACC regions are adjacent to organic/inorganic interfaces, serving as buffer layers between intra-crystalline organics and crystalline calcite. This phenomenon seems to be common in biominerals, which are formed via an amorphous precursor and might have functional advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> . This principle resembles the use of amorphous buffer layers in semiconductor heterostructures, grown to prevent large lattice mismatch between components and non-desired dislocation formation. One could further speculate that the degree of crystallization depends on an energy balance between stabilizing an otherwise unstable amorphous phase and forming a crystal with elastic energy stored in the form of lattice strains.</p><p>We believe that the results presented here provide strong evidence that the three main components in sea urchin skeletal elements, i.e., ACC, intra-crystalline organics and calcite act in synergy to build bio-composites adapted to appropriate function. This is another astonishing</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Scanning electron micrographs of the microstructure of sea urchin skeletal elements:</figDesc><graphic coords="13,82.10,72.00,468.00,339.55" type="bitmap" /></figure>
