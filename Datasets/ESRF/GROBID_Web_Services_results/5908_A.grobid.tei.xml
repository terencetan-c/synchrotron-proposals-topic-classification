<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">-Influenza virus hemagglutinin / HC19 antibody Fab fragment complex</head><p>We attempted to collect a complete dataset at cryogenic temperatures (100 K). Previous experiments, at the resolution attainable at the L. U.R.E. (4 Å), had indicated this might be possible; but at 3Å, which is the resolution we were aiming for, the mosaicity of cryo-cooled crystals (which was in every case higher than 0.3°) proved incompatible with sufficient spot separation -a very drastic requirement in that particular case, as the crystal form has one very long unit cell axis (515 A).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">-Influenza virus hemagglutinin / BH151 antibody Fab fragment complex</head><p>In preliminary attempts of data collection at room temperature, we found that crystals of this complex were very sensitive to radiation damage. We have therefore collected data at 100K on a single crystal using the cryosystem implemented at the ID2 station.</p><p>To optimize data collection, we built "perpendicular loops", where the plane of the loop was approximatively set perpendicular to the spindle axis; we chose that strategy because of the special morphology of the crystals -i.e. thin plates with the highest symmetry axis perpendicular to the plate. In this way, we were able to collect a complete dataset with sufficient redundancy, using a 50° rotation about the spindle axis.</p><p>The diffraction pattern is strongly anisotropic: the observed resolution limit is 2.5 Å along the C* axis but only 3.0 Å in the (a*,b*) plane. The mosaicity is relatively high ( 0.6°) -which is often observed with cryo-cooled crystals. On the other hand, decay of crystal diffraction is negligible and this has allowed us to collect a data set of good quality (see statistics below).</p><p>The data characteristics after processing with software MOSFLM (version 5.2-A. G. W. <ref type="bibr">Leslie (1990)</ref> in 'Crystallographic computing', Oxford University Press) and programs of the CCP4 suite (Rotavata-Agrovata) areas follows:</p><p>-maximum resolution: 2.7Å -completeness: 98% -Rsym on intensities: 6.4% -average redundancy: 2.5</p><p>The structure of this complex has been solved by molecular replacement and refinement is now in progress.</p></div>			</div>
