<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The goal of the experiment was to use the fast imaging capabilities of the ID19 beamline to visualize the microstructural changes and fluid flows that take place during and after frying. The experiments were performed at 2.2 µm and 5.5-µm at 1 tomograph/second (1000 images) at 6 time points with 10 s and 3 s intervals. During the beamtime, we scanned a total of about 150 samples using different configurations.</p><p>A custom experimental setup (Error! Reference source not found.) was used to perform the in-situ tomography, the samples were lowered into heated oil(180 °C) remotely to image the first few seconds of frying. Additionally, to observe the oil uptake during cooling the sample was imaged after remotely retracting the sample from the hot oil post-frying. The beam had to pass through about 8 mm of borosilicate glass, 50 mm oil, 2.5 mm teflon and 14 mm aluminium rod during rotation, which resulted in some unavoidable artefacts such as streaking and poor contrast in certain cases. Although we faced several minor issues related sample movements and unexpected beam loss during scanning, we successfully completed all planned samples.</p><p>The imaging at 2.2 µm provided an important insight into the pore formation and structure deformation influenced by different sample compositions, the shorter 3 s interval between scanned time points added context to the large deformations previously missed in 10 s intervals (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>This allowed us to make some new observations on structure deformation, where pores formed during sample formulation expand first in the outer regions as the starch gelatanizes, these pores are subsequently compressed and collapsed by the expansion of pores in the core regions, thus deforming the structure as a whole and creating site for future oil uptake. It was also confirmed that, with the exception of low moisture samples, the oil uptake in the porespace was limited by a combination of initial structure expansion and gases escaping from the surface.</p><p>In addition, a smaller subset of samples was tested at two different oil temperatures to study the effect of frying temperature on structure deformation and subsequent oil uptake.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Experimental setup (inset:sample holder)</figDesc><graphic coords="2,356.40,603.93,204.35,153.05" type="bitmap" /></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Table 1: Reconstructed images of fried samples at different time intervals</head><p>The second set of scans at 5.5µm were primarily performed to observe the oil invasion into the pores during the cooling phase. These scans provided valuable information of 3D distribution oil uptake in the first few seconds after frying. It was observed that most of the oil uptake is during this period and greatly influenced by the structure deformations during frying. Oil invasion could primarily be driven due to a combined capillary action and reduction of vapour pressure during cooling. </p></div>			</div>
