<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The purpose of this experiment was the in-situ investigation of the evolution and the anisotropic dynamic scaling behavior of ion-induced ripple morphologies during oblique high-fluence ion sputtering of silicon surfaces. For this, a high-flux Kaufman type ion source has been mounted onto the vacuum chamber of the beam line. After some initial experiments, e.g. to determine the erosion rate of the silicon surface under the present experimental conditions, Si(100) samples have been bombarded with 500 eV Ar ions at different angles of incidence θ ion = 65°, 67°, and 69° with respect to the surface normal. The highest fluence applied was Φ = 1.6 x 10 19 cm -2 . The setup of the vacuum chamber and the high heat load introduced to the sample by the ion flux made it necessary to stop the sputtering and realign the sample prior to each measurement. The surface morphology has been characterized by grazing incidence small angel X-ray scattering at fixed incident angle (θ = 0.3° with respect to the surface) and energy (E = 17.5 keV). The diffuse scattering has been monitored using a cryogenically cooled charge coupled device camera with 1024 x 256 pixels and a pixel size of 19 µm. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a scattering diagram recorded after 240 s of sputtering at θ ion = 67°. The onedimensional power spectral density (PSD) functions S n,p (k n,p ) in the direction normal and parallel to the ion beam have been determined from cuts of the scattering diagrams along the dashed and the solid white lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, respectively. The S n,p (k n,p ) functions at different fluences for 67° incidence are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2(a</ref>,<ref type="figure">b</ref>). In both directions, a power law scaling regime develops with increasing fluence. Power law fits to the S n,p curves yield roughness exponents α n = 0.72 and α p = 0.42 in the direction normal and parallel to the ion beam. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>(a), the roughness exponents for the three incident angles under investigation are depicted. At θ ion = 65°, a strong scaling anisotropy is observed with α n = 0.81 ± 0.05 and α p = 0.04 ± 0.02. At θ ion = 67°, however, this anisotropy is substantially reduced, and at θ ion = 69°, the scaling of the surface becomes isotropic with α p ≈ α n = 0.46 ± 0.07. This observed transition from strong anisotropic to isotropic scaling can be interpreted in terms of a phase transition with a critical point at θ ion = 69°. This critical point then can be considered as an isotropic metastable fixed point, and small deviations of the incident angle will cause the system to leave this fixed point and get attracted to another anisotropic fixed point. The fact that the observed transition from isotropic to anisotropic scaling is rather continuous indicates that the system (for θ ion ≠ 69°) has not yet reached its final state and the determined scaling exponents are not the asymptotic but rather some intermediate ones.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Scattering diagram of the Si(100) surface recorded after 240 s of sputtering at θ ion = 67°.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,180.12,676.14,235.26,80.88" type="bitmap" /></figure>
