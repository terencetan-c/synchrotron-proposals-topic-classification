<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The use of genetically modified strains of single cell organisms corresponds to a promising strategy concerning the development of sensitive and h ighly selective biosensors for measuring bioavailable toxic metal ions at environmentally relevant concentrations. However, to fully understand the cell functioning under natural conditions it is necessary to utilize a variety of biochemical, molecular, and imaging techniques. In this report we summarize results obtained by examining single cells of various unmodified and transgenic strains of the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by means of X -ray microprobe techniques.</p><p>Micro X-ray fluorescence ( µ-XRF) and micro X -ray absorption spectroscopy (µ-XAS) investigations were performed to gain information on the cellular distribution and on the localized speciation and oxidation state of metals within the organism. Qualitative elemental distribution maps and µ-XANES spectra were obtained for single intact organisms under in-situ condition by using the microprobe setup installed at beamline ID22 at the ESRF. Freeze-dried organisms deposited on ultrapure polymer support films as well as cryo-cooled organisms trapped in micro-capillaries were analysed.</p><p>We have been successful in recording µXRF maps of single intact organisms under in-situ condition for both types of techniques employed, polymer support films as well as cryo-cooled micro-capillaries (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).  Later corresponds to a pioneering implementation of this new sampling strategy, demonstrating highest promises for future investigation of single cells or single cell organisms. Furthermore, we have succeeded in recording µ-XANES spectra of intracellular metal species.</p><p>Our combined µ-XRF and µ-XANES investigations revealed a close link between the internalized toxic metal concentrations and the metabolism of the macro nutrients as well as trace elements. For illustration, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows a comparison between qualitative elemental distribution maps (µ-XRF maps) for control cultures and for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exposed to aqueous nickel. Clearly, an accumulation of Ni within the cell can be established. Further, the internalization of Ni is accompanied by a simultaneous uptake of Cu and by the expelling of K.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows µXANES spectra of intracellular metal species. The observed metal speciation within the cell is evidently different from the original speciation present within the growth media. Most noticable, for the redox-sensitive As anion electron transfer reactions induced by Chlamy. reinh. were observed.</p><p>Investigating transgenic organisms, we observed similar responses. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Fig. 1: Intact single cell organism within micro capillary.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,470.88,598.40,91.68,165.84" type="bitmap" /></figure>
