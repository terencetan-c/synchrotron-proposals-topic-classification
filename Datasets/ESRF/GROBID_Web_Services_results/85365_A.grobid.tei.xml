<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Part of the obtained results have been included in the recently published paper: Bugaev et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2018, doi: 10.1021/acs.jpcc.7b11473 Abstract: The presence of a core/shell behavior in Pd nanoparticles (NPs) during the formation of the metal-hydride phase has recently been highlighted combining X-ray absorption and scattering experiments [J. <ref type="bibr">Phys. Chem. C 2017, 121, 18202]</ref>. In this work, we focus on the formation of the carbide phase in the bulk region and on the surface of supported palladium NPs because it affects the catalytic activity and selectivity in hydrogenation reactions. We present in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy study of carbide formation and decomposition in 2.6 nm palladium nanoparticles supported on carbon during exposure to acetylene, hydrogen, and their mixtures at 100 °C, taken as a representative temperature for hydrogenation reactions. Fourier analysis of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra was used to determine the average Pd-Pd bond distance in the NPs, reflecting the formation of bulk palladium carbide, while theoretical calculation of X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) using the finite difference method allowed us to determine the PdC y stoichiometry in the bulk region and at the surface of the nanoparticles. The difference in the XANES and EXAFS results indicated different behavior of bulk and surface carbide formation. In particular, exposure to pure acetylene leads to the immediate formation of surface Pd-C bonds and much slower growth of bulk carbide, resulting in the increase of Pd-Pd bond distance with respect to pure metallic palladium nanoparticles by only ∼0.6% after 1 h of exposure. Vacuum conditions at 100 °C did not affect the carbide structure of both the bulk and surface of the NPs. However, exposure to H 2 at 100 °C cleans the surface of palladium, removing surface Pd-C bonds, without decomposing bulk carbide. After second exposure to acetylene, this fraction of lost Pd-C bonds is immediately restored, and the bulk carbide phase continues growing. Thus, we showed how the combination of near-edge and extended structures of the absorption spectra can be utilized to determine the properties of surface and bulk regions of palladium nanoparticles, which showed different behavior in formation of the Pd-C bonds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Description of the experimental procedure and data analysis.</head><p>The idea of this proposal was to monitor core-shell structure of palladium carbide phase upon exposure of palladium nanoparticles to acetylene, ethylene and their mixtures with hydrogen. We used 3 types of samples: 1 nm particles that are considered to have only shell, 2.6 nm particles that can be virtually divided to core and shell regions, and bulk palladium that is considered not to have any shell. All the samples were exposed to acetylene at 50 and 100 °C, ethylene at 50 and 100 °C, and the mixture of ethylene with hydrogen at 80 °C. After formation of carbide phase the samples were exposed to hydrogen to test the stability of these carbides. The process of carbide formation and decomposition was monitored by simultaneous X-ray absorption and X-ray diffraction. First shell Fourier analysis was performed for the EXAFS data. Rietveld refinement was done for diffraction data. In addition, XANES spectra were analyzed by the following approach. We took the palladium carbide spectrum obtained in acetylene and subtracted from it a spectrum of pure palladium nanoparticles. The we used this difference signal to fit difference spectra (carbide minus pure) of all other difference spectra thus quantifying the degree of carbonization. The difference spectrum was also fitted by theoretically calculated spectra and the C/Pd ration was obtained. The result of XANES, EXAFS and XRPD analysis are presented below in Section 3 with comments written in the caption of each figure. Analysis of some data is still in progress. In particular, all the figures report the data for 2.6 nm particles only. To make EXAFS and XRPD results comparable with each other, we report not absolute values of interatomic distances and lattice parameters, but their relative increase with respect to pure metallic palladium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Preliminary conclusions.</head><p>From the analysis that have been already performed some interesting conclusions can be already made. First of all we observed the discrepancy between EXAFS and XRPD results: the degree of lattice expansion is systematically smaller in EXAFS than in XRPD. This observation correlates with our previous results obtained for palladium hydride systems (mainly in experiment <ref type="bibr">MA-2530</ref><ref type="bibr">, published in [J. Phys. Chem. C 2017, 121, 18202]</ref>. The possible explanation of this fact if that the creation of "carbon defects" which is the incorporation of carbon atoms into the palladium lattice is more difficult in the surface than in the bulk. Thus, the main goal of the proposal, to reveal core-shell structure of PdC y particles is already achieved. But more detailed analysis is of course required. Then, we observed that at 50 °C the lattice expansion is ~ 3 times smaller than at 100 °C, which means that less carbon can be introduced inside the lattice. However, XANES spectra, which are sensitive to the amount of Pd-C bonds, indicate that C/Pd ratio is lowered by only ~ 1.5 times. The possible explanation of this fact is that at lower temperature we observe surface adsorbed acetylene and ethylene molecules, that do not increase lattice parameter, but do contribute to the XANES region. Some expected but still important results are that 1) the carbide formation in ethylene is slower than in acetylene, and 2) the carbide formation at high temperatures is faster. Finally, the most surprising result was that carbide can continue to form from the already adsorbed acetylene, even if the sample is left in He (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).        </p></div>
