<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Al (oxy)hydroxide e.g. boehmite ( -AlOOH), silica (SiO2) and ferric iron nanoparticles are commonly found in mine drainage areas, acid rain effected forest environments and hot spring deposits. They form by the neutralisation of acidic or basic surface and groundwater containing dissolved Al, Si or Fe species. Al species (e.g. Al(H2O)63+) in groundwater are known to be toxic to tree roots and colloidal Al (oxy)hydroxide precipitates in surface water can cause significant environmental damage to fish populations and aquatic vegetation. Al, Si and Fe (oxyhydr)oxide nanoparticles can also sorb toxic contaminants (e.g. As5+, Zn) from solution during and after formation causing a significant reduction in aqueous-phase trace element concentrations. Therefore, to understand the effects of these phases in the natural environment it is important to understand their formation mechanisms and kinetics and the means by which they sequester contaminant ions.</p><p>The hydrolysis of aluminium, silica and iron in solution was studied using a stopped-flow reaction cell and a newly developed flow-through reaction cell. The formation of poorly order iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles were characterised as a function of temperature (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Experiments were performed at 4ºC and 10ºC, to complete a full temperature series from 4-50ºC (other temperature experiments performed during previous DUBBLE beamtime). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref> shows time resolved SAXS data for the formation of poorly ordered ferric oxyhydroxide nanoparticles at 10ºC. The data is of a high quality, accurate particle size (fig1b) and shape information can be obtained. The data will also allow a detailed examination of the formation energetics (i.e. activation energies of nucleation and growth) of these phases.</p><p>0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Time (seconds) Rg(Å) 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 0.18 q (Å-1) ln(Intensity) (a.u.) 120 sec. 180 sec. 240 sec. 300 sec 360 sec. 420 sec. 480 sec. 540 sec. 600 sec. 660 sec. 720 sec. Al oxyhydroxide formation was characterised using an automated base titration system which used a flow through reaction cell to monitor the formation of nanoparticles as the pH of a 0.1 M Al(NO 3 ) 3 was raised by the addition of 0.1 M NaOH. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the invariant and radius as a function of pH determined form the SAXS data. The formation of scattering particles/ solution complexes begins at pH≈4.5 and are stable until pH 5.5. The invariant and particle size then increase rapidly as precipitation occurs. The colloid then remains stable until pH 9.5 where the particle size again increases probably due to recrystallisation at high pH The nucleation and growth of amorphous silica particles was also studied as a function of pH to model the formation of silica from silica enriched (0.1M Si) natural waters associated with hot spring deposition of silica in volcanic environments. Analysis of this data is currently on going.</p><p>0.0E+00 4.0E-05 8.0E-05 1.2E-04 1.6E-04 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 9.5 10.5 11.5 pH Invariant (a.u.) 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 Rg (Å)</p><p>Invariant (a.u.)
