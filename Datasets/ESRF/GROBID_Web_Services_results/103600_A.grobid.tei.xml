<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Julie Villanova ( email: julie.villanova@esrf.fr ) Olga Stamati ( email: olga.stamati@esrf.fr ) Laser additive manufacturing of Nickel-based superalloys three-dimensionally prints customized and complex geometries layer-by-layer, but greatly suffers from the solidification cracking during repeatedly melting and solidifying. Ceramic nanoparticles introduced into metal matrices provide an intriguing route to solve cracking issue; however, the mechanism of nanoparticles with a dense uniform dispersion remains unknown. Here, we propose to apply high-energy nano-tomography to 3D characterize the dispersed nanoparticles in metal matrices.</p><p>The effect of processing parameters of laser AM process on the nanoparticle dispersion will be explored. The deformation behavior of metal-nanoparticle composites will be investigated. Consequently, the mechanism of nanoparticle dispersion will be revealed and provide guidelines for processing optimization and improvement.</p><p>For this experiment, we have tested two types of samples as follows: HEO with/without high pressure treatment; ZrCuAgAl with/without high pressure tortion treatment.</p><p>We have done the nano-CT measurements. Thanks to the extreme bright and high-quality beam, the measurements were very successful and we have obtained high-quality datasets of our measured samples. For the 25 nanometer spatial resolution, we can clearly observe the internal structure of our measured samples. There are different fine structure, like the distribution and size and morphology of internal defects due to the processing parameters. We are analyzing the details and plan to prepare one manuscript for submission to a leading journal.</p><p>But we have these samples left for microXANES and microXRD measurements. If we continue finishing these measurements, the atomic-level microstructure-property correlation could be obtained. There is one small issue about the artificial rings for the dataset reconstruction.</p><p>We plan to resolve this issue in the next-round beamtime experiments at the delicate beamtime.</p></div>			</div>
