<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>C 1 2 1. Crystals had two ligands bound to a Saga P domain dimer per assymetric unit. The complex structures were solved by molecular replacement (MR) using the native Saga P domain monomer structure as the initial model. The composition and overall structural topology of Saga P--domain were well conserved among all complex structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Saga P domain--A--trisaccharide complex</head><p>Dataset for a single crystal of A--trisacchaaride bound Saga P domain was processed at 1.28Å resolution with completeness 92.1%. The matthew co--efficient for this crystal was 2.15 that corresponded to 42.76% solvent content. The electron density difference map (Fo--Fc) for bound A--trisacchaaride was observed after molecular replacement. Refinement led to the Rwork and Rfree values 0.1920 and 0.2090, respectively, and well-defined electron density for all saccharide rings. The electron density map (2Fo--Fc) map for the terminal fucose ring was strongest while that for the other two saccharide rings was weaker progressively. Further refinement to reduce R--factors is in progress.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Saga P domain--B--trisaccharide complex</head><p>Dataset for a single crystal of B--trisacchaaride bound Saga P domain was processed at 1.25Å resolution with completeness 97.2%. The matthew co--efficient for this crystal was 2.15 that corresponded to 42.73% solvent content. The Fo--Fc map for all the saccharide rings of bound B--trisacchaaride was observed after molecular replacement. Refinement led to the Rwork and Rfree values 0.1334 and 0.1578, respectively. The 2Fo--Fc map for a flexible loop between residues 391--395 was poorely defined in HBGAs bound and unbound Saga P domain structures. Interestingely, two different orientations of this loop region had been observed in this complex structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Saga P domain--Lewis a --trisaccharide</head><p>Dataset for a single crystal of Lewis a --trisaccharide bound Saga P domain was processed at 1.59Å resolution with completeness 98.3%. The matthew co--efficient for this crystal was 2.18 that corresponded to 43.51% solvent content. The Fo--Fc map for only the terminal fucose ring of bound Lewis a --trisaccharide was observed after molecular replacement. Refinement led to the Rwork and Rfree values 0.1860 and 0.2098, respectively. The 2Fo--Fc map for the remaining two saccharide rings of Lewis a -trisaccharide was so weak that saccharides could not be fitted in.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Saga P domain--Lewis b --tetrasaccharide</head><p>Dataset for a single crystal of Lewis b --tetrasaccharide bound Saga P domain was processed at 1.38Å resolution with completeness 99.3%. The matthew co--efficient for this crystal was 2.15 that corresponded to 42.72% solvent content. The Fo--Fc map for all the saccharide rings of bound Lewis b --tetrasaccharide was observed after molecular replacement. Refinement led to the Rwork and Rfree values 0.1602 and 0.1860, respectively. Further refinement is in progress to gain optimal R--factors. In this complex structure, the loop region between the residues 291--295 interacted directly with Lewis fucose Lewis b --tetrasaccharide, playing a crucial role in stabliizng binding of Lewis b -tetrasaccharide in HBGA binding pocket. In addition, this interaction also reduced flexibility of this loop that resulted in a well--defined electron density for this region.</p></div>

The matthew co--efficient for this crystal was 2.18 that corresponded to 43.49% solvent content. The Fo--Fc map of bound Lewis Y --trisaccharide was observed after molecular replacement. Refinement led to the Rwork and Rfree values 0.1908 and 0.2030, respectively, and well--defined electron density for all saccharide rings. The 2Fo--Fc map for the terminal fucose ring was strongest while that for the other three saccharide rings was weaker progressively.
