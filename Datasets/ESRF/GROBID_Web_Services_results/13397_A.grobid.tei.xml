<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>We have performed XAFS measurements on Eu(II), Eu(III), Lu(III) and Sr(II) aqua ions in solutions and crystals. Eu(II) was one of the few cations for which the hydration structure has not been established in aqueous solution, neither for the first nor for second shell.</p><p>A multipurpose X-ray absorption cell (LURE) was used for in-situ XAFS measurements of sealed, oxygen free solutions in the transmission mode. The measurements were done at different optical lengths (1 to 2 mm for Eu; 1.5 mm for Lu and 4 mm for Sr) to estimate the saturation effect on the white line amplitude.</p><p>The XAFS spectra of the Eu L 3 -edge (6976 eV; scan 6900-7650 eV), Lu L 3 -edge (9244 eV; scan 9150 -10400 eV) and Sr K-edge (16105 eV; 16 000-17 000 eV) have been measured for the aqueous solutions at RT and for the referenced crystals at different temperatures. The synchrotron radiation was monochromatized using the Si(111) doublecrystal monochromator and harmonic rejection was achieved by slightly detuning the two crystals from the parallel alignment. Experimental spectra were recorded by two ionization chambers (He+N 2 mixture for Ln and He+Ar mixture for Sr measurements) with variable steps in the wave vector range 0.025 Å -1 , count rate 1 s per point. The energy resolution (FWHM) was 0.7 eV (Si(111)) at Eu L 3 -edge. The Eu(II) and Eu(III) L 3 -edge XANES measurements (white line amplitudes) have clearly demonstrated that sealed oxygen free samples of Eu(II) (0.1M) aqueous solutions are stable in the cell (LURE) from pH 1 to 5 for at least 10h. XANES spectra are very sensitive to small amounts of Eu(III) (~1%) as could be shown after slow oxydation of Eu(II) (addition of a small quantity of O 2 , Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Therefore we are sure, that our EXAFS data was obtained for pure Eu(II) (0.1M, pH=1 and pH=5) aqueous solutions with Eu(III) concentration smaller than 1%. The following XAFS measurements were performed on aqueous solutions: 1. In situ oxidation of Eu(II) to Eu(III) at pH 1 and 5 (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). 2. Eu(II) at pH 1 and 5. (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). 3. Eu(III) at pH 1 and 5 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). 4. Lu(III) at pH 1. 5. Sr(II) at pH 1. Two scan measurements on the crystalline reference compounds at different T: 1. Eu(III) at 20; 50; 100; 200; 300 K. 2. Lu(III) at 20; 50; 100; 200; 300 K. 3. Sr(II) at 20; 50; 100; 200; 300 K.</p><p>The experimental XAFS data were treated by software package 'EDA' (JP) in the new way similar to the one applied previously for high accuracy analysis of the thermal expansion of Ge [to be published in Phys. Rev. <ref type="bibr">Letters 1999]</ref>. The EXAFS was interpreted using the cumulant approach by taking into account the experimental phases and amplitudes from the reference crystals measured at variable temperature.</p><p>The For the first time the hydration structure for the first shell of Eu(II) aqua ion has been established (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). We have observed changes of RDF's when going from the triple charged Eu(III) to the double charged Eu(II) aqua ions (ion-water distances, coordination numbers, etc). High accuracy XAFS measurements and new XAFS data analysis software allowed us to reconstruct the RDF and to compare this RDF with results of MD simulations on Sr(II). The first coordination shell of Eu(II) aqua ions is composed of 7 ± 0.5 water molecules at the distance R(Eu-O)=2.58 ± 0.01Å with a MSRD 0.014 ± 0.002 Å 2 , while that of Sr(II) aqua ions is composed of 7.5 ± 0.5 water molecules at the distance R(Sr-O)=2.595 ± 0.005 Å with a MSRD σ σ σ σ 2 = 0.012 ± 0.002 Å 2 . We confirm structural similarity between Eu(II) and Sr(II) in aqueous solution. The Eu-O w -distance found by our investigation is 0.02 Å smaller than that of Sr(II). Therefore, it is in agreement with the known ionic radius difference between Eu(II) and Sr(II).</p><p>We have also observed for the first time the temperature dependence of structural and dynamic parameters for the studied aqua ions in the crystals. These data are important for a more careful analysis of structural and dynamic parameters for the studied aqua ions in the solutions and for analysis of kinetic data obtained by our NMR experiments.
