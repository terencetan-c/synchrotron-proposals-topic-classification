<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the experiment we studied the Sm valence as a function of temperature and field at ambient and applied pressure. The demonstration of XAS up to 30 T for the sudy of the Sm-Valence state at the L3-edge in a nonmagnetic miniature high pressure cell is by itself a new technical development. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a preparation and an absoprtion map of one of the samples inside the cell, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows some of the first results as a function of field and temperature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>1) At zero field as a function of temperature we observed the reduction of the Sm valence in qualitative agreement with the literature at ambient pressure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 b</ref>), and at 1.9 GPa. 2) As a function of field at low temperatures, we did not observe a significant variation of the valence state, neither at ambient pressure (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 c</ref>), nor under applied pressure of 1.9 GPa (decreasing to 0.9 GPa at the end of the experiment) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2 d</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preliminary conclusions</head><p>• XAS data of excellent quality can be obtained in pulsed high magnetic fields up to 30T inside the miniature high pressure cell. • Very small Valence changes can in principle be detected.</p><p>• We did not observe any sinificant evolution of the Sm valence up to 30T, neither at ambient pressure, nor at applied pressure, in the measuremets shown, even though a reduction of the gap may be expected from resistivity data in the literature. Furthermore, resistivity measurements already show a significant reduction in resistivity at ambient pressure within the field range of this experiment and long before the supposed gap closure around 89 T. • The literature can be interpreted that applied pressure would allow one to reduce the correlation gap sufficiently, so that the field induced closure could be observed within the field range acessible in this expwriment. • It would be important to confirm our observation a) with another field dependence closer to the gapclosure at 5.5 GPa, and b) to probe the magnetic state with XMCD, as the degree of localisation of the 4f electrons is key to understanding the nature of the correlation gap in SmB6. • An observation of the field induced closure of the gap through resititution of the ambient-P-T valence state would be the first microscopic observation of the field induced gap closure in SmB6. On the other hand, confirmation of the observed trend would either point to a different nature of the field induced closure or magnetic state. • One issue we faced was the stability of the complicated loading of the cells equipped with the special composite gasket and thin windows on both sides. We are working on inproving this. Another issue was that we did not have a pressure measurement at low Temperatures inside the cryostat. We therefore have taken steps to implement in-situ pressure measurements using a long focal distance pressure ruby luminescence setup developed at ESRF.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Non-magnetic miniature high-pressure cell. a) One of the preparations.
