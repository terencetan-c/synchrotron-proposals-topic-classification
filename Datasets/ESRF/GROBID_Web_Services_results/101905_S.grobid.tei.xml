<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Hantaan virus is a dangerous human pathogen those segmented negative-stranded RNA genome is replicated and transcribed by a virally-encoded multi-functional polymerase. We recently observed that, in the absence of viral RNA, a fraction Hantaan polymerase sample oligomerizes in different multimers in equilibrium, ranging from dimers to multimers. A krios session was necessary to determine their structure as they are minoritarian, corresponding to 10 % of the particles for the dimers and 2% of the particles for the hexamers, the rest of the polymerase being monomeric (monomeric structure already determined by us).</p><p>The data collection of 14.650 movies at 105.000 x magnification performed on the ESRF Krios CM01 equipped with a Gatan K3 allowed to derive the high-resolution structure of symmetric dimers at 3 Å resolution and symmetric hexamers, composed of trimer of dimers, at 3.3 Å resolution. Multimerization of apo polymerases induces the stabilization of every polymerase domain, including the C-terminal region that notably contains a C-terminal domain involved in polymerase multimerization and a lariat region that contributes to the polymerase global steadying. The structure also reveals the location of the cap-binding domain that is essential to transcription initiation. This suggests the potential involvement of the multimers as storage systems that would stabilize the otherwise flexible C-terminal domains. These results significantly advance our understanding of Hantaan polymerase oligomerization and will be key to define antiviral compounds to counteract these life-threatening viruses.</p><p>We would like to really thank all the people who are maintaining and operating the ESRF CM01 Krios, in particular Lindsay McGregor who was our local contact for this shift.</p><p>We are in the process of writing an article relating these results and thus request this summary to remain confidential.</p></div>
