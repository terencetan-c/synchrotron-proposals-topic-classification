<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OBJECTIVES -PURPOSE</head><p>Since their foundation in 1832 Winsor &amp; Newton (W&amp;N) traded on their reputation for high quality durable products. This study was carried out to evaluate whether their yellow lead chromate pigments suffered similar degradation as reported elsewhere [please, see references in our proposal to the works of Janssens, <ref type="bibr">Monico et al.,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>. Our research of 19 th c. W&amp;N chrome yellow manufacturing processes, enabled us to select the pigment formulations expected to most likely undergo degradation <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. A set of paint reconstructions together with samples from historic chrome yellow oil paint tubes and µ-samples from paintings of the 19 th c. Portuguese artist, Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso, were irradiated in a Xenon-light apparatus (λ irr &gt;320 nm). The photochemical ageing was studied by synchrotron radiation, including µ-XRF, Cr and S K-edge µ-XANES and µ-FTIR, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. The purpose of this experiment is to develop a light susceptibility index to predict the stability of chrome yellow paints using the ratio variation of Cr 3+ /Cr 6+ obtained by Cr K-edge µ-XANES, and to get a deeper insight into the degradation processes occuring in chrome yellow paint systems <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. The combined use of the synchrotron-based techniques show to be indispensable to accomplish these goals. EXPERIMENT A total of 32 samples were analysed during this experiment: 4 µ-samples from Amadeo's paintings (2 artificially aged), 3 samples from historic oil paint tubes, 11 historically accurate oil and poly(vinyl acetate) paint reconstructions and 14 PVAc paint references of lead chromate monoclinic and orthorhombic mixed in different proportions with common additives: chalk, gypsum and barytes. Samples with different irradation times were analysed; HART samples by Cr and S K-edge µ-XANES with a macro-beam (200 m) and a micrometric beam (0.3×0.8 μm² ) was used for µ-samples from Amadeo's, historic oil paint tubes and paint reconstructions. Some of the samples were prepared on site as embedding-free thin cross-sections using the SES method (Sample Enclosing System). µ-FTIR maps of Amadeo's cross-sections were acquired in ATR mode and other samples, mounted as thin cross-sections, were analysed in transmission mode, with a beam size of 88 μm 2 . Data analysis was performed using OMNIC, PyMCA and ATHENA software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main results</head><p>By means for Cr K-edge µ-XANES analysis it was possible to establish a light susceptibility index for chrome yellow oil paint systems and a first assessment of the stability to light of an early W&amp;N Chrome yellow oil paint tube was made. This suggest that it will be possible to compare the behaviour of original materials to reference materials produced through reconstructions <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. A wider set of irradiated historically accurate paints and longer irradiation times is necessary to fully assess the accuracy of the LSI. This experiment is in progress. Overall, the irradiated historically accurate reconstructions and the samples from Amadeo's paintings displayed high stability to light. In the artificially aged Amadeo's samples (t irr = 5250 h) evidence of Cr 3+ compounds being formed was found, however, the degradation process is still in an initial stage and longer irradiation times will be required to fully assess the degradation mechanisms. The oil paint which showed the highest color change (E* = 48.2), after 7750 h of irradiation time, was a reconstruction composed of pure lead chromate with a high extender concentration: 32% of pure monoclinic lead chromate (PbCrO 4 ), 47% of chalk (calcium carbonate, CaCO 3 ) and 21% of gypsum (calcium sulfate dihydrate, CaSO 4 .2H 2 O), Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Importantly, the successful preparation of embedded free thin cross-sections of the oil paint reconstruction mentioned above allowed insight into its degradation mechanims through the combined use of SR µ-XRF, chromium and sulfur K-edge µ-XANES and µ-FTIR, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> [2]. It was possible to detect by µ-XANES not only the reduction of lead chromate Cr 6+ but also of calcium sulphate S 6+ , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> and <ref type="figure">C</ref>. It is suggested that the redox reactions are linked. µ-FTIR imaging disclosed reaction pathways, intermediates and final products that provide a breakthrough in our understanding of the stability of chrome yellow oil paints; this important result is the subject of a communication that we are preparing for submission <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. Calcium oxalate monohydrate (CaC 2 O 4 .H 2 O) was detected by µ-FTIR at the surface and near chalk-rich areas at the interior of the oil paint, and we think that this final product is key for the understanding of the degradation mechanism of chrome yellow in an oil matrix, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>. Samples from the historic chrome yellow oil paint tubes also show the presence of oxalate compounds (by µ-FTIR), however, its precise identification was not possible for the irradiation times studied. Further investigation will be conducted in order to fully assess the role of metal oxalates in the degradation mechanism of chrome yellow oil paints. Our experiments conducted at ID21 provide the foundation work for this study. OUTPUTS [1] V. Otero, J. V. Pinto, L. Carlyle, M. Vilarigues, M. Cotte, M. J.
