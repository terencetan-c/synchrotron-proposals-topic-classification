<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>A resonant X-ray scattering study at the Mn K-edge of the charge-ordered perovskite Nd 0.5 Sr 0.5 MnO 3 was performed to prove the main goals of our structural model <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> proposed to explain the charge-orbital ordering transition in manganites with Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ ratio equal to 1.</p><p>(0 3 0) charge-order and (0 5/2 0) orbital order reflections, in the Pbnm setting, were observed in a singlecrystal cut in the [001] cubic plane at T=70 K, well below the charge-ordering transition temperature T co ∼150 K. Twin mosaic was inevitable in the crystal so both, (0 2 0) and (2 0 0) domains, were detected. The characteristic dependence of the intensity of these superlattice reflections on the azimuthal angle and on the polarization of the incident beam (by means of a Cu (220) analyzer) were investigated in detail at fixed temperature.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the intensity of the (0 5/2 0) orbital ordering reflection as a function of the photon energy for the π-polarized scattering beam. A maximum is shown at 6552 eV, within 1 eV respect to the Mn Kabsorption edge. A π periodicity of the intensity on the azimuthal angle φ has been found at the resonance and no σ-polarized scattered intensity has been detected. Moreover, no (5/2 0 0) peak was observed in agreement with a previous study of Nakamura et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. On the other hand, for charge-ordering (3 0 0) scattering, either σ-σ or σ-π contributions have been detected, as it is shown in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>(a) and 2(b), respectively, for two φ values corresponding to the maximum and minimum resonant intensity.  The σ-polarized scattered intensity shows φ dependence with π periodicity for both, (3 0 0) and (0 3 0) reflections, which also agrees with that previously reported by Nakamura et al. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> for the (0 3 0) one. Besides, the energy dependence of the intensity of (3 0 0) (or (0 3 0)) resonant reflection has been found to strongly depend on the azimuthal angle value and a shift of ∼1.5 eV is observed for the energy resonance between the φ values correspondent to the maximum and minimum intensity. For the π-polarization, instead, only the (3 0 0) resonant reflection was detected but the same dependence on the photon energy as for the σpolarization was observed. However, a π/2 periodicity is found for the scattering intensity in this case. A very remarkable feature was the fact that the intensity of the (3 0 0) resonant reflection is different from zero for off-resonance photon energies in the σ-π channel. This characteristic is usually related to the presence of resonant magnetic scattering reflections, although in this particular case, it seems to be a much more complex effect. The main experimental results of this study are perfectly described within the framework of our structural model <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> based on the presence of two Mn atoms with different local geometrical structure (a tetragonal distorted and a regular MnO 6 octahedral environments, respectively) without taking into account any charge or orbital ordering. However, more detailed resonant X-ray scattering experiments are necessary to give a complete description of this system, above all, regarding the presence of non-resonant σ-π intensity for the charge-order reflection and the possibility of some charge disproportionate (δ).</p><p>[1] J. <ref type="bibr">García et al., J.
