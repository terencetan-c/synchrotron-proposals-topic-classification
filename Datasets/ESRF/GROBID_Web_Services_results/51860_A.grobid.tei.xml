<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>High pressure polymorphism of Mn(BH 4 ) 2 was also studied during this experiment. Two samples of Mn(BH 4 ) 2 were used with LiCl impurity and with NaBH 4 impurity. We found that Mn(BH 4 ) 2 behaves similarly in both experiments, undergoing two phase transitions: the first phase transition occurs at approximately the same pressure for both experiments, whereas the pressure value for the second phase transition lies in a wider range. As will be discussed below, we suggest the impurity to be responsible for such behavior. The first phase transition Mn(BH 4 ) 2 experiences in the range of 0.5-2.0 GPa, which goes with a coexistence of two phases: the initial phase and the emerged high-pressure phase. The second phase transition occurs between 8.5 and 11.5 GPa, only with a slight change in the diffraction pattern; but appearance of new superstructure peaks allowed us to identify the second high-pressure phase. The structure determination revealed that that the first high-pressure phase of Mn(BH 4 ) 2 is isostructural to a high-pressure phase of Mg(BH 4 ) 2 , i.e., δ-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 . This new phase, which we named δ-Mn(BH 4 ) 2 by analogy with δ-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 , was refined in P4 2 nm, by using crystal structure of δ-Mg(BH 4 ) 2 as an initial model (replacing Mg for Mn atom). The structure of α-Mn(BH 4 ) 2 is characterized by a significant amount of empty space; during the first phase transition, which is the first-order transition, α-Mn(BH 4 ) 2 collapses, losing 17% of volume, and rearranges into δ-Mn(BH 4 ) 2 . As its Mg analog, δ-Mn(BH 4 ) 2 consists of two interpenetrated Mn(BH 4 ) 2 frameworks, similar to the Cu 2 O structure, showing no empty voids in the structure and has a volumetric density of hydrogen of 125 g H 2 /L at a pressure of 1 GPa. The second phase to δ'-Mn(BH 4 ) 2 transition in both experiments occurs near 8.5-11.5 GPa and results in a few additional new peaks in the diffraction pattern that indicate a superstructure, emerging mostly due to the ordering of hydrogen atoms. Structure of δ'-Mn(BH 4 ) 2 is very similar to the first high-pressure phase and is comprised of two interpenetrated Mn(BH 4 ) 2 frameworks as well, with the ordering of hydrogen atoms being more pronounced. The latter is the reason for a larger unit cell and the appearance of new superstructure peaks.</p><p>[1] P. Schouwink, M. B. Ley, A. Tissot, H. Hagemann,T. R. Jensen, L'. Smrčok, R.
