<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to determine Fe and Fe-Ni alloys structures and elastic properties at P-T conditions as close as possible to real inner core conditions. Our first concern was to define a strong experimental procedure. We had to set a sample loading geometry optimized for laser heating in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), i.e. a good thermal insulation of the sample and a low reactivity. This is crucial since to actually measure thermoelastic properties of Fe and FeNi, a pressure scale is needed to quantify the thermal pressure produced during laser heating. A very good candidate for that purpose is MgO: its cubic B1 structure is stable up to around 500 GPa, the cubic structure is ideal to estimate non-hydrostatic stresses during the experiment and its PVT equation of state is one of the most documented in the literature. The problem is that this adds oxygen to the system, and we were wondering if that could be a source of oxidation for Fe compounds. The reactivity of a metal depends also on the particles size: even gold is highly oxidizable at room pressure and 300 K when the particle size is low (around 1 micron and less).</p><p>The sample loading geometry represented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> takes into account all these issues: NaCl layers are used as thermal insulators and pressure transmitting medium. The metal sample consists of one piece of metal foil initially flattened between a diamond and the rhenium gasket. The typical size of the sample was 10 or 20 µm in diameter, 5-7 µm in thickness. A thin layer of MgO powder is loaded in contact with the sample. This way, the metal particle size is maximized, the contact surface between MgO and the metal is minimized and thermal insulation is insured.</p><p>We started our first run following that procedure. We loaded the DAC with all the materials initially stored in an air oven. Before heating, MgO indicated a pressure equals to 20.2 GPa, compatible with NaCl and Fe cell parameters. After heating, MgO unit cell volume was much bigger and indicated 8.9 GPa, while NaCl and Fe cell parameters barely didn't change. This can be easily explained by a solid solution of FeO in MgO. If we follow [1], this change of unit cell volume corresponds to Fe 0.6 Mg 0.4 O. Thus a huge amount of iron has been oxidized, and we immediately suspected water to be the responsible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Schematic view of the loading geometry used in this study</head><p>We decided to dry NaCl and MgO powders during 12 hours at 625 °C and 1000 °C, respectively. They were then stored in a vacuum desiccator. All the loadings were done in a glove bag under Ar. Following this new procedure, the results were totally different: there were no more undesirable changes in MgO unit cell volume before and after heating. A very strict control of the hydration of the samples is thus mandatory for this experiment, increasing dramatically the loading difficulty (with diamond culet sizes down to 75 µm, gasket holes down to 20 µm).</p><p>In order to compare and understand the experimental results, it was very important to start with pure Fe. We collected approximately 200 data points between 55 and 165 GPa and up to 3000 K. In this P-T range, the stable Fe phase is hcp. The whole dataset is represented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. A good P-V-T resolution, comparable to the one already achieved in [2] was observed and will definitely lead to a detailed PVT equation of state for hcp iron. This is also encouraging for our future works. No dramatic change of the cullet sizes are needed to reach 200 GPa, and this should be easily done. Reaching 300 GPa is a much more ambitious step: specific tests are currently done by our groups to make it possible.</p><p>We have also conducted runs with Fe 0.8 Ni 0.2 samples, but this is only preliminary work, up to 90 GPa and 2500 K.
