<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In the present work, three oxide materials, namely monoclinic (m) ZrO2, cubic (c) Gd:ZrO2, and c-Gd2O3 doped with 50-300 ppm of the minor actinide Cm 3+ , were investigated using HERFD-XANES. The aim of the study was to elucidate the origin of an unusually strong perturbation of the electronic levels of Cm 3+ in these host materials as determined by luminescence spectroscopy. Such perturbation may arise from e.g. an unusually short Cm-O bond in the host phases or from a covalent character of the Cm-O bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For comparison, a solid sample of GdPO4 containing 50 ppm Cm was measured as a representative for an almost ionic (non-covalent) solid phase, showing a very low crystal field splitting of the incorporated Cm 3+ ion (of similar magnitute to the Cm 3+ aqua ion), Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. To date, there are no HERFD-XANES data for curium at the M4 or M5 edges, and an important aspect of the study was to optimize and test the experimetnal set-up at the BM20. Typically, the M4 edge of actinide lements is measured (not M5) as the transition probability as well as the resolution are greater. Unfortunately, Cm M4 is not accessible with the Johann-type spectrometer as no analyzers exists for the Cm M4 energy range. Thus, the M5 edge was probed instead. The first effort in recording Cm M5 edge data in high resolution at a distance of 1 m was not successful. No Cm was visible in this measurement geometry at the energy of approximately 3950 eV. At the Cm L3 edge (18970 eV) the efficiency of the spectrometer is not optimal, and no Cm signal could be detected at a distance of 1 m. Moving the spectrometer to 0.5 m increased the signal intensity in the monoclinic ZrO2 sample. However, the background from Zr was so high (due to edge overalp, as the Zr K-edge is just below the Cm L3-edge), implying that at these low concentrations, Cm cannot be measured in Zr-containing systems. Instead, Cm signal could be collected from the Zr-free samples, namely the cubic phase Gd2O3 (assuming strong covalent contribution in the sample) and the ionic GdPO4 monazite. In additon, Gd L3-edge data were collected from the same samples. The XANES data are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. The Gd L3-edge data show clear differences between the two samples. There are two peaks at the main edge transition for Gd2O3 and a single peak for GdPO4. This is due to the crystal field splitting of the Gd 5d states in the particular local environment. The assumption is, that the broadening of the Cm L3-data for Gd2O3 in comparison to the GdPO4 and the clear splitting, which is similar to the Gd L3 data, has the same origin. The 6d states of Cm in the Gd2O3 matrix split in the same way as in Gd 5d states in the oxide structure.</p><p>To resolve the origin of the splitting electronic structure calculations are planned. Further measurements on samples with higher Cm doping would also be necessary, to probe the Cm environment in the Zr-containing phases and to confirm the observations in the current study. Further, a higher Cm concentration may allow for measurements at the M5 edge, and this way gain access to the 5f electrons in the system. Only then, a direct comparison of the luminescence and XANES data can be made.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Emission spectra of the Cm 3+ aqua ion and Cm 3+doped crystalline solid phases containing 50 ppm Cm.</figDesc></figure>
