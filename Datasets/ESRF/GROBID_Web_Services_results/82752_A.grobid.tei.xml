Compared to the proof-ofprinciple experiment performed previously, (fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) in this study we used for the first time the new version of the half cell which contains a third (reference) electrode. This allows us to have a better estimation of the actual potential of the other half cell. At the same time, more patient cycling was performed. Each Cyclic Voltammetry cycle lasts for 20 min, which contributes to the long measurement time. With the 9 shifts that were given, we were able to measure a total of 3 samples, all of which consist of planar Si anode. We did not measure the nanoparticle or the nanowire sample, as we realized during the experiment that there were still a lot important things to be learnt from the simplest model system. The 3 measurements (samples) constitutes hence a series of operando study on planar Si anodes, each designed to improve upon its predecessor, to answer a specific question, with a different cycling strategy. Below is shown a short summary on the last sample. During each CV cycle we used timescan at an off-Bragg (-0.033Â° in theta) position to monitor the nucleation of defects. Below is shown some FFDXM images of the second cycle (during the first cycle no changes were observed). Five different stages were observed. (Point O to A, 100 mV&lt; E &lt; 700mV, I &lt; 0) The lithiation occurs already for E &lt; 700mV, althought no structural changes were observed (as we formed mostly amorphous LiSi alloy). (Point A to B, E &lt; 100mV, I &lt; 0) As soon as E drops below 100 mV, two defects were observed (not present in cycle 1), probably due to the formation of a crystalline Li x Si alloy with very high Li composition x (probably Li 22 Si 5 ). With the CV cycle, we only stayed below 100mV for 38 sec, and the intensity at the defected area kept rising during this period. (Point B to C, 100 mV&lt; E &lt; 700mV, I &lt; 0) When E rose again above 100 mV, the defects, especially the one on the right, became less visible on the image, which may be understood as the previously formed Li x Si alloy being transformed into one with lower Li composition (probably Li 13 Si 4 ). (Point C to D, 100 mV&lt; E &lt; 700mV, I &gt; 0) The intensity at the defected area then rose again, this corresponds to the part where we were still below the voltage for lithiation but has a postive current. This phenomenon is still under investigation.</p><p>(Point D to E, E &gt; 700mV, I &gt; 0) As E became larger than 700 mV and with I &gt; 0, the delithiation process began, the defects were still visible though less intense, hinting that the process was not completely reversible (or not completely irreversible).   Starting from cycle 5, we have increased the amount the time we stay below 100 mV. On cycle 6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), some new defect sites were observed. We were able to identify 4 (possibly 6) stages of the process.  With FFDXM, we were able to study the dynamics of defect formation during the operando lithiation and delithiation cycles. By performing 2D mapping in between CV cycles, we were able to study quantitatively the nature of the defects.</p><p>The experiment was a great success, especially considering the relatively short beamtime, the irreverserble nature of operando experiments (had we missed one moment, we would have to repeat it on another sample) and the fact that we were among the first users for this brand new instrument (it takes sometimes missteps to find the optimal measurement strategy). We are also extremely excited about the observation of the very beginning of the structural failure of LiBs with planar Si anodes as well as the observation of the formation of different LiSi alloy during the process.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: new three electrode half cell on ID01</figDesc><graphic coords="2,300.52,452.44,264.24,197.76" type="bitmap" /></figure>

It would appear that the contrast we observed come from tensily strained area (red contour in Fig. 3 left) of the crystalline Li x Si surrounded by compressively strained area (blue contour in Fig. 3 left). Cycle 3 (Fig. 3 mid) is very similar to cycle 2, though the variations in intensity during the process were less significant. Hardly any variation was observed in Cycle 4 (Fig 3. right)</figDesc><graphic coords="3,12.17,333.85,549.95,310.25" type="bitmap" /></figure>

We do not yet understand the origin of this incubation period. (Point B to C, E &lt; 100mV, I &lt; 0) Formation of probably Li 22 Si 5 , the intensity at the defected area increased abruptedly. (Point C to D, 100 mV&lt; E &lt; 700mV) The transformation of Li 22 Si 5 into probably Li 13 Si 4 . The intensity at the defected area decreased gradually. (Point D to E, E &gt; 700mV, I &gt; 0) Delithiation: intensity dropped abruptedly.There are hints of a secondary effect (change of slope around point C' and D'), we are still in the progress of understanding this. We then continuously increased the duration for which we stayed below 100 mV to have defect nucleation in the entire FoV. In Fig.5is shown the comparison between the state of the sample after cycle 2 and cycle 10.</figDesc></figure>
