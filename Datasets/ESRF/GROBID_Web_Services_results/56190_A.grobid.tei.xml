<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>XAFS study of structural and magnetic effects induced by intercalation on Gr/Co/Ir systems This experiment studied thin (1-2 nm thick) Co films deposited on Ir(111) substrate with the aim of understanding the fate of Co ions under thermal treatment, up to 900 C. These findings are part of a larger project aimed to understand the role of Graphene (Gr) in determining the structural behavior and the magnetic response of Co film in Gr/Co/Ir(111) films .</p><p>Previous XRD experiments [ihsi778, hc896, hc915] demonstrated the thermal treatment induces structural effects at the Co/Ir interface, x-ray absorption spectroscopy has the aim to reveal these changes from a local perspective, looking at the Co atoms.</p><p>To carry out the experiment we developed a small UHV chamber which can be coupled to the UHV system of the ID03 laboratory and then transferred to the BM23 while keeping the sample under UHV conditions. In this way a 2nm-thick Co film was deposited on the Ir(111) substrate in UHV conditions (P=10 -10 mbar) at the ID03 beamline and characterized by LEED and XPS before its transfer. The sample was then moved to the BM23 where Co K edge XAS measurements were carried out in the near edge region (XANES) treating the sample at progressively high temperatures (500 to 900 o C, 5 min. each) as planned in the proposal. Several scans were measured for each temperature: the sample was rotated by 0.5deg once every 3 scans in order to shift the Bragg peaks along the spectrum allowing one to remove them. For each annealing temperature, once the Bragg peaks were removed, the experimental spectra were averaged up. The results are compared in the figure below. Preliminary ab initio simulations carried out using FEFF 8 program demonstrate that these changes are consistent with the formation of a disordered Co-Ir alloy with approximately 50% Co and Ir.</p><p>Unfortunately we could not carry out all the measurements foreseen in the proposal because the 13-elements Ge detector broke down few days before the experiment and we have been forced to work with a single Si detector. This resulted in an acquisition time almost 10 times longer than planned and we could not complete our experiment. In particular, we were unable to measure the Gr/Co/Ir(111) film.</p><p>However these preliminary results gave important information about the Co-Ir intermixing process. Moreover, this experiment has also pointed out the feasibility of the measurements and gave hints to improve the set up.</p><p>We feel confident that the modifications already planned for the experimental setup and the use of the 13 elements Ge multidetector will ensure reasonable collection time to accomplish the proposed experiment either by rescheduling of the present proposal because of the technical failure of the detector of by resubmitting a new proposal at the next deadline (September 2015).</p><p>A B</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>th of May 2015 to: 18 th of May 2015 Date of report: 01/07/2015 Shifts: Local contact(s): Sakura Pascarelli Received at ESRF: Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): I.
