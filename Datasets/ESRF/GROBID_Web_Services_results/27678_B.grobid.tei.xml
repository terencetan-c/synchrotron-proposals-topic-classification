<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Photosynthetic reaction centers (RC) are membrane pigment-protein complexes which initiate the photosynthetic process. The binding of heavy metals (like Zn and Cd) has been shown to slow the light-induced charge separation within the bacterial RC, which is the primary event of photosynthesis.</p><p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) data at 2.5 Å resolution indicate that Cd and Zn bind at the same location to a cluster formed by AspH124, HisH126 and HisH128. In addition to these three amino acid residues in the case of Zn a water molecule was proposed to interact with the metal <ref type="bibr">(Axelrod et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 97, 1542</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2000)</ref>. Interestingly, recent data suggest that Cd and Ni compete with protons for the same binding site (presumably HisH126 and/or HisH128) <ref type="bibr">(Paddock et al., Biochemistry 42,9626, 2003)</ref>.</p><p>A detailed determination of the local structure is fundamental to shed light into the mechanism which originates the perturbation of charge transfer. For this reason we have performed Zn K-edge X-ray absorption measurements on the GILDA beamline. We have measured a number of RC samples with exogenous Zn at both room and LN temperature and selected reference compounds (Zn-Phthalocyanine, Zn-Porphine and Zn-Heptanedionate). Samples characterized by different Zn/RC ratios were obtained by incubating RCs purified from Rhodobacter sphaeroides in a buffer containing ZnSO 4 at different stoichiometries. Excess free Zn was removed by gel filtration chromatography and Zn/RC ratios were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy of the metal. Measurements were performed on Zn-doped RCs embedded into polyvinyl alcohol films.</p><p>Data analysis of a sample characterized by [Zn]/[RC]≅ 1 has been performed using ab-initio simulations with FEFF and multiparameter fitting (FEFFIT); structural contributions up to the fourth coordination shell and multiple scattering paths (involving three atoms) of significant amplitude have been included; an example of a typical fit is shown in the figure . 

Results for complexes characterized by a Zn to RC stoichiometry close to 1 indicate that Zn 2+ binds two O and two N atoms in the first coordination shell. Higher shell contributions are consistent with a binding cluster formed by two His, one Asp residue and a water molecule. Analysis of complexes characterized by approximately 2 Zn ions per RC reveals a second structurally distinct binding site, involving one O and three N atoms, not belonging to a His residue.</p><p>The local structure obtained for the higher affinity site nicely fits the coordination geometry proposed on the basis of XRD data, but a significant contraction of the first shell is detected. Two possible locations of the second new binding site at the cytoplasmic surface of the RC have benn proposed.</p><p>Based on these results a paper has been submitted and accepted for publication in Biophysical Journal (Biophysical journal Volume 88 March 2005). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>EXAFS spectrum of sample characterized by a Zn to RC stoichiometry close to 1 .
