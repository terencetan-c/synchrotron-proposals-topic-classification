<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXAFS investigation of austenitic alloys nitrided at low temperature</head><p>sample are characteristic for the fcc structure. There are four strong amplitude peaks in FT|χ(k)k 3 | between 1.5 and 6 Å whose distance R are ~2.2, 3.2, 4.2 and 5 Å, respectively. The peaks correspond to metallic neighbors in different coordination shells. The shape of the Kedges for all elements is similar (not shown) which suggests that the chemical environments and geometry are the same for Ni, Fe and Cr. Cr XANES of the ASS nitrided at 550°C has a well-defined edge feature (~5 eV), main peak (~18.8 eV), and a second peak (~32 eV) which almost identical to CrN XANES reported in the literature. The edge is shifted by 0.44 eV as compared to non-nitrided sample indicating that Cr is in the oxidation state similar to Cr 3+ . This corresponds to the formation of the CrN. FT|χ(k)k 3 | shows additional coordination shell closer than any Me-Me which corresponds to N atoms. For the sample nitrided at 400°C, the Cr XANES is very similar to that of the sample nitrided at 550°C. Also the edge shift is close to that of the CrN reference sample. The peaks above the absorption edge are less intense while their positions are slightly shifted to the higher energies. The latter is attributed to slightly smaller lattice parameter, while the smoother shape can be attributed to a lower order of crystallinity. FT|χ(k)k 3 | shows very similar coordination shell structure as that of CrN. The results point out that the Cr in the S phase is in the state similar to that of CrN. Similar analysis of other elements (not shown here) shows that Fe in the S phase is in the environment close to Fe 4 N while Ni is in metallic disordered environment. The results above strongly indicate that the interstitial nitrogen incorporation into ASS at 400°C results in the local decomposition of otherwise homogeneous solid solution of Fe-Ni-Cr, each principal element showing different local environment. This points out that the diffusion of the matrix atoms takes place even at the temperatures as low as 400°C. The fact that no different phases are observed by x-ray diffraction points out that such zones must be small and coherent with the matrix. Such composite structure explains the mechanical properties as well as ferromagnetism of the S phase reported in the literature. These findings show that reactive interstitial diffusion can be used to induce the local decomposition which</p><p>shows a unique set of properties. These results make a part of the PhD thesis of A.</p><p>Martinavičius (under preparation at the moment). The preparation of a publication is planned in the nearest future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists): Gintautas Abrasonis* and Andrius Martinavičius* Institute of Ion Beam Physics and Materials Research, P .O. Box 510119, Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, 01314 Dresden, Germany Report: Chemical environment of the principal constituents (Fe, Ni, Cr) of the austenitic stainless steel (ASS) AISI 316L in the S phase has been investigated by means of x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The S phase has been produced by plasma nitriding at 400°C for 30h. This results in the nitrided layer thickness of ~20 µm and nitrogen nearsurface atomic ratio of ~27 at.%. In order to get some insights into the chemical environment of Fe, Ni, Cr, the XANES and EXAFS spectra of virgin ASS and ASS plasma nitrided at 550°C for 30h have been recorded. The former serves as a reference for Fe, Ni, Cr in fcc metallic state. Nitriding at 550°C induces the precipitation of CrN which serves as a reference for Cr in CrN state.</figDesc></figure>
