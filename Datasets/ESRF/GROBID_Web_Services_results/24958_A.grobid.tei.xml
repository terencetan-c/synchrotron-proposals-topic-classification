The crystals were very small and since then, higher quality crystals have been acquired.</p><p>The CTP synthase crystals tested were still disordered, despite dehydration experiments and diffraction was only seen to 6 Å resolution.</p><p>Crystals of UPRTase from Sulfolobus solfataricus in complex with the regulatory nucleotide GTP were tested, but only poor diffraction was obtained. A dataset from a crystal of Bacillus subtilis UPRTase in a complex with product UMP, was obtained to a resolution of 4 Å. Despite the relative modest resolution it should be possible from these data to determine the quaternary structure and the overall fold of UPRTase from this organism.</p><p>Moreover, data for two projects within this project area not originally described in the application were also collected. These were data on PRPP synthase from spinach, which proved to diffract poorly (8Å reolution) and furthermore data on the tetrameric cytidine deaminase from Bacillus psychrophilus. The latter diffraction data were collected at ID14-4 (as a backup for beamtime allocated to project MX88). A complete data set on these small crystals were obtaned to 2.4 Å resolution and the structure has been determined by molecular replacement and is presently being refined.</p></div>		</body>
