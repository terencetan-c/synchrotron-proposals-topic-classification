<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural study of the human small GTP-binding protein Rab11</head><p>Rab proteins are small GTP binding proteins involved in several different substeps of the intacellular trafficking machinery. Vesicles bud from donor compartments and reach target organelles to which membranes they fuse, releasing their cargoes. Rab proteins regulate specifical targetting and tethering of vesicles to acceptor compartment membranes. Rab11 is implicated in the regulation of the trafficking events in the endocytic pathway at the recycling endosomes. As all other small nucleotide binding proteins it cycles between an 'inactive' GDP-bound conformation and an 'active' GTP-bound form that can bind effectors proteins and thus trasmit a signal or trigger a cellular event. Given the high number of Rab proteins in the cell (more than 40) understanding the structural mechanisms by which each Rab protein is specifically associated to a given pathway, in which it plays a key role, remains a major issue.</p><p>To elucidate these mechanisms we undertook the structural study of the complete GDP/GTP cycle of human Rab11. Structure of Rab11 in complex with GDP have been resolved by virtue of data collected at the ESRF in 2001. Crystals of the GTP-bound form of Rab11 have been obtained and a complete dataset at 1.9 Å was collected on May 17 th , 2002 at beamline ID14-2 (see table for dataset statistics). These data permitted to solve the structure, that is actually under refinement. The current model displays R cryst = 26.4 and R free = 28.6 and is represented in figure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural study of human Interferon-induced guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1)</head><p>The protein GBP1 is induced by interferon γ which is an immuno-modulatory substance and has an antiviral activity <ref type="bibr">(Anderson S. et al. (1999)</ref>, Virology 256, 8-14). Its cellular function is related at the biochemical level to the ability to undergo oligomerisation with a high concentration-dependent GTPase activity <ref type="bibr">(Prakash et al., (2000)</ref>, Nature 403, 567-571). The protein is further characterised among regulatory GTPases by its distinctive ability to hydrolyse GTP to GDP and GMP. To understand at the atomic level the high concentration-dependent and unique GTPase activity properties of the protein, we have have cristallized the protein in presence of GMP and AlF to obtain a state mimicking the intermediate state of the GDP hydrolysis.</p><p>On May 2002 we have collected a first complete data set on ID14-1 to a 2.95Å resolution on these GBP1 crystals. Based on this experience we have been able to collect a second higher resolution data collected on ID14-4 to 2.45Å on June 2002. The crystals belong to P212121 and the orthorhombic unit cell of the ID14-1 data set is a=149.043 Å,b=101.164 Å,c=54.881 Å. Statistics on this 2.95Å data set gave an overall Rmeas=7% (I/σI=25.7) for a resolution range from 30 to 2.95 Å and an Rmeas=30.6% (I/σI=8.8) in</p><p>Data collection resolution limits (Å) 30 -1.90 space group I422 unit cell parameters a = b (Å) 73.73 c (Å) 125.15 a = ß = ?

We have obtained a molecular solution replacement solution with as search model the GMPPnhP-bound GBP1 structure <ref type="bibr">(Prakash et al., (2000)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">EMBO 19,</ref>. Model building and refinment are currently in process with a current Rfree at 37% and Rfactor at 34%. Current electron density maps suggest that GMP and AlF are bound to the protein in the crystal structure and that several regions of GBP1 undergo conformational changes in addition to the usual conformational changes found in switch 1 and switch 2 common to all regulatory GTP-binding proteins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sonia Fieulaine, Sylvie Nessler (1 shift) : Structural study of the Lactobacillus casei HPr Kinase / Phosphorylase FBP complex</head><p>HPr Kinase/Phosphorylase (HprK/P)</p><p>In year 2000, a first native data set had been collected on ID14-1 of 24/02/00 to 2.8Å resolution with crystals of the catalytic domain of L. casei HprK/P. A MAD data set collected on ID14-4 of 22/09/00 using the selenomethionine modified form of the protein allowed us to solve the first structure of HprK/P. Latter on, a data set collected on ID14-1 of 07/04/02 allowed us to solve by molecular replacement the structure of the complex between the catalytic domain of L. casei HprK/P and B. subtilis HPr.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fieulaine et al. (2002) PNAS, (accepted) PDB ID code: 1kkm</head><p>The 11/02/02 on ID14-1, we tested crystals of complexes between a full-length S. salivarius HprK/P in complex with B. subtilis HPr.</p><p>During this run we collected a low resolution data set with a new kind of crystals obtained with full length S. salivarius HprK/P in complex with HPr. We try to find a molecular replacement solution at 7Å resolution in the hope to see if HPr binding induces a large conformation change in the global structure of HprK/P, in particular in the position of the N-terminal regulatory domains.</p><p>We also tested the diffraction of small crystals obtained with the full length Neisseria HprK/P in presence of GDP but here again, we were not able to see spots above 8Å resolution. We now try to increase the dimensions of these crystals. 1) COMPLEX VPREB receptor, Spacegroup P21 ; a=48.7 b=71.2 c=65.9 ; β= 100° Resolution = 3.0 A completion = 89.9 % R-fact_total = 0.104 VpreB is a receptor protein which is expressed on the surface of developing B-cells at the preB stage. There has been a longstanding effort in the purufucation and crystallization of this atypical receptor. Crystals of the V preB receptor were obtained in presence of a Fab fragment directed against the receptor in order to help the crystallization process. Analysis of the solvent content of the crystals showed that the whole complex could not be present in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by Molecular Replacement showing that indeed only the Fab fragment crystallized. This structure will be useful since the same strategy of cocrystallization with the Fab, is now being used in other combinations : VpreB and effector ligands. Better crystals of the Fab are being prepared to allow more accurate refinement of the Fab structure.</p></div>

They are secreted in the culture medium as a complex with the immunity protein, which protects the producing organism against toxic effects. Colicin D has a tRNA hydrolysing toxic activity. It was shown that ColD is proteolytically cleaved during entrance in the target cell. ColD has no sequence identity with colicins of known structure. We obtained crystals of the complex of the E. Coli ColD and its corresponding immunity protein. Native data have been collected at 2.6A and improvement of the crystals has now yielded data at 2.0A resolution ( collected on the French CRG BM30). Biochemical analysis of the crystals revealed that they contain a proteolytic fragment of ColD that is generated during the crystallization process. Mass spectrometric analysis has been carried out to determine the exact sequence of the fragment. Se-Met production of these fragments is on the way to solve the structure of the fragment.</p></div>

Crystals suffer from severe anisotropy but useful data could be collected on native crystals during this run. Unfortunately , anisotropy gets beyond acceptable levels for the Se-Met substituted crystals. Efforts are being oriented towards improvements of the quality of the Se-Met crystals.</p></div>			</div>
