<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Objectives of the study Metastable β titanium alloys contain a sufficient amount of β-stabilizing elements to retain the high-temperature body-centered cubic phase in a metastable state after quenching to room temperature. In other words, the martensitic transformation β → α is suppressed upon cooling. Furthermore, these titanium alloys exhibit formation of an additional metastable phaseω phase. ω phase occurs as small particles (a few tens of nanometers in diameter) of either ellipsoidal or cuboidal shape, which are homogeneously dispersed throughout the β matrix. The presence of ω particles in the material has a significant impact on the mechanical properties as well as on further phase transformations occurring in the material during subsequent ageing. The objective of this study was to examine the evolution of the ω particles in the β matrix by the means of small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) during in-situ ageing. For the purpose of this research, two metastable β titanium alloys were selected -Ti -15 Mo and Ti -6.8 Mo -4.5 Fe -1.5 Al (LCB). The evolution of the ω particles was studied during isothermal runs carried out at temperatures in the range of 335 • C -450 • C. The analysis of the results allowed us to determine the evolution of sizes and distances of ω particles in dependence on temperature and time of the ageing. Moreover, activation energies of ω particles growth were evaluated from Arrhenius plot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>All measured samples were single crystals with the 001 direction (of the bodycentered cubic β phase) oriented parallel to the beam direction. Obtained 2D SAXS patterns exhibited four side maxima centered around the beamstop. An independent Laue diffraction analysis showed that the side maxima are positioned along [100] β directions (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The profiles of the side maxima were fitted using a short-range order model (SRO). In order to simplify the fitting procedure, only radial cuts through two of the side maxima were evaluated and therefore, one dimensional SRO model could be used. Fitting of the 1D SRO model yielded average sizes of the ω particles (R), mean inter-particle distances (L) and their root mean square deviations (σ R and σ L , respectively). Mean radii of the ω particles calculated from individual isothermal runs are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for LCB titanium alloy and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for Ti -15 Mo.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
