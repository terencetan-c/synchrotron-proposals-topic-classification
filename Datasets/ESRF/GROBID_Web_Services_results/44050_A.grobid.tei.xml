<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The general goal of the experiment was to identify the crystallographic polymorphs present in La-doped ZrO 2 and Er-doped HfO 2 polycrystalline thin films (5-30 nm thick) grown on Si(001) and Ge (001) substrates and annealed at different temperatures up to 900°C. The goal was reached. However a systematic and comprehensive study of a full set of samples could not be satisfied for all materials, due to lack of time; in particular few Er-doped HfO 2 films were only quickly measured, as a feasibility test measurements. We ran out-of-time, mainly for two reasons: (i) finding of proper measurement strategy; (ii) longer time (than expected) for scan acquisitions. In a first attempt, the grazing incidence geometry was adopted, keeping beam energy at 8 keV, to maintain consistency with laboratory data and exploring the angular region where overlapped peaks from different phases in laboratory data existed, with the aim to separate each contribution. This approach failed because of the reduced dimensions of the diffracted domains, which is reflected in a peak-line intrinsically too broad for the discrimination of the separate contributions from the tetragonal and the cubic phases. A new strategy was then pursued. Taking advantage of the high signal to noice ratio that was attaineable by working at E=13 keV, we concentrated our efforts on the identification of a single, intrinsically of low intensity, but well isolated, diffraction peak belonging to the tetragonal component, the t(102) peak, as indicated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> for HfO 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1: Powder diffration patterns as reported in ICSD database for cubic (orange), monoclinic (red) and tetragonal (blue) HfO 2 phases. The arrow indicates the position of the t(102) reflection.</head><p>This approach was very successful on ZrO 2 and La-ZrO 2 samples grown on Si, which could be systematically measured and critically analyzed. It was found that the crystallographic phase of pure ZrO 2 films is highly influenced by the oxidizing agent used during the deposition process. While the use of H 2 O gives films consisting of monoclinic, tetragonal and cubic polymorphs, the monoclinic phase is not detected in the as-deposited O 3 -based films (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The clear detection of the tetragonal t(102) reflection, allowed the identification of the ZrO 2 tetragonal phase and to follow its evolution as a function of film thickness and post deposition annealing. Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> show that the tetragonal phase reduces, becoming hardly detectable, at increasing film thickness and with the annealing, at the expense of the concomitant development of the monoclinic phase. The measured dielectric constant values, κ ~ 24 or κ ~ 30 for the films deposited using H 2 O or O 3 , could be correlated with the differences in the ZrO 2 observed phases, in particular the increase of the monoclinic phase reducing the κ value. These results are accepted for presentation at the XTOP 2010 conference.</p><p>Considering films grown on Ge, at 13keV, the contributions from both the Ge (311) asymmetric reflection and the fluorescence from the excitation of the K α transition sensibly increased the background, reducing the signal to noise ratio. La-ZrO 2 films on Ge were then evaluated at E=9 keV. At this beam energy, within the same scan, we could detect the presence of ZrO 2 tetragonal phase and evaluate the development of ZrO 2 monoclinic phase considering the m(-121) and m(112) reflections, which are located and well resolved around the t( <ref type="formula">102</ref>) peak. This study is particularly relevant, as the development of the tetragonal phase, without any monoclinic contribution, was believed to be the origin of the high-κ value measured on La-ZrO 2 films grown on Ge and annealed at 400 °C <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. These measurements (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) are the first direct experimental evidence that very thin La-ZrO 2 films, grown on Ge, develop the tetragonal phase after annealing.

Finally, preliminary data (at E=9keV) on Er-doped HfO 2 (Er&lt;10% at) films grown on Si showed the presence of the tetragonal phase and an unwanted monoclinic phase development after annealing at 900°C. We aim to systematically investigate the crystalline phase changes in Er-HfO 2 films grown on both Si(001) and Ge (001) substrates, as a function of Er content, in the submitted continuation proposal (Ref. N. 25590). 0.32 0.36 0.48 0.50 m t/c m m H 2 O 1/d (A -1 ) O 3 t(102) Fig. 2: ZrO 2 films on Si: structural differences (i.e. monoclinic phase) is evident in films grown using different oxiding agent.
