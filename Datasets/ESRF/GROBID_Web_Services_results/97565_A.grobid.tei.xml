<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>During our work at the beamline ID15b from 25.01.2022 to 27.01.2022 we have conducted the following high-pressure synchrotron diffraction experiments:</p><p>-Two single crystals of BaAs 2 Zn 2 O 8 *H 2 O has been studied upon compression and decompression in the pressure range 0-13 GPa with the pressure step about 2-5 GPa (8 pressure points) -One single crystal of HfB 2 O 5 has been studied in the pressure range 0-155 GPa with the pressure step 5-20 GPa (16 pressure points) -One single crystal of dmisteinbergite CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 has been studied up to 21 GPa with the pressure step 2-5 GPa (8 pressure points) -Sample preparations, preparation of diamond anvil cells (DACs) and DAC loadings for all samples were performed in the ESRF.</p><p>As a result, diffraction data were obtained. The first investigations demonstrated, that:</p><p>-The crystal structure of BaAs 2 Zn 2 O 8 *H 2 O amorphized at the pressure above 10 GPa and this transformation is not reversible.</p><p>-The crystal structure of HfB 2 O 5 is stable in the whole pressure range. The experiment was stopped due to the impossibility to further increase the pressure. We plan to continue this experiment.</p><p>-Dmisteinbergite amorhpizes at the pressure about 18 GPa. Probably it undergoes phase transition below this pressure, but the obtained data need more careful refinements.</p><p>The aim of the experiments has been achieved: three samples were studied in the quite wide pressure ranges.</p><p>All data collected during the beamtime are sufficient for publications. It would be interesting to study HfB 2 O 5 at the pressure higher pressures.</p></div>		</body>
