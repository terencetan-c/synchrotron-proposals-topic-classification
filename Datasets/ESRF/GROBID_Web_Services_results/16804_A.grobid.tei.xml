<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The prime activity was concerned with in situ montoring of the formation and reactivity of a heterogeneous catalyst, Rh/Al 2 O 3 prepared from the reduction of RhCl 3 on alumina by hydrogen. A quartz capillary microreactor was employed with a mass spectrometer to allow simultaneous monitoring of the gas phase composition and the structure of the metal centres by energy dispersive EXAFS. On introduction to the reactor, the pre-reduced sample showed clear evidence of oxidation. Under mild conditions, treatment with H 2 /He generates metallic rhodium, with the particle size increasing with temperature (From CN Rh-Rh = ~4 at room temperature to ~8 at 300 o C after ~ 15 minutes exposure to H 2 /He). These particles rapidly reoxidised on exposure to O 2 /He at 100 o C. From a structure showing a Rh-Rh coodination number of ~6.5, the new structure showed the following structural features: 2.7(3) Rh-O at 2.07Å; 2.6(3) Rh-Rh at 2.72Å within 15 minutes. This oxidation appears to follow two stages, with the first one occurring within 10 seconds.</p><p>Metal fragmentation on exposure to NO was even more rapid, with the disruption occurring within 5 seconds to afford a similar oxidised Rh centre, albeit with an additional Rh-N shell (1.78Å) attributable to a nitrosyl ligand, which is observed by IR spectroscopy. Accompanied with this exothermic reaction is the evolution of N 2 and N 2 O, which can only emanate from dissociative chemisorption of the NO. The temperature rise of the bed can be correlated with the known adsorption energy of NO on Rh single crystals. With the small metal particles present in these catalysts, this chemisorption is considered to form very rapid local heating of the metal particles, which fragment oxidatively under these conditions. These rapid changes in metal structure have some consequences for the understanding of oxide supported metal catalysts.</p><p>Secondly, further work on the reaction of RhCl(CO) 2 /Al 2 O 3 was carried out resulting in a publication, the abstract of which is presented below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simultaneous Determination of Structural and Kinetic Parameters Characterizing the Interconversion of Highly Dispersed Species: the interaction of NO with Rh</head><formula xml:id="formula_0">I (CO) 2 /γ-Al 2 O 3 .</formula><p>Newton, M.A., Burnaby, D.G., Dent, A.J., Diaz-Moreno, S., Evans, J., Fiddy, S.G., Neisius, T., Pascarelli, S., and Turin, S. J Phys <ref type="bibr">Chem A, 2001, 105, 5965 -5970.</ref> Energy-dispersive EXAFS (EDE), combined with mass spectrometry and a flow niicroreactor system, has been used to investigate the reaction of an A1 2 O 3supported Rh I (CO) 2 species with NO. This combined in situ approach uniquely permits a priori analysis of the structures of the species involved (on a time scale of Ca. 2 s) and simultaneous determination of reaction mechanism and kinetic parameters. In the current case, it is found that the Al(O)Rh I (CO) 2 C1 species reacts to form an intermediate Al(O)Rh(NO) 2 Cl Cl species (v ~ 0.357 ± 0.125 s -1 , E act ~ 11 ± 1.25 kJ mol -1 ), which subsequently forms an (AlO) 2 Rh(NO)C1 species and N 2 O (g) (v ~ 2 ± 0.5 x 10 4 s -1 , E act ~ 40 ± 3.5 kJ mol -1 ) showing a bent (134 o ) RhNO bond. This combination of rapid and complementary techniques should be applicable to a wide range of disciplines where quantitative structural and kinetic determinations are of importance.</p></div>		</body>
