<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to comissioon a mobile laser heating system, developed by the Bayerisches Geoinstitut Bayreuth (BGI) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, and currently in use at ID09A and ID18, for usage at the inelastic x-ray scattering beamline ID20. The goal was to enable resonant-and non-resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy ((R)XES) and non-resonant X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) spectroscopy of materials at pressure and temperature conditions prevailing in the Earth's mantle and core. We were especially interested in determining the system's capabilities and limitations for the investigation of the electronic structure of materials under extreme conditions using the inelastic X-ray scattering techniques available at ID20.</p><p>At current, X-ray spectroscopic measurements at combined high pressure and high temperature in a Laser Heated Diamond Anvil Cell (LHDAC) are challenging and can only be carried out at very few synchrotron beam-lines across the world. Therefore, only few electronic structure studies in extreme-pressure mineralogy exist that follow the expected mantle geotherm. However, we need to elucidate the effect of simultaneous temperature and pressure when investigating questions related to the Earth's mantle and core. As one explorative question, we turned to the temperature dependence of the iron transition from a high to a low electron spin configuration in lower mantle minerals under compression, which has received considerable attention in the last few years <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. This spin-transition of iron causes a drastic change in the elastic properties of minerals <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, making this process a question of primary importance for geophysics <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In a first experimental session, we used the high resolution spectrometer situated in experimental hutch EH2 of ID20 to study the Fe K-beta emission line of FeCO3 under simultaneous high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. A specially developed setup enabled us to laser heat along the compression axis in the horizontal direction while measuring the emitted X-ray photons in a "through-the-gasket" geometry perpendicular to the compression axis, i.e. in the vertical direction. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> a) shows the experimental setup as used on the high-resolution spectrometer in EH2 of ID20. Selected results of measurements at ambient temperatures and at 2000K are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1 b</ref>). The presented spectra demonstrate the feasibility of our setup, but also demonstrate the weaknesses: the utilized high pressure Be gasket contained traces of Fe metal which resulted in spurious metallic Fe signal that could not be separated completely from the Fe K-beta line of the FeCO3 sample.</p><p>In a consecutive experimental session, we attempted to use the portable laser heating system at the large solid angle spectrometer for non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering in EH3 of ID20. The utilized setup was the same as used for the XES experiments in EH2: laser heating parallel to the compression axis, whereas the inelastic X-ray scattering took place in the vertical scattering plane. Thus we could exploit all vertical detector modules or 36 analyzer crystals.</p><p>These XRS measurements were intended to allow studying the spin-transition in FeCO3 at the Fe M23 edge, i.e. as a complementary probe to the performed XES measurements. Although successfully reaching high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, the obtained Fe M23-edge spectra defy definite conclusions and several experimental difficulties have to be circumvented for future attempts. To avoid temperature gradients, the sample was chosen to be of smaller extend than both, the laser and X-ray beam size, i.e. of the order of 10 microns. This leads to considerable background noise in the overall scattering signal.</p><p>In conclusions, we have tested and used the portable laser heating system of ID18 to be used at ID20. Resonant and non-resonant emission spectroscopy experiments are well within reach of the current experimental setup. However, care has to be taken for the choice of pressure medium and gasket material. Therefore, we suggest to next explore the emission lines of Co, Ni, Mn. Non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering remains challanging at present, but we see considerable potential in conjunction with the expected smaller X-ray beam size after the ESRF EBS upgrade program.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Experiment title: Commissioning of a Mobile Laser Heating System at ID20 for Resonant X-ray Emission Spectroscopy and Xray Raman Scattering at Extreme Conditions</figDesc></figure>
