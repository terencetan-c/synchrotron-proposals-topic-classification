<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments have been performed along the lines of our proposal, focussing on in situ and real time growth studies of PDI8-CN2 molecule. Since the experiments were performed only two weeks ago and the data analysis is still in progress, we can only report the most important findings.</p><p>In situ and real time X-ray scattering provided information on the structure evolution as well as the growth mode of PDI8-CN2 films on Si substrates. The previous experiment (MA-964) showed that the deposition parameters, such as substrate temperature, T sub , and deposition flux, are crucial in determining the film growth mode and the structure/morphology of the resulting film. For this reason in this experiment we have decided to fix the deposition flux (1Ǻ/min) and to perform the in-situ XRR measurements at different T sub (30°C, 60°C and 100°C). XRR curves have been recorded by means of a linear PSD during the PDI8-CN2 deposition and the acquisition time of ~ 2 min per reflectivity scan was chosen to enable the study of the relatively slow growth process. In this way, XRR as a function of time as well as of q during PDI8-CN2 growth has been collected. XRR data in a q-range, exceeding the Bragg point, have been measured in real time during PDI8-CN2 deposition. From each deposition, the AntiBragg (AB) oscillation vs deposition time (or film thickness) can be extracted. As an example, the AB curve for PDI8-CN2 deposited at T sub =30°C is reported in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The proper analysis of this data set will allows us to determine the film growth mode and its dependence on the deposition parameters.</p><p>After each deposition a XRR scan (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) together with a XRD specular scan and Grazing Incidence In-plane measurements (not shown here) here have been recorded in order to have a complete characterisation of the deposited film.</p><p>We wish to acknowledge the excellent collaboration with the local contacts Dr. Roberto Nervo and Dr. Federico Zontone which made this challenging experiment a success.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: For PDI8-CN2 deposited at T sub =30°C (a) AB oscillation vs deposition time extracted from the real time reflectivity curve; (b) post-growth XRR experimental and calculated curves.</figDesc></figure>
