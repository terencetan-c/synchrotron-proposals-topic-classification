<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>In the context of energy saving one important challenge of solid state inorganic chemistry is the development of future materials for light emitting diodes (LEDs). For this purpose new phosphors have to be found in order to produce white light of high color quality by combination of blue, red, and green radiation. Eu(II) doped compounds are very interesting because of their extremely high luminescence efficiency, which leads to very bright luminescent materials. Coordiation numbers and europium ligand distances are very important factors, which influence the crystal field splitting of the Eu(II) 5d-excited states and therefore the emission energy of europium ions. This structure property relationship which can be investigated with EXAFS and luminescence spectroscopy is, however, necessary in order to design novel phosphors.</p><p>Another goal of our studies is to determine the crystallographic position of Eu(II) in host lattices where two or more sites could be subsituted. In our previous work we found red and green luminescent materials, especially when Eu 2+ ions are expected to substitute Mg 2+ , which are very promising materials for applications in LEDs. Because of the large differences of the ionic radii of both ions, the substitution site was, however, not proved. Therefore, we investigated the coumpounds AMgCl 3 (A= Cs, Rb, K), where Eu 2+ can enter either the alkaline metal or the magnesium site. Because of the completely different coordination spheres of both sites, this point can be very well investigated by EXAFS measurements.</p><p>For the EXAFS investigations powder samples were prepared by melting the binary chlorides in stochiometric ratios. Doping was achived by adding 3 mol% of EuCl 2 . All steps were performed under inert gas conditions to avoid the oxidation of divalent europium. The presence of trivalent europium would disturb the oscillation in the EXAFS range and prevent the determination of the coordination numbers and bondlengths. In fact, no traces of Europium(III) could be detected. The EXAFS measurements were done at the L 3 -edge of Europium in fluorescence mode at room temperature.</p><p>The following Eu 2+ doped compounds were investigated: KMgCl 3 , RbMgCl 3 , CsMgCl 3 , KCaCl 3 , RbCaCl 3 , CsCaCl 3 and CsCdCl 3 . Fitting of the first coordination shell was successful for almost every host lattice and preliminary results could be obtained for the average Eu-Cl distances. Two examples are shown in figures 1 and 2. The EXAFS measurements revealed, that the theory describing the strong correlation between luminescence, bondlengths and coordination number cannot be applied to every system. The successful measurements on CsACl 3 :Eu 2+ (A = Mg, Cd, Ca) which led to precise structural characterisation of bondlengths, coordination numbers and europium sites, encouraged us now to work on more complicated systems like KMgCl 3 :Eu 2+ and RbMgCl 3 :Eu 2+ where two sites seem to be occupied by europium. Investigations on further host lattices are mandatory in order to determine the influence of the second and third coordination spheres on the luminescence properties.
