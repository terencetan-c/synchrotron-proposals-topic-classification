<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The overall focus of the project is deciphering reaction mechanisms of selected cofactor proteins. These systems are very labile for radiation damage of the redox sites during diffraction data collection, which makes in situ studies using single-crystal UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy inevitable to both prove and trap different redox states and to monitor the potential radiation damage.</p><p>We have previously taken part in developing an in situ spectroscopy setup at BM01. After the refubishing and update of the ESRF, we had to update and adjust this setup. In the previous beamtime we focused on reestablishing the UV-vis in situ single-crystal setup in combination with X-ray diffraction at BM01, and in this beamtime to re-establish the whole in situ spectroscopy setup with both UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy. The updated setup is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Both UV-vis and Raman light is aligned to hit a crystal centered in the X-ray beam. The crystal is manually mounted and centered and orientation optimised for best UV-vis and Raman spectra, while the data colletion can be script based and performed from the control cabin. There the running of both X-ray, Raman and UV-vis can be executed as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>.</p><p>The re-established setup was used to investigate different effects on both haem-, flavo-and copper proteins. The setup worked well, and the data are still processed, therefore two examples of data collected is shown below. For myoglobin compound II H2O2 and D2O2 generated crystals were compared with both single-crystal UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). It has been debated if the iron-oxo compoud II state is protonated or not.The initial results show similar UV-vis spectra, while there are difference in the Raman spectra compared to previously colleted Raman spectra on H2O2 generated compound II. These data will be futher analysed. For NrdI protons are involved in the redox reaction, thefore the effect of NrdI in H2O and D2O was compared, and the changes induced by X-ray data collection. Raman data was collected at different timepoints during the X-ray data collection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). Some changes was observed and the data will be further processed and analysed. For the copper proteins the Raman spectra was successfully obtained by the use of 532 nm laser.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 -a) Re-established UV-vis and Raman in situ setup at BM01, b) zoomed in.</figDesc><graphic coords="1,94.10,538.05,316.51,206.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>
