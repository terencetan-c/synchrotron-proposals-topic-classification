<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>./Testicular receptor 4</head><p>The nuclear receptor TR4 is an orphan receptor that has no known ligand. It has been crystallized in order to aid ligand identification. We previously collected low and high resolution datasets but these data could not be merged properly. Here, a complete 40.0-3.0 Å dataset has been collected (I4122 form). The structure has been solved by molecular replacement and is currently being refined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>./Pregnane X receptor</head><p>The nuclear receptor PXR is a xenosensor involved in the detoxification of the organism. We have identified a new PXR ligand (PXR-4) that has better functional characteristics than the reference ligand. We co-crystallized PXR-4 with PXR and collected a 2.3 Å dataset. The structure has been solved by molecular replacement and is currently being refined (current Rw = 0.20, Rf = 0.27).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>./Cyclophilin D</head><p>The Cyp D has been crystallized alone (apo-form) and in complex with a new inhibitor. Datasets at 1.0 Å resolution have been collected for both apo and liganded CypD. The structures have been solved by molecular replacement and are currently being refined (current Rw = 0.27/0.28, Rf = 0.29/0.31).</p><p>This document was created with Win2PDF available at <ref type="url" target="http://www.win2pdf.com">http://www.win2pdf.com</ref>.
