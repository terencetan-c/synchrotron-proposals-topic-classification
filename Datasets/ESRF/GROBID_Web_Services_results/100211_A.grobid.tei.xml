To this end, monazite powders with different levels of Ca/Ce-co-substitution produced via a coprecipitation procedure were investigated in the temperature range 300-1250 K. Prior to the measurements at ESRF, elemental mappings of the material were performed using electron probe micro-analysis. These measurements showed two distinct phases in powders subjected to temperatures as high as 1500 K while samples that were not subjected to temperatures higher than 1050 K showed no clear segregation. The phases visible in the high-temperature samples were identified as La1-xCexPO4 with a monazite structure and a calcium phosphate phase with an unknown structure. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the elemental mapping of a grain boundary is shown with a monazite grain in the lower right corner and the surrounding calcium phosphate phase. To shed light on the desegregation process as well as its starting temperature experiments were performed at BM20 at the ESRF. Initially, three standard samples were measured to calibrate the newly acquired Anton Paar heating chamber used in this experiment. The standard samples were α-Al2O3, ZrW2O8 und SiO2. O repeated measurements were taken on all samples, following the procedures:</p><p>α-Al2O3: 1000 K to room temperature -ZrW2O8: room temperature to 750 K to room temperature -SiO2: room temperature to 1000 K to room temperature</p><p>The calibration of the chamber was successful and was shared with the beamline staff for future applications and users.</p><p>From the monazite powder data, the identification of the calcium phosphate phase was not possible. From Rietveld refinement of the monazite-type phases, the changes in unit cell volume were determined for different compositions as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. While LaPO4 and La0.8(Ca,Ce)0.2PO4 display the expected (almost) linear dependency, marked deviations were observed for samples with higher degrees of substitution. The sample containing 50 % Lanthanum exhibits a sudden decrease in unit cell volume at 800 K while the highly doped samples deviate from a linear behaviour starting at 800 K. This indicates that the desegregation coupled with a reduction of cerium sets in at 800 K. In-situ XANES studies on the corresponding phases are planned to test this hypothesis. </p></div>			</div>
