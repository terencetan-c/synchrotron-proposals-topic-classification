<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measured samples:</head><p>-Mn foil (transmission) -[MnN x(1.5 nm) /Si 3 N 4(3nm) ] 10 samples with P N2 /P total ratio of: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% (20 bilayers) and also Mn/Si 3 N 4 (1 Mn layer with 3nm of Si 3 N 4 on top, named as MnSN0)</p><p>The normalized sample spectra are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. First analysis shows that, except for MnSN0 sample, with mostly metallic Mn, just slight differences appear in the XAS spectra of [MnN x(1.5 nm) /Si 3 N 4(3nm) ] 10 samples prepared with different P N2 /P total ratio.</p><p>The XANES region of [MnN x(1.5 nm) /Si 3 N 4(3nm) ] 10 sample prepared with 0% of N 2 (black line) presents some differences respect to the others, as enhanced white line intensity, increased XAS features amplitude and different evolution of the pre-peak intensity in comparison with the other samples from the series, as it can be observed in Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1(a)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the slight differences, a direct relation seems to appear between the optical and electrical properties of the samples series and their XAS spectra. Clear differences can be observed in the pre-peak intensity. Samples prepared with 25 % and 50 % of P N2 /P total show reduced and nearly identical pre-peak amplitude, in agreement with their enhanced and similar resistivity values. By contrast, the samples prepared with 75 % and 50 % of P N2 /P total show an increased pre-peak intensity, what can be related to their smaller electric resistivity, decreasing the electrical resistivity as the pre-peak intensity increases.</p><p>Sample prepared with 0% of N 2 , on the other hand, exhibits different XAS features. However, its pre-peak intensity follows the same evolution as the electric resistivity, laying between samples with 75 % and 50 %. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
