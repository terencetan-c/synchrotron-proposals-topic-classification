The work is part of a collaborative project investigating semiconductor donor-acceptor block copolymers for use in organic photovoltaics. These block copolymers show complex hierarchical structures consisting of a nanometre-scale phase separated structure with both phases displaing order on a molecular scale. It is generally accepted for organic semiconductors that the morphology has a strong influence on optelectronic properties and solar cell device performance.</p><p>In our experiment we intended to use a combination of GISAXS and GID to observe structures on different length scales. The samples were characterized beforehand by preliminary measurements in our home laboratory using in plane x-ray diffraction and AFM. In order to understand the complex structures arising in the copoplymers, we investigated the individual components first in order to use the resulting insight for understanding the more complex material. For that purpose the Bayreuth group synthesized in addition to the block copolymer homopolymers corresponding to the two blocks and low molecular weight model materials which resemble the chemical structures contained in the perylene side chain polymer. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> introduces the investigated materials. While in the previous experiment we investigated structure formation in the bulk, SC3180 was our first experiment on thin films of the materials described above. The aim of this first experiment was a) to establish the use of thin film x-ray scattering methods for the samples under study b) to compare structures obtained directly by spin coating with the structure formed after cooling from the melt state. The fast drying process resulting from spin coating typically leads to a non-equilibrium structure which is generally quite different from the thermodynamic equilibrium structure. The following samples were investigated: 1. P3HT homopolymer 2. PPerAcr homopolymer 3. Low molecular weight perylene bisimide model compound 4. P3HT-b-PPErAcr block copolymer For all samples diffraction patterns were collected in grazing incidence geometry by performing scans with the 1D detector covering the parts of reciprocal space with the most prominent Bragg reflections. Exemplary data sets are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. Due to the short time available since the experiment, a full analyis of the data still has to be performed, and we can only give preliminary results at this point. As a general result, directly after spincoating most samples were highly disordered showing no Bragg reflections. Somewhat an exception is P3HT, which showed weak reflections even directly after spin coating (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Samples heated to the melt state crystallized during subsequent cooling and showed strong crystalline peaks (Bragg reflections) and a strong texture. As the example of P3HT shows, the (h00) planes are oriented parallel to the substrate, in this case a known result. Similar orientation phenomena were also observed in the perylene containing side chain polymer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). For the PPerAcr the crystal structure in the thin film seems modified in comparison to the bulk structure. The measurements of the block copolymer inidicated a different orientation in the blocks than in the two individual homopolymers. All data sets will be analized in order to determine the crystal structure in the thin films and to work out the orientation. One aim of our work is to understand the underlying alignment process, as ideally for solar cell applications one would like to control the orientation. In a last part of the experiment we started to investigate the influence of different substrates on the orientaton of the polymers. As a first example we studied P3HT-b-PPerAcr on silicon and on PEDOT:PSS which is often used as a substrate in solar cells.</p><p>While the GID measurements worked out very well, we were not able to observe a GISAXS signal from our samples, although we know that the block copolymers show a SAXS signal in transmission and that a lateral microphase structure is visible in AFM measurements. We therefore assume that the signal from the sample was hidden below a relatively high background signal caused by slit scattering. This point has to be addressed in a next run, where we will use an additional guard slit to reduce background. The higher resolution of the upgraded beamline should also help to measure the relevant signal. For the GID measurements we would like to use mostly a 2D detector in future, in order to reduce the long exposure times necessary for scans covering a larger angular range.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: a) Schematic representation of the donor acceptor block copolymers with blocks of poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT and poly(perylene bisimide acrylate) PPerAcr. b) chemical structure of P3HT-bl-PPerAcr. c) crystalline structure of P3HT (lamellae), d) liquid crystalline structure of PPerAcr.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,33.95,36.85,517.45,118.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
