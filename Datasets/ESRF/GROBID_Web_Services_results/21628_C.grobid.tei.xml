<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiments reported here (SC-885, 4 th allocation period) are related to experiments selected to exploit the performances of RAPID detector developed by Daresbury detector group, temporarily installed at ID2 to test the characteristics of the most advanced gas filled detector for time resolved SAXS measurements with the beam of a 3 rd generation synchrotron. We pursued the task repeating an experiment just started with the FReLoN CCD detector during SC-885 3 rd allocation period, namely the study of the structural dynamics of the filaments and the fraction of force generating heads during the transition from resting to active tetanic contraction (T0). The effect of the activation was isolated from that of increase in force by comparing the data from isometric tetani with those from tetani where the initial rise of force was prevented by imposing shortenings at the unloaded shortening velocity (V0) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Due to the limited spatial resolution of RAPID with respect to FreLoN (PSF ∼400 µm FWHM with respect to 220 µm), only the intensity and spacing of the reflections are compared here, by choosing a specimen-detector distance of ca 3.5m (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). With the CCD detector and the unattenuated flux obtained with the second undulator (6*10 13 ph/s/100mA), the M3 and M6 reflections could be recorded with 5 ms resolution during the development of the tetanus. One 5 ms frame was collected per tetanus, and 24 tetani were necessary to describe the 120 ms of tetanus development. There was no sign of radiation damage up to the end of the experiment, as the fibre was shifted along after each tetanus. The 1 st actin layer line could be resolved by adding data from two fibres (10-20 ms total exposure). With the RAPID detector (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) a whole sequence of 30 frames of 4.8 ms was collected during the first 144 ms of the tetanus development and the sequence could be repeated in successive tetani. The radiation damage could be reduced by shifting the fibre after each tetanus (144 ms exposure). Unfortunately, the efficiency of RAPID detector was severely reduced by the different beam energy at ID2 (12 KeV) with respect to that at beamline 16.1 at Daresbury (7.5 KeV), and this, in conjunction with the small diffracting mass of our single fibre preparation, compromised the quality of the results. However we could use the maximum flux available through the by-pass camera (3*10 13 ph/s/100mA with the second undulator) without reaching the count rate saturation. For each protocol data from 8 fibres for a total of ca 70 ms per frame were sufficient to resolve the M3 and M6, but not the 1 st actin layer line. The data show that the ca 1.6% increase in spacing of both M3 and M6 from resting to T0 is delayed in parallel with force when the initial rise of tetanic force is prevented by shortening at V0. The spacing of M3, but not that of M6, reduces by 0.2% during the time the force is kept to zero by the shortening ramp. These results give a direct evidence that there are large scale changes in the thick filament structure related to both activation and force. Methods: Single intact fibres dissected from the tibialis anterior muscle of Rana temporaria were mounted in a trough containing Ringer solution at 4 °C and at ∼2.2 µm sarcomere length between a force transducer and a loudspeaker coil motor as already described <ref type="bibr">(Piazzesi et al., J. Physiol. 514:305, 1999)</ref>. Patterns were collected on the RAPID gas-filled detector placed at 3.5 m (to collect the intensities of the higher order meridional reflections, up to M6, and of the actin layer lines). Data analysis was performed using SAXS Macros (P. Boesecke, ESRF) and Peakfit software (SPSS Science). The radial integration limits were: ± 37 nm for the M3 and M6 reflections.
