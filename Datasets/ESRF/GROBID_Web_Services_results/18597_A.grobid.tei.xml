<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>About 10 samples of excised breast tissue was studied by SAXS. A small (0.2 x 0.2 mm 2 ) beam of 0.1 nm wavelength was used to probe the samples in small intervals. The SAXS pattern was recorded at each position using a fast-readout CCD camera. Typical data acquisition time per frame was 50 ms. The data were corrected for read-out noise, and by the attenuation factor. Sample thickness was about 1 mm, so that in some cases the beam traversed different tissue types. Histological examination of the samples was done after the experiments at HUCH. Different tissue types were identified, globular and ductal carcinomas, fibroadenoma, collagen-rich connective tissue, and adipose tissue (fat). The changes of the SAXS pattern were related to these tissue types by matching the histology map of the sample to the scanning grid. In collagen-rich regions the axial periodicity, diameter and orientation of the fibrils, and their hexagonal packing distance were determined. The exponent of the intensity decrease in the power law regime was determined, and it was found to be 1 to 1.5, corresponding to the rodlike shape of the fibrils. When an in-situ carcinoma was traversed, the collagen signal became weak or disappeared, and the average intensity increased by factor of 5 or more. The power-law exponent was about 2.5, which is typical for coil-like structures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The intensity scattered by normal adipose tissue is very low, indicating homogeneous structure with small density variations. However, in areas where cancer cells have invaded the adipose tissue the scattered intensity increases strongly, and a weak collagen signal is observed. The results demonstrate that the SAXS patterns are characteristic to tissue types. This opens avenues for studies in two directions: the use of the SAXS signatures of the tissues for imaging, and analysis of the structures of different tissues on the molecular and supramolecular level. The first avenue may lead to improved methods for detecting malignant tumors at early stages, and the second avenue may lead to better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms involved in cancer growth and invasion of normal tissue.</p></div>		</body>
