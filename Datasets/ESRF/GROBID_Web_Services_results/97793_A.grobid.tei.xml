Of Chemistry "Ugo Schiff" and CSGI, University of Florence Report:</p><p>Polymers from natural biomasses, and particularly lignin, have emerged as a green alternative with diverse applications, including large-scale delivery of bioactives for agricultural purposes. Lignin, a renewable biopolymer abundant in plant cell walls and represents a byproduct of paper industry, can be harnessed to create nanocapsules suitable for this goal. Lignin-based nanocapsules (NCs) offer a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to encapsulate bioactive compounds, particularly molecules endowed with antimicrobial properties such as capsaicin. We prepared lignin NCs at two different starting concentrations (1% and 5% w/w lignin), filled with either olive oil or neem oil, both known for their antioxidant properties, and we loaded them with capsaicin at three different concentrations (1, 3, 6 mg/mL). Two pH values were tested (11 and 13) and different sonication conditions to assess the impact of these parameters on the supramolecular structure and stability of the obtained empty and loaded NCs. We performed advanced structural characterization of the supramolecular arrangement by high-resolution techniques, such as synchrotron SAXS and USAXS, covering a wide q-range, i.e. 3x10 -4 Å -1 -0.7 Å -1 , which allowed to explore the different size populations in our samples. Particularly, two populations were evidenced from complementary techniques (DLS, SEM) in the range 50-100 nm and 500-600 nm. Data analysis showed that the pH influenced the overall size and stability of the samples, giving a bimodal distribution of sizes and a form factore typical of spherical objects for samples at higher pH; moreover, NCs showed to be quite flexible and to be able to encapsulate different amounts of capsaicin at high encapsulation efficiency without changing dramatically their overall structure. These data complemented by other techniques, allowed us to finely investigate such complex samples and, we believe, to meaningfully contribute on the study of natural-derived unconventional nanovectors for sustainable delivery in agriculture.</p></div>		</body>
