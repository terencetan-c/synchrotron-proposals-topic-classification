<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Current experiment HS-1618 continues a series devoted to the development of stroboscopic X-ray imaging of acoustic wave fronts propagating in single crystals. We were able to achieve two important goals formulated in the beginning of this project. The first goal is visualization of wave front distortions due to phonon scattering by dislocations, which have a crucial effect on thermal conductivity and related phenomena. Previously we showed, that stroboscopic X-ray topography synchronized with short surface acoustic waves (SAW) enables us to visualize individual acoustic wave fronts as well as their distortions when crossing the dislocation lines (Mat.Sci.&amp;Eng.A 309, <ref type="bibr">23 (2001)</ref>). Due to optimized contrast, the images taken during last beam session from piezoelectric LiNbO 3 crystals with inter-digital transducer on top of them, exhibited specific shapes of acoustic wave fronts in close vicinity to the dislocation line (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">2</ref>). These specific wave front distortions are caused by the dynamic deformation field, which is produced by vibrating dislocation segments. Basing on computer simulations and comparison between simulated and experimental images (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) we were able to extract the amplitudes of dislocation vibrations, which indicate the strength of phonon/dislocation interaction. These findings will be published shortly.</p><p>The second goal is an extension of the application range of this new technique to non-piezoelectric and weakly piezoelectric crystals, with no deposited electrodes on top of them. We demonstrate successful X-ray diffraction imaging of high-frequency (0.29 GHz) surface acoustic waves propagating within Si and GaAs crystals (see Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In order to generate surface acoustic waves in semiconductor crystals the latter were coupled to LiNbO 3 -based surface acoustic wave transducers via contact liquids. The maximum surface acoustic wave transmission is achieved for evanescent waves under optimized coupling conditions at liquid/sample interface. The developed technique opens a way to directly study phonon interaction with defects in non-piezoelectric and weakly piezoelectric crystals. A part of the obtained results is summarized in two papers, one published in <ref type="bibr">SRN, 15, No. 2, 21 (2002)</ref> and the second one submitted to APL. FIG 1. X-ray image (left panel) containing individual acoustic wave fronts of a 0.58 GHz SAW and their distortions when crossing the dislocation lines in LiNbO 3 . Right panel -X-ray image of the same dislocation lines without SAW. FIG 2. X-ray image (right panel) showing dynamic deformation field near the vibrating dislocation line, as compared with contrast simulations (left panel) based on the deformation field in the vicinity of the vibrating dislocation segment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Names and affiliations of applicants (* indicates experimentalists):Prof. Emil Zolotoyabko , Department of Materials Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.
