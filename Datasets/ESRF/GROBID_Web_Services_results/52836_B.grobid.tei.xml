<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MD782 -REPORT Improving brain tumors perfusion imaging techniques: combined high spatial and temporal resolution SRCT with MAXIPIX-CdTe detector</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Proposal Summary</head><p>We want to take advantage of new hard X-rays 2D detection technologies developed at the ESRF to achieve combined high spatial and temporal resolution quantitative brain perfusion imaging using Synchrotron Radiation Computed Tomograghy (SRCT). This project will use the Maxipix-CdTe detector 1 and the first bolus pass contrast agent follow-up technique. A systematic study on phantoms including contrast agent mixtures (Gadolinium and Iodine) will be performed. This step is mandatory to characterize the quantitative aspect of SRCT using the Maxipix-CdTe in perfusion conditions. The technique will then be validated with in vivo perfusion SRCT imaging on rat brain tumors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SAMPLE STAGE:</head><p>SSRT rotating chair rotation speed from 6 °/s to 180 °/s</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHANTOMS AND LIVING ANIMALS:</head><p>-Steady-state protocol: Plastic tubes filled with different concentrations of Iodine (Iomeron 350 ®): 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 17.5, 25 mg/L.</p><p>-Dynamic protocol: 1. Flowing water circuit 2. Programmable injector which empties a syringe filled with Iodine (Iomeron 350 ®) 3. Plastic tubes in front of the beam filled with water in which 15 mL of iodine are slowly added. When injection stops the iodine is washed out of the tube under study by the flowing water, until its concentration falls to 0.</p><p>-In vivo imaging: 4 Fisher rats (Charles River) were injected with 10 4 F98 cells in the right caudate nucleus 9 days before imaging. 0.5 ml of Gadovist 75 ® or Iomeron 400 ® (5 animals each) will be injected in the jugular vein with a remote controlled injector at 1.5 ml.s -1 and imaged each second with the Maxipix-CdTe and germanium detector over 3 min (first bolus pass protocols). Second, the same rats will be infused with the same amount of contrast agent but at 0.5 ml.s -1 and imaged each 10 s over 20 min (steady-state protocols) with both Maxipix-CdTe and Frelon detectors. Reconstruction by C. Nemoz N.B. One image is enough to obtain tomography slices over the full beam height with a 60 µm vertical resolution.</p><p>Besides a good image quality and the very low dose achieved, the tumor is not visible (iodine concentration into the tumor was measured with the Ge detector at 1.4 mg/ml, which is below the limit of detection for the Maxipix-CdTe).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>We have shown during MD782 that the Maxipix-CdTe detector is suitable for such studies, on both steady-state protocol and for dynamic contrast-enhanced brain perfusion imaging, with phantoms and in vivo (see following image). Tomography images have been taken over 2s, 3s, 6s, and 60s. The high efficiency of the detector as well as its background noise suppression enabled very low dose imaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LIMITATIONS:</head><p>Low concentrations of iodine couldn't be resolved, this should be overcome.</p><p>The readout capabilities of the Maxipix-Cdte are expected to be improved, allowing a complete tomography temporal resolution of 512 (1024) projections over 360 degrees in 3 (6) seconds. Images need to be repeated without interruption during a total time of 8 minutes to follow up the contrast agent concentration. This was not possible during MD782. Data storage capabilities will then be optimized to overcome this limitation. Synchronization between the tomographic stage and the detector also need to be improved, as well as image reconstruction techniques.</p></div>
