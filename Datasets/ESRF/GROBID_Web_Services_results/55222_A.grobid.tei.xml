<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Carbon-rich, silica-poor melts are suspected to be the most common type of melts in the asthenosphere. These melts, formed by very low degree (&lt; 1%) partial melting of the upper mantle, play a key role in the global geochemical cycles of our planet, notably by concentrating mantle volatiles. These carbonated melts are assumed to be very mobile, owning to their (expected) high wetting properties and low density. This presumed mobility however is at odd with seismic 1 and electrical conductivity 2 investigations hinting to the presence of partial melts accumulated over a laterally continuous region at the Lithosphere -Asthenosphere boundary (LAB). One hypothesis that might reconcile these observations is if carbonated melts are more viscous than currently though, impeding ascent despite their low density. It is this hypothesis we attempted to challenge during a 15 shift period at the ESRF ID27 beamline in December 2014 , by performing falling sphere experiments under relevant high pressure and temperature conditions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment details</head><p>In the falling sphere technique, the viscosity relies on the measurement of the settling velocity of a dense metallic sphere within the melt using time-resolved X-ray radiography. The high pressure and temperature measurements were performed in a large volume Paris-Edinburgh press. The sample was located in a diamond cylinder with an inner diameter of 0.5 mm and an outer diameter of 1.0 mm in order to minimize changes in the sample shape during heating and pressurisation while maximising X-ray throughput. The diamond capsule were sealed by Pt discs on both sides although we experienced sealing with Re, Mo, Pd and Au80Pd20 disks. Only the diamond capsule and the Pt lid were in direct contact with the melt to prevent undesired chemical reactions. The capsules were placed in a graphite heater, with h-BN as pressure transmitting medium and the whole furnace assembly was then then placed inside a standard 7 mm boron-epoxy gasket <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . The samples was compressed at room temperature to the desired pressure, and then melted by resistive heating with a graphite heater at a rate of 100W/min. Sample melting was monitored by X-ray diffraction using a monochromatic beam and pressure and temperature were calculated from the X-ray diffraction patterns of Pt-hBn calibrants (double isochor method) with equation-of-state parameters. A ~100 µm diameter sphere of Pt was placed on top of each sample and used as viscosity markers. X-ray shadow images of the probing sphere falling through the melt were recorded using a single-crystal YAG phosphor converting the X-ray absorption contrast into visible light recorded by a high speed CCD camera <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . Magma viscosity could then be determined on the basis of the terminal velocity of the falling sphere using the Stokes equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">  E F gd l s s     18 2  </formula><p>Where  is the viscosity, g is the acceleration of gravity (9.81 m/s 2 ),  and d are density and diameter, respectively, with subscripts s and l denoting the probing spheres and liquid,  is the terminal velocity of the falling sphere and F and E are correction factors for wall and end effect respectively. The accuracy of viscosity estimates relies on a precise knowledge of the density of the melt under high P-T. We therefore also performed density measurements using the X-ray absorption method developed by ref.6,7 based on the Beer-Lambert's law.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment difficulties</head><p>During the session we encountered a number of technical difficulties:</p><p>1. The first issue was to find that for one of the sample suite investigated (various mix of a hydrated basalt with a carbonate), a strong chemical reaction occurred between the melt and the probing sphere. The diamond capsules were also found to react with the melt and fractured during experiments. We assigned this reaction to the peculiar chemistry of this sample suite (notably containing Cl) and did not pursue its investigation too long before moving to a different composition. 2. The second difficulty was related to the high melting point (&gt; °C) of some compositions free of CO2 so that parts of the assemblage (lid and probing sphere) would start melting before the sample. We therefore experienced different metals (Re, Mo, Au80Pd20, Au90Pd10, Pd, Pt) as lids before settling on Pt which combined a high-enough melting point with mechanical properties ensuring a good seal of the diamond capsule and an effective transmission of pressure to the sample. 3. The nature of the technique we used, in which the temperature is estimated from the X-ray diffraction patterns of Pt-hBn calibrants, means that radiography imaging of the sample could not be done concurrently with temperature determination (or XRD on the sample to asses if it has reached a completely molten state). In one occasion this limitation meant that we missed the fall of the probing sphere while on XRD mode. 4. Finally, on multiple occasions we could not get the probing sphere to fall through the sample, while the X-ray diffraction signal showed the absence of solid crystalline phases. The accuracy of the viscosity determination is a direct function of the number of radiography images that are acquired during the sphere fall. In order to maximise this number we tried using very small probing spheres, down to 30 µm diameter. The problem with small probing spheres however is that if the viscosity of the liquid is too high they will not fall at the timescale of our experiment. The problem is therefore a circular one with experimental assemblages needing to be tuned to the viscosity of the liquid (the unknown we're trying to determine).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confronting experimental difficulties</head><p>In this section we detail our future plans to tackle the issue presented above. 1. In order to limit reactions of the sphere and diamond capsule with the melt we plan on coating both with a thin Al2O3 film (few µm). 2. Our experience with various materials has now allowed us to define the best experimental assemblages to investigate the compositions of interest. 3. The issue of indirect temperature determination cannot be answered entirely. During our experiments however, we have repeatedly established calibration curves for the graphite furnaces so future experiments will benefit from an a priori determination of the experiment temperature based on the imposed currant intensity. We are also now know that some compositions being more viscous than expected, we should expect a delay before the sphere begins to fall. 4. We are currently performing a series of "classical" piston-cylinders viscometry experiments in order to obtain a first order determination of the viscosity of the investigated liquid. Results from these experiments should allow us to design experimental assemblage better adapted to accurately probe the viscosity of carbonated melts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We performed a total of nine experiments. In no occasion were we able to record the fall of the probing sphere through a pure melt. One fall was successfully recorded but the sphere fell through a mush rather than a pure liquid. Despite the experimental difficulties we were successful, for several samples, in obtaining X-ray transmission profiles trough the quenched glass at ambient conditions and through the melt at high pressure and temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). These data will allow us to determine the density of these melts at the pressure and temperature conditions of their expected formation in the mantle.</p><p>Although we initially hoped to determine the viscosity of carbonated melts we note that density measurements on such low silica high -CO2 compositions are a first. Given the scarcity of data and importance of such melts in the deep carbon cycle we are confident in our ability to publish the results within a year. We are currently determining the density of the glass by an independent method in order to calibrate the obtained absorption profiles.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Example of a background-subtracted X-ray absorbance scan through the diamond capsule and a sample containing 32 mol% SiO2 (calculated dry) and 18 mol% CO2 at (i) ambient conditions, (ii) 1600°C and 1.5 GPa, (iii) 1600°C and 2.0 GPa. The density can be derived from the attenuation coefficient of the sample (μPT).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions and Future work</head><p>Our experimental session has highlighted a number of problems impeding us from obtaining in situ viscosity measurements on carbonated melts. We have now improved the experimental setup in order to target each problem specifically and are currently performing a number of ex-situ experiments which will help us further constrain the experimental assemblage design for future experiments. We believe that the originally proposed experiments are feasible and hope to perform them in the near future. We are therefore re-applying for beamtime.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="4,111.25,226.70,372.60,261.35" type="bitmap" /></figure>
