<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This proposal takes place in the general context of a better understanding of materials degradation mechanisms in extreme environments. In particular, the aim of the present study was to correlate microstructural elements to stress release mechanisms for thermally grown chromia thin films on NiCr alloys. Thus, it was planned to undertake X-ray diffraction measurements in situ during oxidation of the metallic alloys. To this end, a High Temperature induction furnace providing from the ESRF Sample Environment Laboratory was used. In addition, it was decided to use a 2D detector large enough to get sufficient Psi values, to extract the stresses evolution in the chromia films during the course of isothermal oxidation, and also during short plateau just after low temperature jumps (supposed to impose an additional thermal strain). Compared to the previous Proposal (02-02-821) a new 2D camera has been used (FRELON camera providing from the Detector Pool), thus it has been now possible to get the images all along the course of oxidation. Also, concerning the induction furnace providing from the Sample Environment Laboratory, it was optimised thus thermal cycling experiments (regular subsequent high and low temperature jumps) were also possible. Finally, the main part of the planned experiments was undertaken. However, it was decided to focus on the behaviour of only one chromia forming alloy (NiCr).</p><p>Results and the conclusions of the study (main part):</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The main results obtained from these experiments were the study of the stress release mechanism after the low-temperature jumps. In complement, the oxide microstructure development during the course of oxidation is also investigated from both the peaks intensity and width evolution. Studies of in situ XRD were carried out in Synchrotron at the ESRF D2AM line, with an energy of 20 KeV. The dimensions of the X-Ray beam (300 µm * 1500 µm) allows to maximise the diffracted intensity from the earlier oxidation steps. To observe their oxidation and to form the oxide Cr2O3, the samples have been heated in the temperature range 800-1000°C under atmospheric air, with the induction heating stage from ESRF Sample Environment Laboratory. Relatively high heating and cooling rates have been used (150°C/min) to reduce direct oxidation and thus stress build up and stress release during these heating and cooling steps, and in order to highlight the study only during the subsequent plateau.</p><p>A two-dimensional detector capture peaks in reflection mode of the Cr2O3 ceramic film and the NiCr metallic substrate. The kinetic of formation of such phases naturally depends on the oxidation conditions. However, given the chosen configuration for the experimental setup, Cr2O3 lines rapidly appear in addition to the NiCr. From the intensity and the integral width (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) an accurate description of the microstructure was done. In particular, it was clearly shown that the ceramic grains mainly growth during the very initial oxidation period, while the development of the chromia film is continuous during all the first oxidation plateau of 3 hours. The later corresponds to the building of the film microstructure.</p><p>0 50 100 150 200 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 Intensity_1000°C Intensity (a.u) Time (min) 0,10 0,12 0,14 0,16 0,18 0,20 0,22 0,24 0,26 Width_1000°C integral_Width</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> : Intensity and integral width evolution for a chromia microstructure built at 1000°C on NiCr during a first plateau of 3 hours. Finally, four chromia ceramic film microstructures have been built at respectively 800, 850, 900 and 1000°C, with corresponding increasing grain sizes (0.2 to 0.8 m) and film thicknesses (500 nm to 3 m). The eventual presence of texture from the first moments of oxidation has also be appreciated (not shown). Finally and as expected, the X-ray Synchrotron source allows us to perform good quality measurements with a rather high dynamic, in a quite short recording time. After building the microstructures, low temperature jumps were applied, and the internal stress determination was also undertaken from the analyses of the images providing from the 2D detector. It was done both for the initial building period (first plateau), and also just after the low-temperature jumps (subsequent plateaus). An example of the later experiment is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for the microstructure initially built at 1000°C. During the first step observed at 1000°C the mean stress/strain value rapidly drops as a sign of isothermal relaxation. After that, three low-temperature jumps have been imposed, and it is clearly visible from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> that a stress/strain jump is clearly associated to these temperature jumps at respectively 900, 800 and 700°C.</p><p>The low-temperature jump induces as expected an additional compressive strain/stress to the oxide film.</p><p>Then, the creep-relaxation of the thermally grown ceramic is also clearly visible on each plateau. In particular, it appears that the strain rate varies with the temperature as a proof of the thermal activation of the creep mechanism. Thus, from this example, it is evidenced, that for an initial microstructure of the ceramic film initially developed in that case at 1000°C, the subsequent study of the creep behaviour is possible.</p><p>This methodology has been reproduced for the 4 initial microstructures built at 1000, 900, 850 and 800°C.</p><p>And from a confrontation with our modelling (fitted curve in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), the creep mechanism has been identified. Indeed, with a Norton exponent value &lt; 2, the fitted curves well describe the experimental evolution which is consistent with diffusion-creep. The corresponding creep coefficients Jox have been deduced (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) for the first time in chromia thermally grown oxides films.</p><p>0,00075 0,00080 0,00085 0,00090 0,00095 0,00100 0,00105 -82,5 -82,0 -81,5 -81,0 -80,5 -80,0 -79,5 -79,0 -78,5 -78,0 Micro 1-a :1000-900-800-700 Micro 1-b :1000-850 Micro 2-a :900-800-700 Micro 2-b :900-850-800-750 Micro 3 :850-800-750-700 Micro 4 :800-700 Ln(J ox k B T)</p><p>(1/T) Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> : Creep coefficients Jox as a function of the oxidation temperature, for the four initially built microstructures at respectively 1000, 900, 850 and 800°C. Both the initial building temperatures and the ones corresponding to the subsequent plateaus after the jumps are reported.</p><p>The variation of the Jox diffusion-creep coefficients with the temperature has also been reported in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> for the 4 initial microstructures, but also with different applied values (100 or 50°C) of the low temperature jumps. At first, it appears a good reproducibility for the creep coefficients providing from an identical initial microstructure. Then, considering the thermal activation for one initial microstructure, it is clear that intermediaries low temperature jumps induce as expected well intercalated creep coefficient values. Also, for one initial microstructure the variation of the creep coefficients with the temperature are coherent with an Arrhenius law. And the slope is about the same for the 4 initial microstructures. Thus, a corresponding activation energy of about 130 KJ/mol has been deduced. This value is not directly comparable with literature because no such data are available for diffusion-creep in chromia in particular as a thermally grown oxide. However, a tentative can be done to compare with the parabolic kinetic constants obtained from the diffusion limited growth of such chromia films. If we plot the evolution of such kinetic constants with the temperature a value of about 128 KJ/mol is also obtained which seems definitely to confirm the occurrence of diffusion-creep as the main stress release mechanism. Finally, from Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> the size effect associated to the well-known diffusion-creep equation seems also to be satisfied. Indeed and as expected for a fixed temperature, the creep coefficients increase as the grain sizes decrease (visible through the initial building temperatures which induce an increasing grain size when such building temperatures also increase). Such a behaviour is in total agreement with e.g. the Coble equation.</p><p>Data processing is now continuing with the diffraction studies in order to obtain a meaningful description of the microstructure evolution in relation with the oxidation kinetic successive steps, and also to get the stress/strain development and relaxation for all the different specimens and oxidation conditions that have been studied in the present Proposal, in particular now for the specimens which have been tested under thermal cycling conditions. Also from the Jox values for chromia thermally grown oxides films, the associated diffusion coefficients will be obtained in order to determine the elementary mechanisms involved. These kinds of combined experiments represent a first for these high temperature working materials, e.g. chromia formers. In particular, it is a first attempt to obtain the specific viscoplastic characteristics for such thermally grown thin films of ceramic materials.</p><p>Justification and comments about the use of beam time (5 lines max.):</p><p>At the beginning of the project, almost three shifts have been necessary to setup and to calibrate the experimental device, i.e. alignment of the beamline at the desired energy, furnace installation and calibration for the detector. Finally, the total number of analysed samples was about 10. Reference bulk and powder specimens were also analysed at high temperature. It was necessary to take into account the dilatation effect of both the studied material and the sample holder. Finally, the use of Synchrotron Radiation was mandatory to perform such XRD experiments because the diffracting volumes are quite small, high photon flux is required. Furthermore, since the samples under investigations are composed of a stacking of the ceramic film and the metallic substrate (Cr2O3/NiCr) tunable wavelength was required to avoid peaks overlapping.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 : Internal strain evolution as a function of the oxidation time, for four subsequent plateaus of 3 hours, at respectively 1000, 900, 800 and 700 °C.
