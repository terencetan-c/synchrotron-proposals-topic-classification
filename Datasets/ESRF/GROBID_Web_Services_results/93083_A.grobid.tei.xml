We were scheduled for a mail-in experiment in July 2019 (15/07 -17/07). Our local contact was Michael Hons. We shipped our grids in a dry shipper to the ESRF, where they were stored until the allocated time slot. We sent several grids from a batch, which was pre-screened locally on a Glacios microscope and sent images of the grid atlases for various grids to our local contact. Thanks to the outstanding support by him, the data collection was going very well and we obtained a large dataset that members of my team were able to download shortly after the collection had finished.</p><p>We had collected similar complexes before at the ESRF (February 2018, July 2018, November 2018, December 2018, June 2019) and in each case obtained high-quality data. We have recently submitted a paper, which is now accepted at Mol. Cell and contains reconstructions obtained from ESRF data. This is to say that we were extremely pleased with te quality of the data we have received so far and were looking forward to the results from this trip. Maria and Michael, two people in my team working on the project, had already spent some time on optimizing complex formation and grid-freezing protocols. Based on our pre-screening and the atlases we collected, Michael Hons selected all the holes for data acquisition and everything went extremely smoothly.</p><p>We collected in total 5220 micrographs and have picked more than 385.000 particles.</p><p>I would like to stress that this complex is very challenging because we have compositional and conformational heterogeneity, which we cannot control biochemically. Processing and refining is therefore a time consuming task and we are far from being finished. However, after 2D classification and clean-up, Michael started to process the data using downscaled particles corresponding to a pixel-size of 4.4Å. He obtained initial 3D reconstructions and was able to classify the particles based on whether or not density for RNAP was present.</p><p>He is able to control for conformational heterogeneity using novel software tools (Relion 3). At the moment it refines to about 3.6Å resolution but we're confident to reach higher resolution. Importantly, we see density for a ligand, whose presence and location was controversial. We are confident this dataset is the last, missing one in a series of reconstructions that we had to do. We are now in the process of refining it further and have also started with mdoel building and coordinate refinements.</p></div>		</body>
