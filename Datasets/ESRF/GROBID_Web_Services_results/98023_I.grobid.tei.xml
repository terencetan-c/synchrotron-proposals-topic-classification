All data was processed on the fly using the CM01 pipeline; monitored via the ExiMX interface. Movie drift was first corrected using MotionCorr2 and CTF correction performed with gCTF and CTFFind4. Particles are clearly visible at up to -0.8um defocus.</p><p>Data were transferred to the lab, and the movies were processed from within cryoSPARC. The processing was carried out by a collaborator (Michael Hons), and the data are also being processed in Relion.</p><p>3D classification yielded two major classes, one that exhibits dimsnsions typically observed for nsP1 dodecamers, and one where the monomer capping domains are inclined by 8 o relative to the centre of the ring, resulting in an overall dilation of the pore (0.3nm for the inner pore and 0.5nm for the overall ring) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>In both cases, some density corresponding to an m 7 GMP moiety is observed near the catalytic histidine, but the connection between the alpha phosphate and the histidien is unclear, and this data seyt may benefit from another aqusition from grids made with the SAH cofactor present. Nonetheless, this dataset has provided us with important insights into the structural dynamics of the nsP1 capping pathway.

B) In the context of the ring, this corresponds to an inclination by 8o and an opening of the ring.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment title:</head><p>CHIKV nsP1 in complex with m 7 GMP cap structure Cap structures are universally present in eukaryotic mRNA 5' termini, and are critical for RNA stability, processing and translation. Many viruses such as Chikungunya (CHIKV) encode viral enzymes that append cap structures to the viral RNA to mimic host mRNA and hijack the host machinery. The aim of this experiment was to solve the structure of CHIKV nsP1 capping pore covalently bound to the 7-methyl guanosine monophosphate (m 7 GMP) cap0 structure. NsP1 forms a covalent complex with the cap0 via catalytic histidine 37 prior to transfer to the 5' terminal phosphate of the viral RNA. The experiment was performed by Eaazhisai Kandiah, who communicated with us via Skype about the experimental set-up. Four replicate grids of nsP1 with the substrates (Quantifoil R2/2 gold 300 mesh with a graphene oxide coating) that had been pre-screened on the TALOS Artica at the CNB Madrid were loaded into the microscope. The ATLASes corresponded well to those aquired pre-transportation, and data collection was set up with multiacquisition from two of the grids to have enough squares for collection, due to uneven graphene oxide coverage over the grids.</p><p>An automated data collection was set up with the following parameters; 4 images were collected per hole at a magnification of 105,000 in super-resolution mode (corresponding to a super-res pixel size of 0.42 Å/pix and a physical pixel size of 0.839Å/pix), spot size 4, defocus range: -0.8-2.5m, exposure time: 1.8s distributed over</p></div>			</div>
