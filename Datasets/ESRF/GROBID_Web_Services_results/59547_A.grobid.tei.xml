<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">INTRODUCTION</head><p>We proposed to examine samples from degraded minium (Pb3O4) from the Roman-Egyptian period and the Middle ages, showing blackening/formation of Plattnerite (PbO2) with the aim of elucidating the (oxidative) role of Cl. Both original samples and model samples were be examined via Cl-K/Pb-M4,5 edge XANES and XRPD mapping. Based on the literature [1], the following reactions/equilibria may (not all) be responsible:</p><p>(1) Alkaline reaction of Pb 2+ with oxidizing Cl-species, e.g.: Our current hypothesis to explain the presence of the great variety of secondary Pb 2+ -, Pb 4+ -and Clcontaining compounds is that both reducing and oxidising influences may be at work here: in the absence of light and the presence of oxidising Cl species, either reactions (1) or (2) are expected to dominate: depending on the redox/pH circumstances either plattnerite (black) or laurionite (white) are mainly formed. On the other hand, under photo-activation conditions, next to the pathway described in [1], disproportionation reaction (3) and/or reaction sequence (4) may induce the co-existence of Pb3O4 with PbO2 (+ Pb-carbonates) [1], possibly leading to both white (PbCO3) and black (PbO2) secondary products.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Pb 2+ + OCl -+ 2OH - Cl -+ PbO2 + H2O [2] (2)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">EXPERIMENTAL</head><p>XANES spectra were acquired in XRF mode by scanning the primary energy around the Pb-M4,5 edge (2.45-2.65 keV) and Cl K-edge (2.82-2.86 keV) with energy step of 0.2 eV. Investigations under vacuum (10 -6 mbar) were performed both in unfocused mode (collimated beam, 0.2 mm diameter) and by means of a focused Xray beam [0.5 x 0.9 μm 2 diameter (hxv)]. Energy calibration was performed with respect to the first inflection point of a Pb metal foil, which was determined by its first derivative. </p></div>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><figDesc>. During the μ-XRF mapping experiments, the fluorescence signals were generated by employing a monochromatic primary beam of fixed energy (around the Cl and Pb-M4,5 edges). Maps of the same area were recorded at two different excitation energies close to the Cl K-edge: (a) at 2.8216 keV, favoring the excitation of specific Cl-species such as PbCl2, (PbCl)2CO3 and PbOHCl but disfavoring that of NH4Cl, NaCl, MgCl2, KCl, CaCl2 etc. (b) at 2.8922 keV (all Cl species) to obtain a Cl-Kα fluorescence intensity map that is proportional to the total Cl content at a given position (i.e., irrespective of its oxidation state). Maps of the same area were recorded at two different excitation energies close to the Pb-M4,5 edge: (a) at 2.492 keV and (b) at 2.8470 keV (all Pb species) to obtain a Pb-Mα fluorescence intensity maps that allow to discriminate between PbCl/PbCO3/Pb-carboxylate species. Contrari to the expectation, these energies proved to be not informative for distinguishing between Pb(II) and Pb(IV) compounds. The program PyMca was used to fit the fluorescence spectra and separate the different elemental contributions[6].</figDesc></figure>
