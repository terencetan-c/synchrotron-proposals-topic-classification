<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We have applied for 9 shifts on the Titan KRIOS to collect data on a IFT dynein mutant. We were scheduled in July 2019 (22/07 -25/07). Our local contact was Michael Hons. One user from my team, Robert Fagiewicz, traveled to the ESRF. We brought several grids from a batch, which was pre-screened locally on our Polara microscope. Thanks to the outstanding support by our local contact, Robert was able to identify a good grid very quickly, select enough squares and holes and collect data that gave us about 4000 micrographs.</p><p>We have picked more than 500.000 good particles. The class averages after 2D classification clearly revealved secondary structure element like α-helicies. We have now obtained a 3D reconstruction of the IFT dynein mutant at a resolution of 3.6 Å (Figure1). We consider this trip a complete success. </p></div>			</div>
