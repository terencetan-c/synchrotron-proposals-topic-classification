<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Over the past decade, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has proven to be a promising method to deposit noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) with precise control over the size and composition. This has attracted wide interest from the fundamental heterogeneous catalysis research field. During previous DUBBLE campaigns, we collaborated with the DUBBLE team to develop and apply a unique in situ XRF-GISAXS approach during ALD and annealing of Pt NPs. This work provided insights in the tuning opportunities of Pt ALD as well as the coarsening mechanism at high temperatures, and resulted in recent publications in Nature Communications<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> and Nanoscale 2 . During our recent campaign, 26-02/818, we aimed to extend this successful work to the Pd system and 1) study the morphology evolution during ALD of Pd NPs using different plasma reactants, 2) combine Pt and Pd ALD to deposit Pd/Pt core/shell nanoparticles and 3) study the thermal stability of ALD-grown Pd NPs during annealing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental</head><p>Pd NPs were deposited on planar Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 substrates using palladium(II)hexafluoroacetylacetonate [Pd(hfac) 2 ] as precursor and NH 3 , H 2 and H 2 + O 2 (three steps process) plasmas as reactants at 100℃, while in situ XRF spectra and GISAXS patterns were recorded using 30 s measurements (E = 12 keV, α i = 0.5°, sample-detector distance = 3.2 m). In addition, ex situ measurements were performed on Pd samples that were prepared in our homelab using the same ALD setup. Core/shell Pd/Pt NPs were synthesized by depositing Pt on pre-prepared Pd NPs using (methylcyclopentadienyl)trimethylplatinum [MeCpPtMe 3 ] as precursor and NH 3 plasma or O 2 gas as reactant at 300℃ and monitoring the Pt deposition in situ. For the annealing experiments, pre-prepared Pd NPs were annealed to 1000℃ with a ramp rate of 0.2 ℃/s in 21% or 2.1% O 2 /He atmosphere, while in situ GISAXS patterns were recorded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In situ characterization of Pd NP ALD Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows a selection of GISAXS patterns recorded during a first deposition of Pd NPs on Al 2 O 3 using NH 3 plasma as reactant at 100℃ (Fig. <ref type="figure">1(a)</ref>). The scattering along q z near the beam stop (q y = 0 nm -1 ) in the initial pattern originates from the Al 2 O 3 substrate (Fig. <ref type="figure">1(a1)</ref>). With increasing number of Pd ALD cycles, additional scattering maxima appear along q z , which means that the height of the Pd NPs increases. The position of the main scattering peak along q y shifts slightly to lower value during the first ca. 100 ALD cycles and then remains at a fixed position, meaning that the centre-to-centre distance between the Pd nuclei increases slightly at first and remains stable then. This trend is clear in the 2D color map shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1(b1</ref>). In the case of the H 2 plasma (Fig. <ref type="figure">1(b2)</ref>) and H 2 + O 2 plasma (b3) processes, the main scattering peak shifts slowly to lower q y values during the 200 recorded ALD cycles. Overall, we conclude that the Pd NPs grow at a mainly static mode with no obvious cluster mobility or particle ripening during the ALD process. This is in contrast to the Pt ALD process which showed very clear dynamic, diffusion-mediated particle growth when O 2 gas or O 2 plasma are used as reactant. 1 However, when we repeated the NH 3 plasma process again, the Pd growth curve obtained from XRF revealed a degradation of the Pd deposition (Fig. <ref type="figure">1(c</ref>)), likely due to an unexpected degradation of the Pd(hfac) 2 precursor. It is unclear why the chemical degraded during the synchrotron campaign (similar experiments were done in our homelab during the past year without problems). In any case, for future campaigns, we will bring two spare precursor containers that will be thoroughly tested in advance in Gent.</p><p>Ex situ characterization of Pd NP ALD Because of the degradation of the Pd precursor, the original plan to perform in situ experiments during Pd NP growth on SiO 2 substrates could not be carried out. As a backup, pre-prepared samples were measured ex situ with GISAXS. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> compares two of the measured images for Pd samples grown with the NH 3 plasma process with the same Pd loading on a SiO 2 vs. Al 2 O 3 substrate. On Al 2 O 3 the scattering peak appears at a larger q y value (~0.7 nm -<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> ) than on SiO 2 (~0.5 nm -1 ), which reveals a smaller NP center-to-center distance and thus larger Pd NP areal density on Al 2 O 3 than on SiO 2 .</p><p>Pd/Pt core/shell NPs Pre-prepared Pd NPs on Al 2 O 3 were overgrown with Pt to synthesize Pd/Pt core/shell NPs. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the GISAXS patterns before and after 32 cycles of Pt ALD using NH 3 plasma (top) and O 2 gas (bottom). The final GISAXS pattern is very different for the two selected reactants. After the Pt-NH 3 plasma process, the main scattering maximum remains at the same q y position as the original scattering feature of the Pd core particles. In addition, another scattering peak appears at larger q y values. After the Pt-O 2 gas process, the main scattering peak has shifted to lower q y values and a scattering ring has appeared. The different GISAXS patterns are to be explained by a difference in selectivity for the Pt ALD growth on Pd vs. the Al 2 O 3 substrate (O 2 gas process is likely more selective) and by a difference in surface diffusion during the Pt ALD growth (O 2 gas process likely induces more mobility on the surface). Post-characterization of the synthesized samples with TEM is ongoing. This will provide us with the required info to proceed with the analysis of the in situ GISAXS images.</p><p>In situ GISAXS during annealing of Pd NPs At last, annealing experiments were carried out to study the coarsening mechanism of pre-prepared Pd NPs. Samples grown with the NH 3 plasma process with different Pd loading (i.e. different initial particle size) and different substrate (SiO 2 vs. Al 2 O 3 ) were selected. Annealing experiments were performed under 21% and 2.1% O 2 in He atmospheres (1 bar pressure). All samples showed a remarkable stability in 21% O 2 in He atmosphere and particle coarsening only started at 1000°C. This is in large contrast to Pt NPs of similar sizes for which coarsening started at temperatures between 450 and 600°C. 2 Decreasing the O 2 partial pressure to and 2.1% O 2 in He, decreased the onset temperature for NP coarsening to 900°C. This is in line with our Pt work that revealed a decreasing onset temperature with O 2 partial pressure. 2 However, to obtain a deeper understanding of the particle coarsening mechanism of Pd NPs, additional experiments are needed at even lower O 2 partial pressures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This campaign focused on ALD of Pd NPs. Though the Pd process failed, limiting the number of in situ studies that we could perform, important insights have been obtained providing a firm basis for the design of follow-up experiments. Surprising differences with the previously studied Pt system were found: (1) static growth was observed for Pd ALD, even when O 2 plasma was used; (2) Pd NPs show a much higher thermal stability than Pt NPs with comparable size. In addition, the Pd NP areal density is significantly higher on Al 2 O 3 than on SiO 2. Pd/Pt core/shell NPs were synthesized using different Pt ALD chemistries. Their different growth behaviour remains to be analyzed.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><graphic coords="2,66.35,49.50,462.56,175.55" type="bitmap" /></figure>
