<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During this session, the contrast agent and in vivo imaging protocol established in Experimental Session 2 was applied to a larger number of animals to derive anatomical parameters of mouse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space in vivo. Cabling for electrocardiogram, breathing sensor, thermometer as well as tubing for body heater and infusion pump were managed using a drag chain, allowing for full 360° rotation of the setup.</p><p>Mouse body temperature was monitored by a dedicated person outside the hutch during the animal mounting process, as large changes in positioning, heating element contact and heat insulation occur during the procedure. This allowed for minimal delays in temperature adjustment, leading to much more tightly controlled body temperature and greatly increased survival rate of the animals compared to the pilot study.</p><p>SRµCT images were acquired using monochromatic beam at a photon energy slightly above the K-edge of the chosen X-ray contrast agent (37 keV for Ba) and with an effective pixel size of 6.2 µm for a full-width scan of the skull. A short exposure time of 5 ms was chosen to minimize motion artifacts and to capture sufficient projections per cardiac or respiratory cycle. An initial short fly scan with 2000 projections was acquired and reconstructed quickly to confirm positioning of the field of view, proper mounting and health status of the animal. Additional anaesthetics were administered if an elevation in heart rate was observed on the electrocardiogram. For the full scan, 60 000 projections with a full 360° rotation were then acquired while simultaneously recording cardiac and respiratory cycles for retrospective gating.</p><p>Mice were injected into the ventricle with 5 µl barium nanoparticle-based X-ray contrast agent (ExiTron nano 12000) at 0.5 µl/min. This experiment was repeated until fully complete scans of three male and three female live mice were acquired, which required a total of 10 animals.</p><p>In order to improve the physiological accuracy of the data and avoid artificially increasing the intracranial pressure, slower contrast agent injection rates would be required. As injection prior to transfer to the hutch would exceed the time permissible under anaesthesia, a cannula was implanted into the lateral ventricles and connected to a syringe pump installed in the hutch. Contrast agent would then be infused at 0.1 µl/min, matching the natural production rate of cerebrospinal fluid. Fly scans at different time points allowed assessing the contrast agent distribution (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>). Connecting the cannulae while avoiding introducing air bubbles proved technically challenging, however, increasing the length of the sample mounting procedure, which had a detrimental effect on animal survivability. This revealed a need for real-time anaesthesia adjustment via remote-controlled injection or inhalation anaesthesia.</p><p>Artificial ventilation via tracheotomy was used, in addition, to induce a regular breathing frequency, which would allow for combined cardiac and respiratory gating. The Minerva breathing apparatus for rabbits available at the beamline was not suitable for use in mice, due to the larger dead volume. A dedicated mouse breathing apparatus (Hugo Sachs Minivent 845) was brought by the users, which was small enough to be mounted next to the sample on the rotation stage, allowing for minimal tube length and thus dead volume for artificial ventilation. Artificial ventilation successfully stabilized both cardiac and respiratory frequencies (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). As cardiac frequency would change along with breathing frequency, it was not possible to induce equal frequencies for both. Separate gating is therefore still necessary, barring further developments.</p><p>As infusion and tracheotomy were technically more challenging to perform and could only be performed by a limited number of members in the user team, the second night shift could not be used for in vivo experiments due to exhaustion. During this time, cadavers of mice previously scanned in vivo were scanned post-mortem after transcardial perfusion, to measure the changes in anatomy induced by death and fixation. Reconstruction of all data are still in progress.
