<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Using high-resolution x-ray nanodiffraction, we aimed to map the local uniaxial strain fields induced by misfit dislocations in SiGe/Si heterostructures. It has been shown that epitaxial deposition of a low-misfit Si 1-x Ge x film on top of a Si(001) substrate patterned with {111}-faceted pits oriented in a square network along the &lt;110&gt; directions leads to trapping of misfit dislocations. Thin Si-rich SiGe films were therefore deposited on periodic and aperiodic templates realized on Si(001) substrates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>), and laboratory atomic-force microscopy (AFM) was used to check that crosshatch lines were associated with pits (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>).</p><p>At ID01, a 8.47 keV beam was used. This energy was chosen so that the exit angle for the asymmetric (113) reflection would be extremely grazing (1.3° for Si), such that the diffracted signal would come from a region very close to the surface where the relevant effects are expected to be seen. The incidence angle for (113) was around 52°, which maintained a small beam footprint on the sample, and was close to the limit of collision between the optical microscope objective and the x-ray focusing optics. The symmetric (004) reflection was also accessible. A Fresnel zone plate was used and a spot diameter of about 500 nm was obtained.</p><p>Using a newly-developed fast scan mode, diffraction intensity maps in real space were obtained and compared with surface topography maps obtained by AFM. The fast scan mode allows 2-dimensional intensity maps to be obtained extremely quickly as compared to the previously-used method of step-wise scanning, detector image acquisition, and reconstruction (see, for example, experiments SI-1873 and HS-4672) and therefore allows structures within the sample to be immediately identified in detail. The use of an aperiodic pattern allowed direct correlation between AFM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) and diffracted intensity maps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>). A 20 × 20 µm 2 area of the pattern in shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, which demonstrates direct correlation between surface topography and diffracted intensity. Images of the diffracted beam were recorded over a range of incidence angles close to both Si and SiGe ( <ref type="formula">004</ref>) and (113) Bragg conditions (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), so that strain and tilt could be reconstructed in both the substrate and SiGe film using symmetric and asymmetric three-dimensional reciprocal space mapping. These results will eventually be compared with Finite Element Method (FEM) models and micro-Raman spectroscopy results. </p></div>
