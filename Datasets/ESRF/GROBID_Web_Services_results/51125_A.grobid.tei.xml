<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>type [Fe 3 Ln(μ 3 -O) 2 (CCl 3 COO) 8 (H 2 O)(THF) 3 ], where Ln represents the lanthanide cations (Gd, Tb, Dy, and Ho) and Y(III) as pseudo-lanthanide 1 . The Ln atom provides the anisotropy, while the Fe 3 subcluster imposes the magnetic moment. In our previous work 2 , it was reported that upon application of an increasing magnetic field, the two magnetic subsystems (Ln and Fe 3 sublattice) undergo polarization in the field direction. In particular, it was shown that in the Gd and Dy compounds, the Ln is which dominates the total magnetization of the molecule. The present experiment was aimed at deeping in the study of the Fe 3 subcluster-Ln interaction within the {Fe 3 LnO 2 } cluster, by applying a competing external field and low temperatures, to provoke relative reorientation of the Fe and Ln magnetic moments. In order to determine directly the spin and orbital moments of both sublattices (the Fe 3 subcluster and the Ln atom), as well as their dependence with the magnetic field, XAS and XMCD experiments were performed at the Fe L 2,3 -edges and Ln M 4,5 -edges on the {Fe 3 LnO 2 } compounds, with Ln= Y, Gd, Dy, Tb and Ho. Additionally, XMCD(H) measurements in the hysteresis mode were performed by varying the applied field (-9 T &lt; H &lt; 9 T), at the Fe L 3 -edge and Ln M 4 or M 5 edge, to determine the orientation of the Fe sublattice magnetization and the Ln one, respectively. Powder samples were prepared by pressing them onto a double-face carbon tape, which was held in place on the sample platform by means of a copper mask with four teflon screws. Radiation damage tests were performed by plotting the XAS spectra as a function of the time, but no evolution of the XAS signal with time was observed. The Fe sublattice hysteresis curves were obtained "point by point". That is, by fixing an applied field and scanning in energy along the Fe L 3 -edge. Then, by following the high intensity XMCD peak obtained for several fields, ranging between -9 to 9 T, one obtains the XMCD(H) for the Fe sublattice contribution. The first problem arises in the difference between sample and holder temperatures (T). Although, the thermometer placed closest to the sample indicated a T ≈ 3.6 K during the experiment, the analysis of the experimental data indicates a much higher one.</p><p>For the {Fe 3 YO 2 } complex, as Y is non-magnetic, all the magnetic contribution comes from the Fe 3 subcluster. As the molecule is composed by three antiferromagnetically coupled Fe III atoms of spin S=5/2, one would expect a saturation magnetization of 5μ B /Fe 1 . This was confirmed by the SQUID magnetization measurement on this compound and its fitting to the Brillouin function with S=5/2 (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, blue squares and solid line, respectively). In the present experiment, a temperature of about 12 K has been obtained from the fitting of the XMCD Fe L3 (H) to the Brillouin function. Supposing that T= 12 K was the sample temperature during the experiment, the XMCD(H) at the Fe 3 -edge is displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, red circles. According to the ID08 beamline staff, a sample temperature of about 5 K would be reasonable, so the obtained T=12 K indicates the existence of a lack of thermal contact between sample and holder. The second aspect to report is the non-reproducibility of the XAS and XMCD spectra, obtained at the Fe L 2,3 -edges. Comparing these spectra, measured at the highest available field (9 T), with those obtained from the XMCD(H) curve at the same field (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>), we realize that both measurements are not consistent. Indeed, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref> shows that there is a little shift in energy on both, XAS and XMCD, spectra measured in two different moments, i.e. during the Fe L 2,3 scan or during the hysteresis measurement. Moreover, some differences can be discerned in the spectra shape, which imply different areas for the Fe L 3 and L 2 peaks. If both experiments were performed in the same conditions, i.e., on the same sample and with the same pressure, temperature, applied field and procedure of measurement, the only difference is that they were performed at a different time. Our explanation is that the sample temperature is not controlled. The sample preparation method could have an influence on this effect, since when we took out the sample, we realized that the carbon tape was broken into pieces because of the low temperature, and detached from the holder. Moreover, less powder sample than in the initial state remained. In view of the non-reproducibility of the experimental data, we conclude that the HC-661 results are not useful to our research. 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 H= 9 T 700 705 710 715 720 725 730 -0,24 -0,18 -0,12 -0,06 0,00 0,06 Photon Energy (eV) 0,0 0,5 1,0 1,5 2,0 0 1 2 3 4 5 M(B) (μ B /Fe) Brillouin function (S=5/2) M(H) SQUID (T=1.8K) XMCD(H) Fe L 3 -edge (T=12 K?) μ B B/K B T {Fe 3 YO 2 } M tot (H) Fe 3 Y (squid) Fe L 3 -edge Sum rules to FeL 2,3 -edges 700 705 710 715 720 725 730 -0,20 -0,15 -0,10 -0,05 0,00 0,05 Photon Energy (eV) 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 H= 9 T 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 XAS (a.u.)
