<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Objective:</head><p>The objective of this experiment was to gain insight in the oxygen storage capacity of potential electrode materials of a new type of all-solid state oxygen ion battery. Therefore, the oxidation state of Fe, Ni and Co in the electrode materials (La,Sr)FeO3-δ (LSF), La2NiO4+δ (LNO) and (La,Sr)CoO3-δ (LSC), respectively was measured using XANES. For each material, measurements were performed in (i) thin film reference samples and (ii) thin film devices using a special electrode geometry under various electrical polarisations and different temperatures (e.g. in situ conditions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Experimental</head><p>The photon source is the APPLE-II type helical undulator HU-38 at the fundamental harmonic of its emission. Reference samples were measured in the 2 nd experimental hutch (EH3) under vacuum and at T = 298K in a topup 7/8+1 multibunch filling mode for better beam stability and nearly constant beam current of 200 mA, with injections every hour. The intensity detector used was a silicon photodiode and the total fluorescence yield (TFY) was collected in backscattered geometry (detector plane at 90° respect the beam vector).</p><p>The in situ measurements were performed in oxygen atmosphere (1atmo) using a temperature cell (Nextron), equipped with 6 tips for electrical contacts and a Kapton window. A schematic of the electrochemical device architecture, used for in and ex situ polarisation measurements, is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1(a-c</ref>), consisting of two partly burried Pt top electrodes (connected with either 0, 1 or 3 thin Pt bridges), the oxide thin film and a 100nm thick ZrO2 capping layer on top of a YSZ single crystal substrate with a Pt-infiltrated (Ce,Gd)O2 back electrode, which is short-circuited to the grounded top electrode. Two silicon drift detectors 1 were used to collect the partial fluorescence yield (PFY) in backscattering configuration. A thin (10-20µm) Mn, Fe, or Co foil was inserted in front of the SDD to reduce elastic scattering for Fe, Co and Ni K-edge measurements, respectively. A beam spot size of ~200 μm was set with the secondary slits and it was used for low-photon density XANES over large areas. Polyscans were performed in narrow energy ranges around the adsorption edge positons of Fe, Ni and Co. For time-resolved measurements, the beam was fixed at an energy close to the K-edge inflection points and intensity was followed over time. A Keithley 2410 sourcemeter was used to polarise the battery devices and establish a lateral oxygen gradient within the thin film.</p><p>3. Results: For each of the three oxide materials, a set of 5 samples was studied, as outlined in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The oxide film thickness was 200nm. For the ex situ measurement, an oxygen chemical potential gradient was frozen into the device by quenching it from 400°C in O2 atmosphere under applied voltage to room temperature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structure</head><p>Reference thin film samples as grown oxide/YSZ reduced 400°C, humidified H2 oxidized 400°C, O2 Electrochemical devices ex situ 400°C, O2, under bias ZrO2 /oxide/Pt/YSZ/Pt-(Ce,Gd)O2 in situ Table 1: Overview of 5 studied samples for each oxide material: LSF, LSC, LNO In a first experiment the frozen oxygen gradient was mapped using X-ray absorption spectroscopy at room temperature (ex situ). Spectra of the Fe K-edge were recorded at different positions on the sample along the voltage gradient. Two features of these spectra were analysed: The inflection point of the absorption edge (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>) and the position of the relative maximum at energies below the absorption edge, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. The position shift of these features are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>. The position of the pre-edge maximum and the inflection point both shift with polarization by -0.65 and -0.45 eV, respectively. Despite the different magnitude of the shift, both features show the same dependence on voltage: Both features shift very little between 0 and -0.1 V, followed by a steep decrease between -0.1 and -0.35 V and a 2 nd plateau between -0.35 and -0.8 V. The energies of both plateaus agree well with the energies measured in the reference samples, where the oxygen nonstoichiometry δ of LSF thin films is well known, e.g. equals 0 for the oxidised and 0.2 for the reduced film. This confirms that by applying a voltage we can reduce the sample from δ = 0 (at 0 V) to δ = 0.2 (below -0.35 V). In the second experiment a voltage gradient was applied at 400 °C in a pure oxygen atmosphere and the sample was characterized under these conditions in-situ. The results obtained from this in-situ measurement of the gradient (not shown here) were similar to those measured on the ex-situ sample, with an oxygen window of Δδ≈0.2 at elevated temperature. The capacity of such oxygen ion battery electrode therefore accounts to about 50mAh/g (300mAh/cm³).</p><p>To investigate the kinetics of the oxygen non-stoichiometry variation (e.g. charging characteristics), voltage steps from 0 to -0.6 V and from -0.6 to 0 V were applied to the sample and the absorption was then measured as a function of time at different temperatures. Rather than recording full spectra, the intensity at one single energy (7129.7 eV, at the absorption edge inflection point) was measured continuously, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>. From these time series time constants were extracted by fitting the data to a single exponential. These time constants were then fitted to an Arrhenius equation to estimate the activation energies of underlying electrochemical processes, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>. Activation energies of 1.1 and 0.3 eV were estimated for the forward (0 to -0.6 V) and reverse (-0.6 to 0 V) steps. Lastly, the build-up of the stoichiometry gradient was studied as a function of time and voltage between the gradient endpoints to define the operation window of a potential oxygen battery. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref> shows the intensity at the polarized endpoint of the gradient vs. time for different endpoint voltages. Essentially, a notable stoichiometry gradient first emerges at -0.3 V and is fully established at -0.5 V. This is in good agreement with the results obtained on the ex-situ characterized sample. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref> shows the incremental build-up of a spatial gradient with increasing voltage at the gradient end points. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref> shows the same curves normalized to the voltage at the respective spatial positions. The excellent agreement of the individual data confirms that with this sample design we establish a defined linear potential gradient along our sample and thus validates the experiment design. a) b) c)</p><p>edge position are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>, with the derivative in the inset. For the highest polarization of -0.8eV we observe a shift of about -0.6eV, which corresponds to δ≈0.2, and similarly to LSF a capacity of about 50mAh/g. The edge shift as a function of applied bias was directly followed by measuring the intensity at fixed energy (E=7726.14eV) and using a rigid shift model, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref> (highlighted within red frame) and as function of the bias in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5c</ref>. The edge shift follows an S shaped curve, with saturation within the shown voltage range. The light blue shaded area corresponds to the error in the determination of the absorption edge shift due to changes in the slope around the inflection point with bias. However, the tendency of the shift follows the trend of the shift obtained by full reference scans (red markers). La 2 NiO 4+δ (LNO) While in LSF and LSC oxygen non-stoichiometry is due to the formation of oxygen vacancies, the main defects in LNO are oxygen interstitials. We have investigated the solubility of excess oxygen via reference annealings under different atmospheres and in situ via an electrical driving force. The energy shifts for about 0.6eV from the reduced state with δ=0.06 to the oxidised state with a larger oxygen off-stoichiometry of δ=0.16, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>. A similar shift is obtained in situ under a polarization of -0.8V in oxygen atmosphere, which proofs that effective and real pO2 are equivalent as driving force for changes in the oxygen stoichiometry and therefore as mechanism to charge and discharge the electrode within a battery cell. In contrast to LSF, we did not find a plateau of constant energy nor sharp transitions between 0 and -0.8eV. Cyrstallographically speaking, the limit for oxygen interstitials in LNO is δmax=2, while experimentally only about 10% can be filled under atmospheric pressure. To analyse the oxygen off-stoichiometry window the voltage was swept between -1.2V and +1V, while the intensity was constantly recorded at the inflection point energy, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7a</ref>. Applying the rigid shift model one obtains the edge shift, shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7b</ref>, where a Scurved transition can be observed within the set V range, with saturation below -1V and above +0.6V. The energy window accounts to about 0.9eV and thus Δδ≈0.15, which results in an oxygen storage capacity of about 20mAh/g (150mAh/cm³). The observed hysteresis in the branch of decreasing voltage is likely caused by kinetic effects, as the measurements were performed out of equilibrium. The oxide needs a finite time to counterbalance the applied voltage by changing its oxygen stoichiometry, as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7c</ref>. The time constants vary significantly for LSF and LNO and are therefore likely related to oxygen transport mechanism relevant to charging and discharging behaviour, rather than oxygen diffusion through the YSZ layer, as well as oxygen reduction and evolution reactions on the porous Pt-CGO back electrode. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions:</head><p>XANES measurements were performed on three different electrode materials for a new type of solid state oxygen ion battery. The oxygen off-stoichiometry is the crucial parameter for the potential capacity of such a device and thus was investigated under ex situ and in situ conditions. Comparison with ex situ annealed reference films allowed to relate bias induced changes in the absorption spectra to modifications of the oxygen defect densities, such as vacancies and interstitials, and hence proofed the equivalence of effective and real pO2 conditions. It was shown, that in all three oxides the oxygen non-stoichiometry can be electrochemically tuned within a δ range of 0.15-0.2, leading to capacities of 20-50mAh/g (150-300mAg/cm³) at operation temperatures between 400 and 500°C. Charging and discharging characteristics were studied as function of temperature and applied polarization using time resolved XAS measurements at constant energy. Extracted time constants show Arrhenius type behaviour and varied 1-2 orders of magnitude between different materials, which indicates that they are related to oxygen transport mechanism within the oxide and thus relevant to battery performance. Overall, this proof of concept study showed that LSF, LSC and LNO are promising oxide materials for the integration into a novel battery family, which is envisaged to show long lifetime, reduced environmental impact and avoid toxic and hazardous materials.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Electrochemical device configuration for in situ polarization measurements and its cross section (b), indicating linear decay of applied potential, η, and corresponding effective pO 2 .

La 0.6 Sr 0.4 FeO 3-δ (LSF)In a first experiment the frozen oxygen gradient was mapped using X-ray absorption spectroscopy at room temperature (ex situ). Spectra of the Fe K-edge were recorded at different positions on the sample along the voltage gradient. Two features of these spectra were analysed: The inflection point of the absorption edge (see Figure2a) and the position of the relative maximum at energies below the absorption edge, see Figure2b. The position shift of these features are shown in Figure2c. The position of the pre-edge maximum and the inflection point both shift with polarization by -0.65 and -0.45 eV, respectively. Despite the different magnitude of the shift, both features show the same dependence on voltage: Both features shift very little between 0 and -0.1 V, followed by a steep decrease between -0.1 and -0.35 V and a 2 nd plateau between -0.35 and -0.8 V. The energies of both plateaus agree well with the energies measured in the reference samples, where the oxygen nonstoichiometry δ of LSF thin films is well known, e.g. equals 0 for the oxidised and 0.2 for the reduced film. This confirms that by applying a voltage we can reduce the sample from δ = 0 (at 0 V) to δ = 0.2 (below -0.35 V).</figDesc><graphic coords="2,34.00,271.98,529.91,79.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
