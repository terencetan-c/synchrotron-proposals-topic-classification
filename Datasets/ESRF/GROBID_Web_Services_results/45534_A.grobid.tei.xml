<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Cd is extremely toxic even at low concentrations, and it is easily taken up by plants and transferred to the food chains thus presenting risk for animal and human health <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The use of plants that are able to take up extreme metal concentration (so called hyperaccumulators) had appeared as promising way for metal removal from soil; however, more knowledge on plant metal accumulation and detoxification mechanisms is needed before they can be successfully introduced into phytoextraction applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. The differences in metal compartmentalisation on tissue, cellular and sub-cellular levels are one of the basic tolerance mechanisms in these plants, so localization studies are of fundamental importance to clarify and understand them. In this study we used µ-XRF imaging and µ-XANES to obtain direct information on localization and chemical state of Cd in tissues of Cd hyperaccumulator Thlaspi praecox grown in nutrient solution supplied with 100 µM Cd as CdSO 4 or CdCl 2 . In preliminary study we have found out that plants supplied with CdSO 4 accumulated significantly higher Cd concentrations in their leaves then plant supplied with CdCl 2 . The observation that chemical form of Cd added to the nutrient solution influences the level of Cd accumulation is novel, so studies of localization and chemical state of Cd in leaves and roots were aimed to resolve the mechanisms of accumulation and tolerance of Cd at tissue, cellular and sub-cellular level with the possible involvement of sulphur metabolism. Within the obtained beam-time we have managed to map Cd and simultaneously S, Cl, Mg and Zn using zone plate micro-focusing (excitation energy of 3.55 keV) in different leaf regions (epidermis, mesophyll and veins) of T. praecox plants treated with 100 µM Cd as CdSO 4 or CdCl 2 added to the nutrient solution. In the regions with high Cd concentrations µ-XANES spectra were recorded using zoneplate micro-focusing, while in tissues with lower Cd concentrations (e.g. veins) XANES spectra were recorded using 60 µm pinhole. Pure thin-foil standard reference materials were measured in order to calibrate XRF system and quantify the results obtained by µ-XRF mapping using the software, which is under development in our research group. In addition XANES spectra of reference Cd compounds (CdSO 4 , CdS, CdCl 2 , Cd-pectinate, Cd-celulose, Cdglutathione) in form of solid pellets were measured using 60 µm pinhole.</p><p>Plant samples were prepared in our labor as CdSO 4 or CdCl 2 using cryo-fixation, cryo The sections were mounted in a sandwich between two Al holders with ultralene and attached to the target holder of the SXM. in leaves on (sub)cellular level experimental methods with increased sensitivity are required since the absolute concentrations of Cd in different around 500 ppm. In addition, superior lateral resolution is needed in order to enable localization at the sub cellular level. Such lateral resolution is easily achieved by the SEM limited by the detection limits, typically in the order of 0.1%, which is not enough to perform localization of metals in trace amounts (few 10 to few 100 ppm) which is required in our study. The Scanning X Microscope (SXM) at the ID21 beamline is perfectly suitable to perform the proposed study providing the sensitivity down to ppm level combined with excellent lateral resolution and has been already used successfully for metal localization in plant tissues chemical form(s) of Cd employing the signal (L3 line at 3.134 keV) partially overlaps with the strong neighbouring K signal (K which makes Cd mapping almost impossible beam between the Cd L3 edge (3.538 keV) and potassium K edge enhancing significantly the sensitivity for the Cd detection.

Obtained XRF spectra were processed using PyMCA software.</p><p>The preliminary results showed that in leaves the pattern of Cd accumulation was similar in both treatments (maps of CdCl 2 treatment not shown) cells a strong colocalization with Cl was was found (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). In mesophyll cells, however, Cd colocalization with Cl was observed especially in the cell walls (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) and colocalization with sulphur was also observed 2c). One has to be aware, however that colocalization of two elements does not necessary mean that the two elements are actually coordinated to each other, therefore positions (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Plant samples were prepared in our laboratory from plants grown in nutrient solution with added fixation, cryo-sectioning at -30 °C and freeze-drying at The sections were mounted in a sandwich between two Al holders with 12 2 mm and attached to the target holder of the SXM. In order to perform the comparison of Cd localization on (sub)cellular level experimental methods with increased sensitivity are required since the d in different dry plant tissue samples grown in controlled environment vary superior lateral resolution is needed in order to enable localization at the sub cellular level. Such lateral resolution is easily achieved by the SEM-EDS technique but in this case we are limited by the detection limits, typically in the order of 0.1%, which is not enough to perform localization of metals in trace amounts (few 10 to few 100 ppm) which is required in our study.

In similar previous studies Cd was found to be linked to sulphur and oxygen ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. We have also shown that different Cd ligands may exist in epidermal and mesophyll cells, which was also not known before <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. In veins of plants treated with CdSO 4 and CdCl 2 there are no distinct differences in chemical state of Cd, so we conclude that the mechanisms of uptake, compartmentalization, complexation and transport at the root level probably govern the level of Cd accumulation in shoots. Therefore, further studies on localization and chemical forms of Cd as well as involvement of sulphur compounds in different root parts of T. preacox are needed to understand the differences in Cd uptake between CdSO 4 and CdCl 2 treated plants.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Epidermal-mesophyll region of plants treated with 100 µM CdSO with 1 µm 2 resolution. a) cadmium, b) chlorine,</figDesc></figure>
