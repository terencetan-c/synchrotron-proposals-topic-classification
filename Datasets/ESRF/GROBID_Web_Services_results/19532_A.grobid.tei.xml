<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Spontaneous lateral composition modulation (LCM) in III-V semiconductors modifies significantly their optoelectronic properties. Recent studies show that LCM can be manipulated by growing short-period superlattices of two mismatched components by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. Such a superlattice exhibits a lateral modulation of the thicknesses of the layers resulting in a lateral modulation of the mean chemical composition of the superlattice. In evidence of this modulation, lateral satellites around Bragg diffractions in x-ray reciprocal space indicate the formation of LCM on a macroscopic scale <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. From the distance of these maxima the period of LCM can easily be determined. However, a quantitative determination of the modulation amplitude was a subject of a single short paper <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, where the analysis has been based only on a single trial measurement.</p><p>The goal of the reported measurement was to determine precisely the modulation of the chemical composition of InAs/AlAs superlattices grown on substrates with different miscuts under various growth conditions. For this purpose, using a wavelength of λ = 1.545 Å we have performed the following scattering measurements at beamline ID10B:</p><p>(1) coplanar asymmetric x-ray diffraction 404 (XRD) (2) grazing incidence diffraction 400 (GID) (3) grazing incidence small-angle scattering (GISAXS). Since we have restricted ourselves only to the zero-order satellite peak of the vertical superlattice, instead of the actual sample structure the x-ray "see" only a vertically averaged single In x Al 1-x As layer, whose chemical composition x is modulated laterally. Here we show only the experimental data of sample EA0532, the results of other samples are similar. The sample consisted of 100 periods, each period contains nominally 1.952 monolayer (mL) InAs and 1.466 mL AlAs. The superlattice stack has been grown by MBE on an InAlAs lattice matched buffer layer deposited on (001) GaAs substrate with miscut 2 o , the direction of LCM was close to [100] and it coincided with the miscut direction.</p><p>4,05 4,10 4,15 4,20 4,25 4,40 4,45 4,50 Q x (1/Å) Q z (1/Å) 4,10 4,15 4,20 4,25 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 Intensity (cps) Q x (1/Å) -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 10 20 30 exp. values 0.12 0.14 0.15 0.16 p integrated intensity (arb. u.) 0,00 0,05 0,10 0,15 0,20 0,25 10 0 10 1 10 2 coordinate along the cut (1/Å) Intensity (cps) -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 0,0 0,5 1,0 1,5 exp. values 0.14 0.15 0.16 0.17 p integrated intensity (arb. u.)</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows the XRD reciprocal space map. Apart from the vertical coherent truncation rod at Q x = 4.15 Å, lateral intensity satellites are visible, from their distance a LCM period of (280±5) Å was determined. The vertical positions of the satellites with negative and positive orders are different (see the green lines in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The reason for this shift is not clear yet. In order to determine the modulation amplitude, we have extracted a linear scan from the measured intensity map and we have fitted the satellite maxima on this scan with lorentzian curves. The areas under these curves (i.e. the integrated intensities of the lateral satellites) were compared with numerical simulations based on anisotropic elasticity theory and kinematical x-ray scattering. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. The best correspondence with the theory was achieved for the modulation amplitude A = (15±1)%. Similar results have been obtained in GID. The direction of LCM was slightly inclined from [100] and consequently the lateral satellites were aligned not exactly parallel to the diffraction vector. Therefore, in order to determine the satellite intensities correctly, we have measured a three-dimensional intensity map around the 400 reciprocal lattice point. From this map we have extracted a linear scan along the LCM and again, the integral intensities of the satellites were compared to the theory (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.) Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The same situation as in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>, grazing incidence diffraction.</p><p>From the GID data, the modulation amplitude A = (16±1)% follows.</p><p>The XRD and GID methods are sensitive mainly to the lateral strain modulation in the sample. In order to study the modulation of the shape of the interfaces (i.e. the thickness modulation) we have used GISAXS, which is sensitive only to the density modulation. In the GISAXS geometry, we have measured the -0,04 -0,02 0,00 0,02 0,04 Q x (1/Å) -0,04 -0,02 0,00 0,02 0,04 Q x (1/Å) -0,04 -0,02 0,00 0,02 0,04 -0,04 -0,02 0,00 0,02 0,04</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q x (1/Å) Q y (1/Å)</formula><p>distribution of the scattered intensity in the reciprocal plane Q z = const, i.e. parallel to the sample surface. The results are plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The reciprocal space intensity distributions measured in Q x Q y plane parallel to the sample surface in GISAXS for three various values of Q z 0.028 Å -1 (left), 0.335 Å -1 (middle) and 0.649 Å -1 (right panel).</p><p>The maximum in the center of the intensity map is the coherent truncation rod, the lateral satellites due to the LCM are visible up to the ±2 nd order. In the analysis of the measured data we have assumed that all the interfaces in the multilayer are similar and the local displacement of the interface from its mean position can be described by the function</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">) / 4 sin( ) / 2 cos( ) ( 2 1 L x U L x U x U π + π =</formula><p>, where L is the LCM period and the coefficients U 1,2 have been determined from the experimental data. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref> we have plotted the shape of a single LCM period following from the fit of the GISAXS data to the theory. The shallow wave on the inclined side of the interface shape is a numerical artifact; however, the asymmetry of the interface profile is obvious. This asymmetry does not follow from a macroscopic theory of lateral modulation [3] and most likely, it is caused by a microscopic structure of a vicinal growing surface.</p><p>In summary, using x-ray diffraction and small-angle x-ray scattering, we have determined the period, the modulation amplitude and the shape of the lateral spontaneous modulation in a short period InAs/AlAs superlattice. Further studies are necessary in order to improve the resolution in the shape of the modulation.</p><p>[1] K. Y. Cheng, K. C. Hsieh, and J. N. Bailargeon, Appl. Phys.
