<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Due to MCA software problems no data was obtained for this experiment. A new software system had been installed within the ESRF (I think) which caused many and varied faults to occur with the collection of data using the energy dispersive detector and the MCA system. The experimental set up was completed by about mid afternoon of the 4 th but despite great efforts by the beamline staff, particularly by Paul Thompson, the faults in the software could not be overcome.</p><p>With two shifts remaining I decided to abandon the experiment and move on to experiment number 28 01 618 which was to run immediately after 614. If there is any way this lost time can be clawed back it would be much appreciated. The data was to complete the PhD study of Kalotina Geraki. At present this data will have to be omitted from the final submission which is not the end of the world but it would have been nice to have completed an otherwise very successful set of measurements from the beamline. Again I would like to stress that the problems were in no way associated with the beam line or the staff.</p><p>Experiment 618 experience non of the above problems and was very successful.</p><p>Report to follow as soon as data is fully analysed.</p></div>		</body>
