<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental report number: 28-01-138</head><p>The aim of this experiment was to continue the study of TmNi 2 B 2 C using resonant xray diffraction. Our first experiment on this material performed far from resonance <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> suffered badly from the instability of the beam. We decided to study the field and temperature dependence of the magnetisation "on-resonance" to increase the magnetic signal and hence reduce the problems caused by the beam fluctuations. The resonant technique cannot measure the magnetisation densities directly but was used to investigate the behaviour of the magnetisation around T C . This was realised by measuring the flipping ratio at the Tm L 3 edge (8.468 keV) with the field applied along the c-axis, i.e. in the vertical direction (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which is the axis of greatest net magnetisation. In our experiment, the beam was scattered at 71° corresponding to the (220) reflection. The sample's magnetisation was reversed using the XMaS electromagnet in order to produce the necessary difference measurement. The sample was cooled down with the low temperature displex. The diffracted intensity was recorded with a cyberstar detector, which is linear up to 100,000 cps.</p><p>In our experiment, the beam was scattered at 71° corresponding to the (220) reflection. The results are illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> for two magnetic field values. First, it can be seen that the flipping ratio is enhanced by a factor of 40 compared to the nonresonant technique [1] with a field of 0.6 T applied along the easy axis. The systematic errors were found to be much larger than the statistical errors. The former were calculated as being the standard deviation from the average flipping ratio. The size of these errors is due to the instability of the beam and the inaccurate reading of the temperature (±800 mK). However, the results suggest that the induced thulium moment exists for all the temperatures, i.e. in the normal and superconducting states. The flipping ratio varies consistently with respect to the susceptibility curve [2 ]and scales with the field. This suggests that the induced Tm moment is independent of the volume fraction that is superconducting. There does not seem to be anomalous behaviour around T C . Although the flipping ratio is enhanced working at the Tm L 3 edge, the data prove that the measurements are still affected by beam fluctuations. The smaller the flipping ratio, the bigger the error due to orbit movements.</p></div>
