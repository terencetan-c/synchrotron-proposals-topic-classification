<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The project focuses on studies of metal hydrides based on light-weight elements. During the last few years different so-called alantes e.g. LiAlH 4 , NaAlH 4 containing up to 10 wt% hydrogen have been intensively studied. Even though these materials have been known for a long time, details about structure of the starting material and desorption products are defective. For possible applications, doping/catalysts are needed, but the effect of the catalyst/dopants on the absorption / desorption process is not understood.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The high-resolution experiments were carried out on the following samples: </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>(a) NaAlD 4 , pure and doped with TiCl 4 (3 samples). (b) LiAlD 4 doped with VCl 3 and (Ti,Al)Cl 3 (4 different samples). (c) KAlD 4 .All samples were in 0.5 mm boron-glass capillaries. The wavelength was 0.49972 Å.(a) NaAlD 4 . Ti additives gives a large reversible storage capacity, and it is very important to understand the nature of the Ti additives, which improves the desorption kinetics and makes reversibility possible. NaAlD 4 (pure, 2% TiCl 4 , 6% TiCl 4 and 10% TiCl 4 ) was measured at room temperature. At the moment, data analysis to find the positions of Ti is being carried out. Preliminary analyses suggest a secondary cubic phase with a ≈ 5.6 Å. (b) LiAlD 4 . LiAlD 4 doped with 2 and 5 mol% VCl 3 and (Ti,Al)Cl 3 , respectively, were studied. The samples were prepared by ball-milling, and the motivation was to study how doping influences the structures. No changes in the LiAlD 4 unit cells were observed by doping. Determination of the phase compositions showed that the doping procedure induced a partial decomposition of LiAlD 4 into Li 3 AlD 6 , LiD and Al. The VCl 3 gave the smallest degree of decomposition. Nevertheless some peaks still remain unexplained, and work is in progress. (c) KAlD 4 . The structural arrangement of KAlD 4 has been suggested by Bastide et al. (Rev. Chim. Min. 24 (1987) 248) and Vajeeston et al. (to be published) based on density-functional total-energy calculations. A sample of KAlD 4 with small amounts of LiF was studied in the experiments on BM01B. The step-length for the data collection was 0.008° in 2θ. A Rietveld refinement is shown below. The refined parameters are: a = 8.8448, b = 5.8035, c = 7.3367 Å in space group Pnma. Detailed structural refinements are in progress using the combination of the present synchrotron X-ray diffraction data and neutron diffraction data from the PUS diffractometer at the JEEP II reactor at IFE, Kjeller in Norway.</figDesc></figure>
