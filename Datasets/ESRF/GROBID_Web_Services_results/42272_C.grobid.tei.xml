<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>A grating based directional dark-field imaging experiment was conducted at ID19. The used grating interferometer was designed for the 11 th Talbot distance (477 mm) at 17.6 keV. The detector used was a FReLoN CCD, with a 7.46 micron pixelsize, yielding a FOW of 15x15 mm2. Experiments were made with different grating alignment (horizontal and vertical). Experiments were also conducted at 33 keV for comparison.</p><p>A medical case study was conducted on a number of rat brain slices. The samples were very nicely prepared. But the signal from the samples were unfortunately too weak to be measured with the present experimental configuration.</p><p>A second line of study was conducted on directional dark-field imaging of strongly oriented samples. These studies explored non-sinusoidal variations in the visibility signal for strongly ordered systems. The results were published in Physical Review B: Jensen et al. 'Directional x-ray dark-field imaging of strongly ordered systems' Physical Review B 82 214103 (2010).</p><p>A third line of study was conducted on phase-contrast imaging of porcine fat and rind. These studies explored the possibility of using a grating interferometer to study different quality related properties of porcine fat and rind.</p><p>The results are published in Meat Science. Jensen et al. 'X-ray phase-contrast tomography of porcine fat and rind', Meat Science (2011) (no number yet available, doi:10.1016/j.meatsci.2011.01.013) Figure 1: Outline of the experimental set-up.
