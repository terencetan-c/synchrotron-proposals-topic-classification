<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction:</head><p>Gallium nitride (GaN) is a III-V direct band gap semiconductor and well suited for a range of applications such as optoelectronics and high-power electronics due to its special properties. However, GaN still presents low efficiency and this mainly due to the high dislocation density generated in the GaN epitaxial layer. Therefore, improving GaN heteroepitaxy methods is essential for producing more efficient GaN platelet. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates the four steps of an origin approach for GaN heteroepitaxy. It consists of growing GaN platelets on patterned Si-On-Silicon Oxide pillars (so-called SOI, for silicon on insulator). The viscoelastic properties of SiO2 are expected to help in the process of growing low density GaN platelets. To further understand and optimize this procedure, as well as to characterize the obtained GaN layers, different samples were analyzed under the beam line ID01.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment:</head><p>Due to the lack of time only two samples were characterized under the beam line ID01 with a scanning step ‚àÜùë• = ‚àÜùë¶ = 100ùëõùëö. At 9 keV, the beam spot size was 100 nm (V) and 130 nm (H) (FWHM), however, the effective spatial resolution also depends on the incidence angle and the sample thickness. Different coalescence levels within the same sample can be observed due to the variation in the pitch and diameter of the pillars. Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> show images of sample TS0438 with GaN pyramids at a level of no coalescence at all (L7) and others at the start of coalescence (L2).   In order to understand the coalescence process, measurements were performed around the Si(111) Bragg peak for varied incidence angles w. Rays from Si substrate were also detected, along with rays from different GaN planes. In the following paragraph, the results of these experiments are analyzed and reported.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion:</head><p>Using X-SOCS software, the data from the ID01 beam was examined to create a reciprocal map at each position of the sample in order to calculate the lattice parameter and estimate the in-plane and out-of-plane strain distributions. We present in this report the examination of the acquired data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TS0438_L2_Plots Si (111)</head><p>A rocking curve was performed at each position of the sample and 80 scans were registered. The Bragg peak was detected for a Bragg angle w= 13.3¬∞. Diffraction spots from Si(111) plots are clearly detected and the hexagonal structure as well. However, we notice that the position of the sample is changing throughout one rocking curve; from scan number 33 to scan number 41, the sample moves progressively upward as illustrated in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>. This shift was also visible in the experiment notebook from the images taken during the experiment. Because the shift was not linear from one scan to the other, a correction of this shift using one scan as a reference was difficult.</p><p>From the data obtained in K-Map, X-SOCS software can perform numerical Gaussian fitting for the Bragg peak to determine its position in reciprocal space (Qx, Qy, Qz) as seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> below for TS0438_L2_Si (400). This unclear result of three diffraction peaks in the reciprocal space is probably due to the shift in the samples position. Furthermore, the incident beam does not fall perpendicularly on the sample, which means the diffracted ray might originate from multiple plots causing more complexity in the results. Therefore, to improve the spatial resolution, we analyzed the data from the diffraction of GaN ( <ref type="formula">204</ref>) of the sample TS0440 where the direct beam falls perpendicularly on the substrate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TS0440_L5_GaN (204)</head><p>Results from the measurements of GaN ( <ref type="formula">204</ref>) in TS0440_L5 are expected to be at a high resolution since a Bragg peak was detected at an incidence angle w=90¬∞ and the plots are well separated (P=1¬µm). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref> shows the findings of three scans out of a total of one hundred. Similar results were observed and the shift in the sample's position remains. This issue could be caused by a variety of factors, like a sample fixation problem or a motor problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion:</head><p>In order to describe the process of GaN heteroepitaxy on SOI pillars and characterize the obtained samples, rocking curve scans were performed under the beam line ID01 for two different samples. Diffraction spot were detected for Si (111), Si (400) and different GaN planes. The construction of the reciprocal space in order to obtain the tilt and strain distribution was not accurate because of a shift in the sample's position. Therefore, no further improvements in the analysis was possible. This issue will be considered in the future, and efforts to improve the sample quality will continue in order to be obtain GaN platelets with low dislocation density.</p><p>4.606 4.608 4.610 4.612 4.614 4.616 4.618 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Int (a.u.) qz (A-1)</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: (a) SOI substrate with thin layers of AlN and GaN, (b) nano-patterned pillars, (c) grown GaN pyramids on top of the pillars and (d) fully coalesced GaN platelets.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,39.50,631.48,181.95,68.50" type="bitmap" /></figure>
