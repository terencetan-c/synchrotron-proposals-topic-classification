<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report :</head><p>The ternary cerium boride CeRhSBz, which crystallizes in the hexagonal CeCoaBz structure (space group PG/mmm), has attracted considerable interest due to its anomalous ferromagnetism. Its Curie temperature 2'~ = 115 K is by far the highest Curie temperature of known Ce compounds with nonmagnetic constituents. It is even beyond that of GdRhsBz (Tc = 90 K), in clear contrast to the de Gennes law prediction. Its saturation magnetization at low temperature is strongly reduced relative to the free ion value: /~bdk = 0.42 p~/Ce. This moment lies perpendicular to the c axis. Photoemission spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy as well as a La substitution study indicate that the Ce ions are in a trivalent state. According to a polarized neutron scattering study, the low temperature value of the total magnetic moment of the 4f electrons is &amp;4f) = 0.56 FB [I]. This study shows that both orbital and spin magnetic moments of the Rh 4d electrons, &amp;,(4d) and ph(4d) respectively, are very small. Several models have been proposed to explain the magnetic properties of CeRh&amp;. One of them supposes that its anomalous ferromagnetism originates from a strong hybridization between the Ce 4f and nearest-neighbor Ce 5d electrons. It is conceivable that a strong Ce 4f-5d hybridization can induce an appreciable polarixation of the Ce 5d electrons. Therefore it is of interest to perform an X-ray magnetic Compton scattering investigation. This technique probes only the distribution of the spin moments. The measurements were performed at the ESRF using the end-station of the high energy beamline ID15A where best conditions for Compton scattering experiments can be achieved. We used a standard backscattering geometry. The sample was a single crystal. It had a thickness N 1.5 mm and covering a surface of -6 x 4 mm'. The X-ray beam probed only a surface of -3 x 1 mm'. The data were recorded at 10 K. B,,, was applied perpendicular to the c axis with B,,, = 0.92 T.</p></div>		</body>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>the Rh 4d electrons carry a very small moment, in agreement with the neutron diffraction result. The spin magnetic moment of the Ce 5d electrons is antiparallel to the bulk magnetization and therefore to the Ce 4f orbital moment. In addition this moment is not small relative to the Ce 4f moment. These results are at variance with results obtained for numerous Ce compounds. They suggest that it is the strong hybridization between the Ce 4f and nearest-neighbor Ce 5d electrons rather than the Kondo effect which is at the origin of the anomalously large Curie temperature of CeRh3Bz.</p><p>[l] J.
