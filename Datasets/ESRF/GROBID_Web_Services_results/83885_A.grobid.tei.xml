<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Report: Cl K-edge and I L3-edge XANES spectra of a series of solid and solution samples were measured using the low energy XAS facilities at BM28. The data were were analysed using the Athena software of the Demeter package. Raw data from the beamline was extracted and combined for each scan using a Python script.</p><p>The samples which were measured are shown below:</p><p>Solid samples were mounted on carbon tape and solution samples were prepared in Tol/MeOH (1:1), THF and cyclohexane with concentration in the range of 2.5-25 mM (depending on solubility with typical conc. 15-20 mM).</p><p>Cl K-edge spectra of solid samples showed a clear difference between halogen bonded Cl (PB's Cl) and free chloride (TBACl). Halogen bonding resulted in a pre-edge feature, high whiteline and a small shift in the edge position to higher energy (~ 2 eV).</p><p>These spectra changed significantly in solution using THF. The pre-edge feature in PB's Cl sample (9 mg in 5 mL) disappeared and was replaced by a new peak after the whiteline. Otherwise, the two spectra are nearly identical with the same edge position. This detectable difference will allow reliable detection of halogen bonds to chloride anion in THF solutions.</p><p>Similar measurements were performed at I L 3 -edge. PB's I sample has 2 different I environment (donor and acceptor) while PB's Cl sample has only one (acceptor). Their spectra are boardly similar with little to no whiteline feature, in contrast with the spectrum of TBAI. The differences between halogen bonded iodide and non-halogen-bonded iodide spectra in solid state are thus established.</p><p>In solution, the spectra of TBAI and PB's I did not change significantly other an increased boardening of the peaks. The XANES spectrum of IPFB showed no whiteline.</p><p>The derivative plot of the edge region showed a clearer picture: the spectra of PB's I corresponds to a combination of aryl iodide (e.g. IPFB) and iodide (e.g. TBAI) signal.</p><p>Thus, it is difficult to determine whether the halogen bond Iï‚¼I exist in solution using I L 3 -edge XANES. To verify this, spectra of I 2 and I 2 +pyridine in cyclohexane were collected. The halogen bond between I 2 and pyridine in cyclohexane has been established previously using UV/Vis measurements, and comparison of these spectra will confirm if the intereaction is detectable by I L 3 -edge XANES.</p><p>Little difference was detected between the two spectra, proving that I L3-edge XANES is unsuitable for detection of halogen bonds with iodide anions in solution.</p><p>Conclusions: While Cl K-edge XANES proved effective in detecting halogen bonding to chloride anion, I L 3 -edge XANES proved ineffective. Characterisation of halogen bonds with iodide will likely require measurements at I K-edge (33.18 keV). These will also benefit from the availability of EXAFS, which will provide vital information on halogen bond length in solution.</p></div>			</div>
