<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Reinforcement of elastomers with colloidal particles is a well-known fact that has been widely investigated but its mechanism still remains not fully understood. Therefore, we intended to investigate a series of welldefined composites. The parameters involved are the type of elastomer (EPR and SBR), whether it is crosslinked (dicumyl peroxide) or not and the type of filler (carbon black, hydroxylated or hydrophobic pyrogenic silicas). SAXS and uniaxial stretching measurements are performed on samples originating from the same batch.The aim of the project was to determine the long range structure and the relaxation times of this series of samples unstrained and strained by uniaxial stretching at several elongations by means of dynamic X-ray scattering (or X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, XPCS). Measurements were made at the BM2 beamline. X-ray energy was 7.9 keV and the sample to detector distance was 2.10 m. In order to perform SAXS measurements at ultra small angles (USAXS), background arising from the guard slits has to be reduced. After polishing the tantalum cylinder of the guard slits, the background is concentrated in two perpendicular thin streaks. Therefore a crosshair beamstop consisting of 300 µm platinum wire was used instead of the 500µm diameter disc. To obtain a coherent X-ray beam, the primary slits were closed to 200 × 200 µm 2 and a circular pinhole (diameter = 10 µm) was used. This experimental set-up and the direct illumination CCD detector (22µm resolution) permitted to reach low q values (≅ 6 × 10 -4 Å -1 ) and to obtain a coherence factor β close to 0.17 [1]. The beam intensity on the sample was close to 2 × 10 6 photons/s for a 200 mA ring current. For each sample, exposure time was 1 second and 1000 (or 2000) frames were measured. The results obtained from the analysis of the intensity curves were presented at E-MRS (Strasbourg, 18-21 June 2002, invited lecture) and submitted for publication [2]. A paper dealing with XPCS results is in preparation. Results obtained for carbon black dispersed in EPR is given below as an example.</p></div>

From the analysis of the curves shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> and 4, the following information can be deduced: -the correlation time τ is much shorter for the uncross-linked composite than for the cross-linked one τ increases significantly in the stretched crosslinked sample whereas it remains almost the same for the uncross-linked composite (not shown here) τ does not vary as q -2 , the absolute value of the exponent is smaller than 2</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
