<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment report for Proposal A02-2-880</head><p>Recently, the discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelate thin films has generated a great excitement, as their properties are believed to be related to the NiO2 plane, which are considered equivalent to the CuO2 planes in cuprates. Recently it has been reported that infinite layer nickelates exhibit peculiar magnetic excitations with a bandwidth of circa 200 meV in SrTiO3-capped NdNiO2 thin films. Here we are looking for the direct evidence of long-range magnetic order in infinite nickelate thin films, for which a high grazing geometry is then required. Although we could find in this unusual geometry a peak in the rotated channel, with almost no temperature dependence in the accessed range (10-300 K), we cannot firmly assume that this it is related to a peak stemming from the expected long-range magnetic order in infinitelayer nickelate thin films. The main concern of the Team that has conducted the experiment, is about the nature of the Crystal Truncation Rod (CTR) measurement which rendered around the (-0.5 0.5 0.5) position a practically one single pixel-like peak, please see figure below (greencurve).</p><p>Resonant Elastic X-ray Scattering (REXS) and Surface Resonant X-Ray Diffraction (SRXRD) experiments were performed on the D2AM beamline equipped with a cryofurnace. The sample was a 10-nm-thick films of NdNiO2 grown on a SrTiO3 (001) substrate with a SrTiO3 capping layer deposited by pulsed laser deposition and on which at ID32 in a previous RIXS experiment we could observe clear signatures of spin-excitation 1 . X-ray Resonant Magnetic Scattering (XRMS) measurements were carried out at the energy of the Ni K-edge around the (-1/2, 1/2, L) crystal truncation rod (CTR). First, we have tested that we could obtain signatures of a magnetic diffraction peak for the prototypical NiO single crystal in a very high gracing geometry, and we could get similar results as Barbier et al. Basically we measured the [½, ½, ½] antiferromagnetic diffraction plane in grazing scattering geometry at 300 K 2 . The results are shown in the figure below. Although less intense we could nevertheless observe the AFM peak in the grazing geometry, which confirmed that we can use this set-up geometry for our nickelate system that can be synthesized uniquely as a thin film. However, given the doubtful result, we thought that it would be better the benchmark the set-up for a thin film system where the longrange AFM is very well known. Therefore, the energy scan was acquired at Ni K-edge in the energy range of 8.327 keV to 8.346 keV in a very grazing geometry for the infinite-layer sample. We can see in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> that the peak is resonating at the Ni K-edge even after mounting the polarization analyzer. 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 1100 1200 Peak 1/2,1/2,1/2 [rotated] q [degree] 0.49° 0.25° 0.64° 0.78° 0.97° 1.45° 1.93°3 00K 0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.8 2.1 60 80 100 Area 1/2,1/2,1/2 [rotated] Incidence [degrees]  SRXRD spectra were recorded at seven different temperatures <ref type="bibr">(6, 28.6, 70, 89, 128, 228, and 300 K)</ref>.

Further measurements are required to make a final decision about our results. 1. Krieger, G. et al. Charge and Spin Order Dichotomy in NdNiO2 Driven by the Capping Layer. Phys. <ref type="bibr">Rev.
