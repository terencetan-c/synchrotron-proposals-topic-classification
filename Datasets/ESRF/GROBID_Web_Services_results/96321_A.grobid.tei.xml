<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Ferroelectric oxide thin films were first measured at a conventional single crystal diffraction beamline BM01, which showed promising results. The measurement plan was that we conduct grazing-incident step-scan experiments in reflection mode using the pixel area detector PILATUS 2M installed at SNBL and vary the incident angle of the beam to optimize the surface sensitivity of the beam and the coverage of the reciprocal spatial volume. The plan was successfully executed and we observed diffuse rings around crystal truncation rods, indicating isotropic arrangement of in-plane domain structures arising from the strain effect of cubic strontium titanate substrate (right panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In addition to these diffuse rings, we found periodic patterns of sharp candle-shaped figures in every half h, k, and l directions, potentially arising from an antiferroic order (middle panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). These patterns were not previsouly reported or studied and will thus help us gain deeper insights on structure-property correlations of the films.</p><p>Nevertheless, the measurements were met with limitations. In particular, the relatively large incident angle of the beam (2 -3Â°) created a shadow of the crystal and prevented us from clear observation of in-plane scatterings. The collected 0 th layer evidently shows that it lacks intensities (left panel of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This was a major problem, because the 0 th layer is the projection of the structure, from which we can learn about both the in-plane and out-of plane polarization structures of the sample. The measurements also suffered from the large footprint of the beam, which resulted in bad resolution at higher angles. Hence, the acquired data will be complemented with high energy experiments to minimize shadow of the crystal as well as allow for small scattering angle and reduce the smearing effect. respectively from left to right at BM01. The red line on 0kl layer indicates the 0 th layer of hk-plane and the hk2 layer shows two different color contrast. The h0l layer is a merged reconstruction of omega and phi scan.</p><p>We would like to note that the submission of this experimental report was delayed due to challenges met in the analysis of the data. The lack of proper software for analyzing the three-dimensional diffuse scattering data of thin film structures left us with the only option to write our own software. We will further update the report in the case of publication. Lastly, we would like to thank the SNBL staff, especially Dr. Dmitry Chernyshov, who helped our experiment throughout the beamtime and supported us to explore experimental possibilities.</p><p>We also appreciate the access to the SNBL toolbox software, which was a great help in preprocessing the data for the analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
