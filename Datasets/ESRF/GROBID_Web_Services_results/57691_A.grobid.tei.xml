This allows following subsequent structural changes with ms time resolution for instance the formation of decorated vesicles or of bigger agglomerates. For this purpose we employed dioleylphospatidylcholine (DOPC) vesicles with a radius of ~50 or 400 nm (obtained by extrusion), which have a form factor minimum around q = 0.035 nm -1 . The most relevant q range then was 0.01-0.5 nm. This very low q is important to see whether during the process larger agglomerates are formed as decorated vesicles. The short time range, where fast adhesion to the vesicles occurs (decoration; œÑch = 10 ms-10 s) will be studied with correspondingly higher time resolution up to 10 s. We always employed DOPC vesicles at pH = 7.4 and they will be mixed with SiNPs and cationic polymer grafted SiO2@PDMAEMA-NP of core diameter 15 or 55 nm in order to see how their size affects the adhesion scenario. As another parameter we controlled the interaction potential between membrane and NPs by variation of the membrane charge. This was done by employing vesicles where 2 and 10 mol% of DOPC were substituted by anionic 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid sodium salt (DMPA), thereby introducing a systematic repulsion between the membrane and the anionic SiNPs or systematic attraction of SiO2@PDMAEMA-NPs.</p><p>First we compared the initial final state of those systems observing that there is no difference between initial and final state for pure NPs with vesicle (uncharged or charged), so we skipped further stopped flow experiments for those systems (figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). In contrary SAXS-data of SiO2@PDMAEMA (RH = 42 nm) and corresponding vesicle NP mixture differ from each other where a time altering intensity increase in the low qrange can be observed for the vesicle-NP mixture. Depending on NP size all data show a first intensity minima at q = 0.16801 nm -1 for SiO2@PDMAEMA-and SiO2-NP and at q = 0.18822 nm -1 and q = 0.503 nm -1 confirming the presence of NPs core with a mean core radius of 26.4 nm and 8.3 nm respectively. As mentioned before scattering data of SiO2@PDMAEMA-vesicle mixtures show an altering intensity increase compared to scattering data of pure NPs thus we expecting the formation of larger aggregates probably as decorated vesicles.</p><p>In principel from the ratio of the forward scattering I0 compared to that of the SiO2@PDMAEMA-NPs we can calculate the aggregation number Nagg of NPs for one vesicle but the measured q-range is too small and not all data reach a plateau. The expected I0 should be 10 times higher at q = 0.001 nm -1 (calculated from equation 1) so we only can estimate I0 value for initial and final state of those mixtures to estimate Nagg (table <ref type="table">1</ref> and <ref type="table">2</ref>). Due to an altering intensity increase for SiO2@PDMAEMA-vesicle mixture we decided to study the vesicle surface charge density (tunable with DMPA content) and also the [NP]/[Ves]-ratio as parameter.

This we may interpret such that immediately after mixing of anionic vesicles with cationic SiO2@PDMAEMA-NP a quick formation of decorated vesicles begins with a netto charge reversal from anionic vesicles to cationic decorated vesicles results. This subsequently shields additional SiO2@PDMAEMA-NPs from further adsorption and those mixture needs longer for relaxation. Assuming that each monomer unit of SiO2@PDMAEMA is positively charged, we may estimate the maximum number of charges per particle to be ~26400. Comparing this value with the maximal amount of counter charges per one vesicle (18625 for DOPC/DMPA 90/10 mol%) shows us that in principal a small amount of NPs is enough for a charge conversion. One has to keep in mind, that the real charge ratio per vesicle or NP is quiet smaller due surrounding counter ions, non the less only the detaching NP area with vesicle surface neutralizes the charge. Comparing œÑdecay values at same ratios as a function of the vesicle charged density those values are generally higher for lower DMPA content and thus a longer relaxation times can be observed for less charged vesicles. Typically, a higher charge results in stronger attractive interaction between NPs and vesicles and thus to quicker adsorption. In general, our experiment sheds a lot of light onto the interesting and important interactions between nanoparticles and vesicles and how these are governed by the electrostatic conditions between them. These results will be a solid basis for further experiments in that direction that will substantially enhance our understanding of such complex systems.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Shown are example of pure NPs and NP-vesicle mixtures for initial and final state: Left: SiO2-NPs with two different core radii and vesicle sizes; right: SiO2@PDMAEMA-NPs.
