<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>The experiment SC 5329 was performed on the nanobranch of ID13 with a beam cross-section of (70x70) nm² at an energy of 13 keV with exposure times usually 50 ms per point. The goal of the experiment was for perform high resolution (at sub-micron scale) XRF/ XRD mapping of tactile hair sensilla of the spider Cupiennius salei to study the chitin-protein structure and composition of these mechanosensors. We were able to use again the fibre-tracking macro developed by the beam line scientist, during our previous experiment, that allowed us to acquire of multiple maps region along shaft of a hair sensillum in an automated fashion. This experiment was complementary to the measurements previously performed in experiment SC 5187, since in the recent experiment we focused on the role of water within the hydrated hair sensilla. Additionally, besides samples listed in the initial proposal we were able to study the sensilla in an actuated state in dry and hydrated conditions. Also, submicron resolution maps of hair shaft cross-sections were studied looking into the distribution of metal and halogen ions with XRF. Due to the good support of the beamline scientist and we were able to was to measure all planned samples and a few additional ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The goal is to quantify chitin/protein ratio, the chitin fibre orientation and compare it between the different regions along the hair. For that, the tactile hair sensilla were dissected from the tarsus of C. salei keeping the hair socket intact, which anchors the sensillum in the cuticle. For that, the cuticle was manually cut into sections with a thickness of less than 50 μm but with a length of up to 1 mm. The samples were glued away from the region of interest (ROI) to silicon nitride (SiN) membranes (1 μm thickness) to provide a mechanical support without compromising signal/noise and increasing background signal. Two different approaches were used to hydrate the sample; in the first approach, the cavity of the SiN membrane was filled with deionized and filtered water, than vanillin was applied on the frame and closed with a second membrane. The membrane sandwich was than sealed with super glue or nail polish. This setup ensured the hydration of the sensilla, but had the drawback, that gas bubbles formed at during acquisition of high-resolution maps, which can move the sensilla during the measurement. To prevent this we also prepared membrane sandwiches in which we placed a hydrogel prepared form low melting agarose (1.5 % wt), to facilitate a humid environment for the sensillum, which indeed corresponds better to the natural state. The risk of this sample setup is condensation at the membrane, however, we did not observe any interference during the measurements.</p><p>Figure 1: SiN membrane with glued tactile hair sensilla and PDMS blocks (a). Tactile hair are bend and fixed behind a PDMS block (b). Membrane with embedded tactile hair cross-sections (c).</p><p>As we were interested if the actuation on the sensilla had an impact on the fibre architecture samples with bend sensilla were prepared. For that the sensilla were glued in their relaxed state on the membrane then a small block of PDMS, which was cut out from a 100 µm thick PDMS film, as placed next to the sensillum and it was bend behind the block (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). These samples were also measured in under hydrated conditions. To understand the distribution of naturally occurring halogen and metal ions in the hair shaft, individual sensilla were embedded in EpoFix Resin and cut into 10 µm cross-sections, which also were placed on SiN membranes.</p><p>To detect the typical chitin-protein fibre diffractions we measured at a q range ranging from 0.1 to 40 nm -1 . Compared to the previous experiment, we increased the exposure time to 50 ms to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, considering the radiation damage. The XRF detector was optimized for each sample to obtain the best possible outcome. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> a&amp;b 2D XRD plots of a dry and hydrated sensillum are shown, respectively. The signal was averaged over different areas of a single map and azimuthally integrated. The orange plot shows the respective background signal which will be subtracted and the individual chitin-(protein) peaks will be fitted. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2 c</ref> shows a SAXS intensity map (q range 0.2 -2 nm -1 ) of an intact and dry hair. Based on the interfaces of the hollow cavity in the hair shaft, which are indicated by the yellow arrowheads, the cuticle facing and contact side of the hair were defined, respectively. The panel in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref> shows XRF maps of a hair cross-section for selected ions. It can be clearly seen that for example manganese is found in the periphery of the hair and the microtrichs while zinc is located at two regions in the shaft itself.</p><p>We aim to correlate the distribution of ions and the chitin-protein architecture of the tactile hair sensilla with their mechanical properties in future. Additionally, we performed high-resolution maps XRD/XRF of C. salei tibia section as well as course maps of the sections prepared from locust ovipositor. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>Center for Molecular Bioengineering B CUBE, Tatzberg 41, 01307 Dresden -DE</figDesc></figure>
