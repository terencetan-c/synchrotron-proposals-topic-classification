<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>This is preliminary report on an experiment carried out at DUBBLE from 30th of March till 4th of April 2010. This report cover a description of the experimental setup and conclusion on data obtained from e-yield measurements using the electron yield detector.</p><p>The e-yield detector was mounted on a goniometer the way that a sample was on the centre of rotation. During measurements the sample was inclined at 2.5 0 with respect to the incoming X-ray beam. Using slits, the X-ray beam size was set to 3 mm (width) by 0.8 mm (height). This beam size produced a beam spot covering an area of ~45.8 mm 2 . The detector was operated with standard gas mixture of 25 % isobutene and 75% Helium; drift voltage of -1 500 V, cathode potential -550 V and with anode held at ground.</p><p>As a reference sample to test detector was used NiO/Ni thin file.</p><p>The structure of NiO/Ni consisted of 150 nm layer of Ni covered by layer NiO of thickness 25 nm deposited onto a Si (100) substrate.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> is shown the typical Auger electron spectrum collected with the e-yield detector at the Ni K-edge. This electron spectrum is divided into 4 different electron regions. After integrating the number of counts within each region, the EXAFS spectrum for 4 energy regions are obtained. Before performing full EXAFS analysis, the EXAFS spectra have to be normalised on incoming X-ray beam.  We also found out that sample holders made of alumina, bras, copper can be used for powder samples e.g. CoMoO 4 , Fe 3 MoO 4 , Fe 3 O 4 deposited on conductive carbon tape. Data obtained from powder samples are being analysed.</p><p>We also carried out test experiment with the GMSD on Ti K-edge. Aim of the experiment was to obtain information on the structure of the surface layer as well as to see different between bulk and surface of TiO 2 /Ti and TiO 2 /SS treated at 120/550 0 C and 550 0 C respectively . The surface layer of TiO 2 can be in a form of rutile or anastase. The preliminary results on this work are presented below. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> are shown EXAFS spectra obtained by dividing PHD spectra into two electron energy regions; high energy window for electrons emerging close to the surface and low energy window for electrons that originated in the bulk. The same TiO 2 /Ti_120 sample was measured in fluorescence mode which gave us the EXAFS spectrum of Ti metal as can be seen in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> Fluorescence EXAFS of TiO 2 /Ti_120 collected at Ti K-edge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Our preliminary results on the energy resolved XAS collected by e-yield detector show that it is possible to distinguish the structure of the surface from that of the bulk material, as we demonstrated on preliminary results on NiO/Ni and TiO 2 /Ti_120 samples.</p><p>EXAFS from bulk -Ti metal EXAFS from surface rutile form of TiO 2</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1 Left -Typical PHD recorded at Ni K-edge showing sampled 4 different energy regions.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head>Figure 2 3</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2 3 Energy resolved EXAFS spectra of the NiO/Ni using low energy window referring to bulk and high energy window referring to surface. In order to see clearly changes in magnitude of the sharp edge, in Figure 2 are shown EXAFS spectra of the same NiO/Ni sample corresponding to low and high Auger electron energy windows. The low Auger electron energy refers to electrons coming from the bulk (b) (Ni) and high Auger electron energy is assigned to electrons escaping from the surface (a) (NiO). Increase in magnitude of the sharp edge (~8341 eV) from 1.05 to 1.25 is evidence of NiO contribution to EXAFS spectra at different Auger electron energies.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,183.12,321.48,229.08,170.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
