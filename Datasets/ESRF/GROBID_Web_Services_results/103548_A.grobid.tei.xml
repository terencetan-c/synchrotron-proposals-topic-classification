<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction and motivation:</head><p>This experiment aimed at performing X-ray speckle-based tomography on ovarian, endometrial, and liver tissues. This study allowed us to understand the local changes in the microstructures resulting from a specific pathology (endometriosis, steatosis), and a cryopreservation procedure (vitrification). To that end, X-ray speckle-based imaging (SBI) has been used, due to its high sensitivity to small density differences in unstained soft tissues. Unlike other techniques, SBI also provides additional information about small-angle scattering, known as dark-field. Dark-field signal was used to improve the visualisation of sub-resolution microstructure alterations and to quantitatively detect the orientation of anisotropic structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results so far:</head><p>From a combined analysis of phase and dark-field tomograms, we were able to identify the local changes in the microstructures of unstained tissues as well as to detect sub-resolution alterations caused by specific pathologies. Several samples included in different materials (paraffin, ethanol, osmium, tissuetek) have been scanned: human liver with steatosis from patients of different ages, and bovine and human ovaries with endometriosis. Both high-resolution and medium-resolution scans were performed, with a pixel size of 1.3 µm and 3.1 µm, respectively. The main problem was the strong absorption at 19 keV of liver samples, therefore we had to change the energy to 26.5 keV to minimise radiation damage effects. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, two X-ray phase-contrast axial slices are shown as a result of a preliminary analysis, both with highresolution set-up. On the left-hand side, a ROI of a virtual slice of a human liver sample in ethanol. Lipidic aggregates are clearly visible as dark circles. On the right-hand side, a ROI of a virtual slice of a bovine ovary. Follicles are visible and conclusions about cryopreservation protocol's effectiveness can be drawn by looking at the regions near ova. A further analysis of the data is currently ongoing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>The findings in this field could be applied to enhance procedures for preserving fertility, especially for young women and prepubertal girls who face the risk of infertility due to chemotherapeutic treatments. Additionally, through dark-field analysis of liver tissue, we were able to identify sub-micrometer lipid aggregates that would otherwise remain invisible. With this study, we were able to make an unparalleled assessment of the extent of steatosis severity.
