<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Report:</head><p>Previous to this experiment we have demonstrated, that a one dimensional focusing of hard x-rays (10-30 keV) using linear silicon fresnel zone plates (FZPs) can be achieved <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. By using a tilted arrangement of the FZP, the effective height of the diffractive structures could be tuned to match the optimum phase shift over a wide range of photon energies (see <ref type="bibr">Fig 1,</ref><ref type="bibr">left)</ref>. For a FZP with 350nm zone width, a diffraction efficiency of up to 40% was measured. The aims of this experiment were:</p><p>• To test lenses with 100nm outermost zone width (and thus improved spatial resolution) at energies around 12 keV photon energy. • To combine two linear lenses in an orthogonal arrangement for two-dimensional focusing.</p><p>• To test the spatial resolution of such an arrangement by scanning test objects.</p><p>• To match the FZPs geometries to the transverse coherence lengths of the ID13 undulator beam line, in order to collect all coherent photons.</p><p>• To demonstrate a flux of 10 8 phot/sec and a flux density in the order of 10 10 phot/sec/µm 2 in the 1 A wavelength range.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: By a tilting of a linear FZP with respect to the x-ray beam, the diffraction efficiency can be tuned to maximum <ref type="bibr">(left)</ref>. SEM image of a linear Si FZP with 100 nm outermost zone width (right) Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows an example of a linear FZP with 100nm zone width fabricated by electron beam lithography and selective wet chemical etching of &lt;110&gt; oriented Si substrates. To match the transverse coherence of the ID13 undulator source at 12.4 keV photon energy, the apertures of the two orthogonally mounted linear lenses was chosen to be 200 µm in horizontal and 50 µm in vertical direction, resulting in focal lengths of 200 mm and 50 mm repectively. By scanning a test object with electroplated gold structures (made by M. Panitz, Univ. of Göttingen), we were able to determine the spatial resolution of the setup. Although the absorption of the test structures was only in the order of 6%, structures down to 200 nm in both scanning directions could be resolved. An evaluation of line scans across the test object revealed the modulation transfer function of our set-up (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). A cut-off frequency of approx 2.5 µm -1 corresponding to 200nm lines and spaces can be derived. The fact that resolution does not match the expected resolving power of the FZP, which should correspond to it's outermost zone width, may be due to mechanical instabilities of the setup (piezo-scanner, monochromator).</p><p>The efficiency of each of the two lenses was measured to be 24%, meaning that the complete set-up has a diffraction efficiency of just below 6%. Due to good match to the beamlines coherence properties, a flux of around 10 9 photons per second was achieved. This gives a flux density in the order of 10 10 phot/sec/µm 2 , which corresponds to a gain of 10 5 compared to the incoming flux density of the beam line.</p><p>In addition to the initially planned experiments, we also used the two-dimensionally focused spot to perform micro-diffraction experiments on kevlar fibres. The obtained information about the radial arrangement of the kevlar microcrystals is in good agreement with previous investigations done at ID13 using one-dimensional focusing wave-guides, and proved the usefulness of the tested focusing device. A pre-aligned assembly of the tested lenses is now available at ID13 for further user experiments.</p><p>A publication on these experiments to be submitted to Applied Physics Letters is presently under preparation. Future work will focus on the implementation of blazed Fresnel lenses with greatly improved efficiency into the coherence-matched focusing scheme.</p><p>We gratefully acknowledge the help of beamline scientist Manfred Burghammer in this experiment. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2: Scanning transmission x-ray micrograph of a Au test object consisting of 350 nm thick electroplated Au structures.
